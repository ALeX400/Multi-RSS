  Some games exist to let the player just kick back and relax, but when it comes to the world of the tactical RPG, that's not the case at all. The very best tactical RPGs encourage constant deep thinking, resulting in either heart-breaking defeat or immensely satisfying victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it be elegant game systems with a lot of depth, complex systems that require hundreds of hours to master, or straightforward maniacal difficulty, these tactical RPGs all require the player to lock in and think deeply before making the next move.

  Releasing with little fanfare in 2014,
  <em>
   The Banner Saga
  </em>
  was the little game that could build up a small but passionate fanbase that grew ever larger as two more sequels were released in quick succession, built on the same striking art style and addictive tactical RPG gameplay, becoming one of the best tactical RPGs made about historical events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only does the grid-based battle system require players to think carefully about how they put their beloved characters in danger, but the framing device of a long pilgrimage means the player needs to make difficult choices along the way that can affect upcoming battles. Every decision requires a lot of thought, particularly for a band of characters that are so easy to love.

  Though the tactical RPG genre technically emerged in the West with wargaming, the genre has transcended borders and found a brilliant home in Japan who have created some of the very best tactical RPGs ever made, including the indomitable
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on its infamous idea that characters can permanently die,
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  games are renowned for their powerful stories, memorable characters, and brutal difficulty.
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  , the latest entry into the franchise, is one of the best the series has ever done (not to mention its steamiest romances), and its combat certainly requires the deep thinking that the very best tactical RPGs do.

  The original
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  game has a reasonable claim to being one of the very first digital tactical RPGs ever made, and with its reboot in the 2010s and the release of
  <em>
   XCOM 2
  </em>
  , that pedigree hasn't gone anywhere. These games are known for punishing rolls, difficult encounters, and permanently murdered teammates while fighting aliens.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that results in a stressful experience where the wrong move could cascade into disastrous results, throwing away hours of progress and customizing the perfect squad of the best classes. With their back to the wall, a player needs to think their way out of dire straits, resulting in some of the most fun tactical RPG action ever made.

  Tactical RPG fans have long bemoaned that the world never got a proper modern sequel to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  as they should have, and it doesn't seem like they ever will. However, Square Enix clearly heard some of the fans and threw them a bone in the form of
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  , a spiritual successor to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  that was released in 2022.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like its spiritual predecessor,
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  demands a deep understanding of its complex and difficult game systems, making it a little tricky to get into for new players but an absolute delight for veteran fans of the genre who value deep-thinking gameplay over all else.

  Anyone who has played the board game version of
  <em>
   Gloomhaven
  </em>
  will know the divine kind of stress the game provokes where teams need to plan out their moves far in advance in a series of fiendishly difficult dungeon crawls.
 </p>
 <p>
  The real deep thinking comes not just from team composition but because of the central gameplay of the mechanic of being able to take the top action of one card and the bottom of another. That means making tough choices, removing inefficiencies wherever possible, and inevitably falling into bad situations where no good option remains available. Deep thinking becomes the only way to survive.

  After the smash success of
  <em>
   FTL
  </em>
  , many wondered how beloved indie studio Subset Games would follow up the simple but fiendish game design of their ship combat simulator. The answer came in 2018 with one of the most diabolically simple but mind-bending games ever made in
  <em>
   Into the Breach
  </em>
  (which is also one of the best TRPGs on the Switch).
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking the form of a mix of chess,
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  , and apocalyptic sci-fi fiction,
  <em>
   Into the Breach
  </em>
  is a grid-based game where the player sees what the enemy is about to do before they do it, and they need to figure out a way to use limited resources to minimize the damage and fight back. What starts off simple becomes incredibly complicated, resulting in staring at the same board for over an hour while trying to figure out the right solution.

  Sometimes, a tactical RPG fan doesn't care too much about the story or anything else. All they want is raw, visceral, tactical RPG action that can keep them satiated for years to come. For that kind of fan, there's no better franchise than
  <em>
   Disgaea
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Disgaea 5
  </em>
  is possibly the best in the franchise, delivering on its complex tactical RPG gameplay with near-infinite levels of dungeoneering and character customization to be done, all in the pursuit of better loot, stats, and harder challenges to conquer. It's the platonic ideal of a deep-thinking tactician who loves solving the puzzle of tactical gameplay.

  As if anything else could top this list. Commonly listed not just as one of the best tactical RPGs of all time but one of the very best RPGs of all time,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  has become a beloved mainstay of the RPG world, both for its story but also for its elegant and brutal tactical game design that inspired many more
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games to come.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking place on an isometric grid-based battlefield, the complexity comes from CT (Charge Time), meaning that actions aren't instant but occur based on the speed of the individual unit. Mix that with terrain, height advantages, and directional considerations, and a simple idea becomes instantly complex, where a player needs to think far in advance in order to succeed.

      <title>Best Free Co-Op Games You Can Play On Steam</title>

  <strong>
   Co-op
  </strong>
  has been a staple of gaming for most of the medium's lifespan, although its prominence can fluctuate from time to time. While arguably associated more with PvP games, the PC scene is certainly no stranger to cooperative games, particularly ones that are played online. Local co-op options can be a bit harder to find since the feature is not typically prioritized on platforms like
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  , but they also exist and there are some great titles out there.

  When looking for
  <strong>

  </strong>
  to play with friends, players will likely gravitate either to team-based shooters or MMOs, two genres that have produced more than their fair share of great releases. However, there are plenty of
  <strong>
   great Steam co-op games
  </strong>
  that go beyond those categories.

   , although the year is still in its infancy. Furthermore, a few promising titles are on the horizon, which can be checked in the discussion below. While more of a multiplayer hero shooter, Strinova should be tried out by players who are looking for an anime-style project that plays with perspective. Alternatively, they can check out a social deduction game that has been around for a couple of years. Click below to jump directly to this title.

  In a month that was not lacking in major free-to-play titles,
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  still managed to make a huge splash, arguably eclipsing
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  in the process. While hardly flawless, the open-world survival game is nevertheless an impressive achievement and well worth a download to see if it clicks with someone. An alien infestation driven by human corporations has caused corruption to spread across the land, mutating humans, animals, and objects in the process. Meta-humans are in charge of fighting back this chaos, all the while trying to learn who exactly is behind this apocalyptic situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  supports solo play, and one could argue that this type of survival experience benefits from the sense of isolation presented by a single-player run. However, Starry Studio has implemented both PvP multiplayer and co-op. The former is a mixed bag that can be largely ignored if someone does not want to engage with it, even if they opt to play with other players. Conversely, co-op generally results in a superior experience, even if
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's implementation of the feature leaves something to be desired.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can set up either a Party, Hive, or Warband, depending on how many friends will be joining the run. While they all have their uses, Hive might be the best option for those who are planning to mostly play together, as it will allow them to effectively run through the campaign as a unit.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  can get repetitive at times, an issue that is lessened when a few friends are along for the ride.

  <em>
   Alien Swarm
  </em>
  might just be Valve's most forgotten game, although the 2010 release is by no means bad. In fact, anyone seeking a twin-stick co-op shooter can certainly do worse than this title; however, they should consider jumping into
  <em>
   Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop
  </em>
  instead of the original game. For one,
  <em>
   Reactive Drop
  </em>
  is still being updated despite coming out in 2017, which cannot be said for
  <em>
   Alien Swarm
  </em>
  . Secondly and more importantly, the expansion does exactly what it advertises: improve the base experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not lacking a PvP,
  <em>
   Reactive Drop
  </em>
  is primarily about co-op. 8 players can take on one of the game's 10+ campaigns, each consisting of a couple of missions. Naturally, the gameplay loop boils down to players going up against wave after wave of enemies while they try to work toward a level's endpoint. Straightforward as this concept is,
  <em>
   Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop
  </em>
  manages to incorporate quite a bit of nuance through its classes and tactics-driven gameplay. This is not one of those forgiving games that allow players to effectively disregard the rest of the team as they live out their Rambo fantasy; no, teamwork is necessary for survival.

  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  is just an all-around solid free-to-play sandbox game. While not necessarily pushing the genre forward, it does cover the basics well while providing an enjoyable multiplayer experience. Friends can live together on the same server, seeing how long they can survive on a procedurally generated island as they steadily work towards the campaign's endpoint (which does exist). Death is permanent in survival mode, so the stakes are fairly high.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its vibrant and simple visuals,
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  does not pull all that many punches, and it even has a couple of challenging boss fights. Multiplayer helps ease the difficulty somewhat, but it does not make the game a walk in the park either.

  is a first-person horror game where players can join forces with up to eight others and try to survive the zombie apocalypse with over 30 weapons at their disposal. There is proximity-based voice communication, so the further players are from one another, the harder it is for them to communicate.
 </p>

  Taking inspiration from contemporary sources like

  <em>

   Unsolved Case
  </em>
  casts players as detectives and puts them on a serial killer case. In order to catch the Cryptic Killer, the two sleuths will need to solve a series of puzzles, and teamwork is the name of the game. Players will need to constantly communicate since each party is shown just a fragment of a room's overall puzzle, and a solution can only be found by combining each person's clues.

 <p>
  Lasting approximately an hour,
  <em>
   Unsolved Case

  is an enjoyable brain-teaser. While the
  <strong>
   free co-op game
  </strong>
  does not have much replay value, it is designed to act as a sample of what Eleven Puzzles' future Cryptic Killer games will contain.

  A blast from the past,
  <em>
   Sven Co-Op
  </em>
  feels like it has always been around in some form or another, even if it never quite reached the same level of popularity as something like
  <em>
   Garry's Mod
  </em>
  . Like all great Steam projects,
  <em>
   Sven Co-Op
  </em>
  can be traced back to
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  ; in fact, it started life as a mod for Valve's game. As suggested by the title, the developers sought to bring co-op to
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  , a straightforward promise that does not even begin to capture the sheer amount of content incorporated in this package.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays,
  <em>
   Sven Co-Op
  </em>
  is available as a standalone download on Steam, so it is completely free to play and does not even require owning
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  . Heck, it contains
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  within it (along with a bunch of maps for other games like
  <em>
   Opposing Force
  </em>
  ).
  <em>
   Sven Co-Op
  </em>
  is obviously dated by this point. Everything about it screams "early 2000s," and that is part of its charm. The mod was a pioneer in the co-op FPS market, and its gameplay is still rock-solid and fun to this day.

  finally hit the scene in 2023, coming out to a mixed reception due to a lack of content. While it is too early to predict that game's future, it will need some substantial updates if it wants to pick up momentum and convince fans to switch over from

 <p>
  Up to four players can combine forces to execute missions in their preferred way, which generally means going guns blazing or trying for a stealthier approach.

  <em>
   One-Armed Robber
  </em>
  was not Duhndal's first attempt at a ridiculous co-op game that takes a fairly popular genre and gives it a one-armed makeover. As suggested by the title, the gameplay revolves around a team of chefs who must run a kitchen and restaurant while dealing with wonky physics courtesy of only having a single arm. The game goes beyond just putting together dishes, as players are essentially put in charge of the full process, which means taking orders, preparing and cooking dishes, and taking them out to customers. Chaos is always just around the corner, and it tends to arrive quicker when more people are trying to make things work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to
  <em>
   One-Armed Robber
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   One-Armed Cook
  </em>
  does not have a story or any real progression. This game is designed to be as immediate and accessible as possible, encouraging friends to simply jump on for quick sessions and to see how long they can last before they burn everything to the ground. Duhndal has found a nice niche for itself, and while these games might never become full mainstream successes, they have found an audience that seems to enjoy their brand of silliness. Long may it continue.

  Like most good things,
  <em>
   Cry of Fear
  </em>
  started life as a
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  mod, before eventually expanding into its own beast. For a free-to-play game, this 2012 release has a staggering amount of content, including three campaigns and a whole host of supplementary content. New players should start with the standard single-player campaign, which teaches the base controls and goes through the core narrative. While hitting fairly standard beats for the horror genre,
  <em>
   Cry of Fear
  </em>
  tells a respectable story that manages to deliver a few genuine scares, as long as a player accepts that the visuals will be fairly dated.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing the main story, players can then jump into a dedicated co-op campaign, which casts them as police officers. Generally, this run covers many of the same stages as the single-player version, albeit told in reverse and with a few tweaks to the gameplay. The four-player co-op is fun on a gameplay level, but its story is meant to be experienced after the single-player campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore,
  <em>
   Cry of Fear
  </em>
  even has another co-op campaign called
  <em>
   Manhunt
  </em>
  , which was created in conjunction with the community. This tells a (relatively) new story and features a heavier focus on puzzles. Along with the standard campaign,
  <em>
   Cry of Fear
  </em>
  has so much free content that is generally high quality.

  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  has expanded a great deal over its lifespan, a process that saw an exciting but limited third-person shooter grow into one of the most ambitious and best free-to-play games on the market. Despite hitting a few speedbumps along the way since not every change or update was for the better, Digital Extremes deserves praise for what it has achieved over the last decade.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  can be treated as a single-player experience for the most part, and this sort of extends to the multiplayer component as well. Most missions can be taken on as part of a squad, and many people tend to just do their own thing rather than coordinate as a unit. Once someone is of a high enough level, they will steamroll through most encounters, to the point there is not much incentive to engage in teamwork. As such, it is very easy to get through these operations without having to interact with other people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the above is common when teaming up with strangers,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  is still supportive of multiplayer and online co-op. Four friends can have an absolute blast playing through most of the game's content together, an endeavor that should keep them busy for a couple of months. Co-op also makes grinding more manageable compared to solo runs.

  The world has been invaded by time-traveling dinosaurs in
  <em>
   Damnosaur.
  </em>
  Players take on the role of the pink-haired heroine, Proh, in this colorful anime-style shoot-em-up. Equipped with various weapons in her arsenal, Proh must survive for as long as she can against the endless waves of these prehistoric fiends and save Jollywood.
 </p>
 <p>
  The longer she lasts, the more dangerous the dinos become, from terrifying Tricepatops' to the towering T-rex – one touch from these dinos and Proh is dead.

  is split into short stories, all of which play out akin to escape rooms. Players can take on the challenges on their own, or they can opt to bring a few friends along for the ride. Focusing on puzzles and featuring decent visuals for a free-to-play indie game, this 2022 release can be a great way to spend a few hours, even though the scenarios themselves do not have much replay value.

 <p>
  While never nonsensical,
  <em>

  is also not afraid to really push someone's critical solving skills, delivering a few puzzles that can be real head-scratchers. The game generally avoids hand-holding players as well, so things can get complicated rather quickly.

  Players looking for a cooperative adventure that's akin to something like
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  should look into
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  . This free-to-play top-down MMOARPG sees players choosing from a variety of classes and embarking on a lengthy storyline set in the lands Arkesia.
 </p>
 <p>
  With fluid, fast-paced, and action-heavy combat,
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  is the perfect release to get that dungeon-crawling fix. The open-world is massive and there are tons of quests, raids, and side missions for players to complete. Although there is a PvP mode, players who wish to simply enjoy PvE-based combat can opt out of it.

  When the Old Ones' armies of monsters attack Etheria, the kingdom calls upon heroes to resist the invasion. Across an array of maps, these brave warriors must defend their towers against the evil hordes, a process that evolves engaging in satisfying action RPG gameplay.
  <em>
   Dungeon Defenders 2
  </em>
  is a fun tower defense game that prioritizes real-time combat, although there is still an element of strategy.
 </p>
 <p>
  In single-player, users can create a party of four heroes that can be swapped at a moment's notice. In co-op, different players assume the roles of these heroes. Initially, only a few characters are available, but more can be unlocked through gameplay. Although not one of the most active games on Steam,
  <em>
   Dungeon Defenders 2
  </em>
  still tends to average a few hundred players at a time, which is impressive for a smaller-scale title that has been out for nearly 6 years.

  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  was available for quite a while before debuting on Steam, so the game was already a known quantity when it debuted on Valve's platform. The Steam iteration garnered a mixed reception at launch, with one of the main criticisms being that the store page does not make it obvious that the game is still in open-beta. Taking everything into consideration,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  has amassed a poor reputation that does not necessarily echo the project's quality, even if the game itself still has a ways to go before it fulfills its potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it needs to be said that anyone who jumps into Singularity 6's title at this point needs to be aware that they are in store for a fairly light life/farming sim experience, and that extends to the co-op support. Each server holds up to 25 players, which is a decent size for this type of project; however, there are not currently all that many features designed around multiplayer. Consequently,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  is not presently a great
  <strong>
   co-op free Steam game
  </strong>
  . That said, it might earn that distinction in time.

  <em>
   Unfortunate Spacemen
  </em>
  is a social deduction-type game where players take on the roles of the eponymous astronauts. In the standard Shapeshifter Mode, 16 players are dropped into matches and tasked with completing certain challenges, all in the hopes of making it out in one piece. Similar to popular real-life games like
  <em>
   Blood on the Clocktower
  </em>
  , or video games like
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  , not every spaceman has the group's well-being in mind; in fact, they are intent on helping out an alien monster that happens to be roaming the map. The latter is also controlled by a player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Unfortunate Spacemen
  </em>
  's default mode qualifies as co-op since most players are part of the same team. However, as is the case in quite a few of these types of releases, coordination and cooperation are not always prioritized, especially since players should be wary of each other. Fortunately,
  <em>
   Unfortunate Spacemen
  </em>
  has two separate modes that can be played in co-op (along with single-player. There is a story mode that supports up to six players, and it is a fun diversion for its two-hour duration. Alternatively, 10 players can just jump into survival to see how long they can withstand the alien hordes. Simple but enjoyable.

  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's story supports 4-player online co-op, but it is not free-to-play; however, the multiplayer side of things does not require any monetary investment. And, while the campaign is a decent attempt at adapting the franchise's gameplay to an open-world setting,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's online modes are more likely to keep players coming back for more, especially this long after the title's release. As always, 343 constantly cycles through the multiplayer modes, tweaking the playlists to ensure there is some variety on offer. While it has garnered quite a bit of criticism over the years,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  nevertheless has a robust selection of multiplayer stalwarts that should be able to entertain most people, even if the experience is not always smooth sailing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As most modes split players into teams, they could technically qualify as co-op since members will likely need to work as a unit to have a chance of victory. Slayer, Oddball, Capture the Flag, and Fiesta are all solid modes. However, for a more conventional cooperative option, there is Firefight: King of the Hill, which pits a team of four against waves of AI enemies that gradually get harder. Currently, this mode has three starting difficulty levels (Normal, Heroic, and Legendary), allowing a group of players to pick the one that best suits their experience. Firefight includes 15 maps, which tend to get updated fairly frequently.

  Thetgamecompany achieved something special with
  <em>
   Journey
  </em>
  , including one of the most memorable co-op in gaming.
  <em>
   Sky: Children of the Light
  </em>
  builds on the same idea of naturally encountering other players while exploring a beautiful world, presented through the structure of an MMO. Now, that genre tends to be associated with quests, guilds, and large-scale boss battles, all things that are largely absent in this indie title. Rather,
  <em>
   Sky: Children of the Light
  </em>
  prioritizes carefree exploration and small unique experiences that blossom out of seemingly random encounters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite coming to Steam in 2024,
  <em>
   Sky: Children of the Light
  </em>
  has been available in some form for years; consequently, it is hardly a new project. That said, there is nothing else quite like it on Valve's platform. While it might struggle to keep a group of players coming back for months on end,
  <em>

  can be a great palate cleanser between more action-oriented titles.

  isn’t exactly known for horror games. That’s probably the last thing that comes to mind. In fact, players can probably count all of their horror titles on one hand. But that doesn’t mean the publisher hasn’t delivered a few experiences chilling enough to keep players up at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sure, some of these may not reach the sheer terror that certain Japanese developers have mastered, but they’re still enough to leave players in a cold sweat or reach for the nearest light switch. So, let’s take a look at some of the
  <strong>
   most terrifying experiences Ubisoft has delivered over the years, either as a developer or a publisher
  </strong>
  .

  players might scoff at the idea of this being included on this list. But those who’ve spent enough time in the sewers beneath Washington, D.C., know exactly why. Every now and then (thanks to the game’s randomized encounters), players will cross paths with a nomadic, eerily silent faction known only as the Underground.
 </p>
 <p>
  These mysterious sewer-dwellers are clad in all black with heads wrapped in chains. But what truly pushes them into pants-pooping territory? Their chainsaw-wielding tanks. The moment that engine roars to life, all player strategy will evaporate, leaving behind a bawling mess.

  For a series about serial murderers who stab people for a living, Assassin’s Creed is surprisingly light on horror. It leans more toward quasi-historical action romps with a swashbuckling feel. But all of that got tossed out the window (and into a bale of hay) with the release of
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Syndicate’s Jack the Ripper
  </em>
  DLC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting hunted by the Whitechapel Murderer was a thrilling yet terrifying experience that fans of the franchise won’t soon forget. But the biggest chill of all? Stepping into the shoes of the Ripper himself.

  isn’t exactly billed as a horror game, but it will definitely get players' hearts racing as they navigate its bleak, uncaring world. Like all post-apocalyptic survival stories, the biggest monsters aren’t the environment or dwindling resources—it’s people. People who will do anything to survive, or even worse, those who revel in lawlessness now that society’s rules no longer apply.
 </p>
 <p>
  This one isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s far more focused on dealing with emotional gut punches than physical ones. So, it's not the best choice to unwind with after a rough day.

  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  was a hugely ambitious game for Ubisoft. They wanted to cement it as one of the all-time greats of the open-world genre. While it’s debatable whether or not they met that lofty goal, the game did have some standout moments.
 </p>
 <p>
  One such moment was “Alone,” a minigame from
  <em>
   Watch Dogs’
  </em>
  selection of Digital Trips. This eerie scenario dropped Aiden into a nightmarish,
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  -esque version of Chicago, forcing him to stealthily evade waves of relentless killer robots. The suffocating atmosphere, oppressive darkness, and downright chilling sound design make it an experience that lingers long after the trip is over.

  Whether it’s morally bankrupt villains or bad acid trips, the

   Far Cry

  series isn’t afraid to dip its toes into horror. And one of the places it leans into it most is its DLCs—especially in

  Ubisoft took the
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  series in a much edgier direction with its fifth installment, giving it a radical tonal shift that wouldn't feel out of place in a survival horror game. Up until this point, the series had been fairly light-hearted, but the developer wanted something grittier and darker.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result? An almost unrecognizable Prince who ditched his Aladdin-style garb for a more angsty, gothic look. But the real nightmare came in the form of a brand-new villain—the Dahaka. This relentless force of nature hounds players throughout the game, backed by pounding metal music, and there’s not a single thing they can do but run and hide.

  <em>
   Cold Fear
  </em>
  is one of the few ventures Ubisoft made into the survival horror genre. In the game, players must fight against infected enemies known as "Exos," who are the unfortunate hosts to parasitic organisms known as the "Exocel." If that sounds very similar to
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , that’s because it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  What
  <em>
   Cold Fear
  </em>
  did bring to the table was its claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of disorientation from being on a ship amidst a storm. Players would need to compensate for the rolling of the ship as they fought for their lives, making every encounter in the first half of the story especially tense. It’s too bad the rest of the game pales in comparison.

  When thinking of the Wii U, horror isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind. However, Nintendo attempted to change that perception with
  <em>
   ZombiU
  </em>
  , a first-person survival horror game developed by Ubisoft. Tasked with crafting an experience that would appeal to a more mature audience, they delivered a game full of tense, terrifying moments.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   ZombiU’s
  </em>
  most unsettling mechanics was its use of permadeath. Every zombie encounter carried serious weight, as death meant losing your character as well as any progress they had made. Adding to the panic-inducing atmosphere was the Wii U GamePad, which displayed crucial inventory and map information, forcing players to constantly dart their eyes between screens, often at the worst possible moments.

  <strong>
   Melinoë must cast an Incantation at the Cauldron in the Crossroads to unlock familiars.
  </strong>
  Specifically, the player will need the
  <strong>
   Faith of Familiar Spirits incantation
  </strong>
  . To unlock this incantation, players must prioritize each gathering equipment and use it at least twice. Once that's done, Melinoe has to defeat Hecate. If done correctly, Hecate will have a dialogue with Melinoe before the fight about familiars.
 </p>
 <p>
  After returning to the Crossroads, interact with the pot to find the incantation. To cast this incantation, Melinoe will need
  <strong>
   2x Nectar
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   1x Lotus Flower
  </strong>
  . To find Nectar, look for rooms that have the Nectar symbol on them, or purchase it for 50 bones from the Wretched Broker. Lotus flowers are found in various rooms throughout Oceanus. After casting
  <strong>
   Faith of Familiar Spirits
  </strong>
  , Melinoe will receive 1 Witch's Delight. Give this treat to an animal, and they will join Melinoe in her future runs as a familiar.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Hades 2,
  </em>
  players have 5 animal companions to choose from - Frinos, Toula, Raki, Hecuba, and Gale. Each one represents a different material Melinoe can gather during her adventures in the Underworld or the Surface. As a result, choosing the best familiar to go after a specific material will not only increase the probability of that material appearing, but it will also
  <strong>
   circumvent the need to play a minigame in order to gather that material.
  </strong>
  For example, Toula makes fishing easier and more likely to appear. If Melinoe fishes while Toula is with her, then Toula will automatically catch the fish instead of having the player go through the minigame.

  Frinos can be found near Melinoe's tent. Not only can he boost Melinoe's maximum HP, but he can also be used to block projectiles. This is particularly useful against Hecate since Frinos can eat the polymorphing curse.

  After casting the Woodsy Lifespring Incantation, Melinoe will encounter Toula in the fountain room of Erebus. After interacting with her, Toula will disappear from Erebus and reappear later on the Surface.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Start a surface run, defeat Polyphemus in Ephyra, and head into the Pier area.
  </strong>
  Before jumping through the exit, keep an eye out for Toula on the far left side of the pier. Give her a Witch's Delight and she'll join Melinoe as a familiar.

  Raki can be found in the
  <strong>
   fountain room of the Crossroads
  </strong>
  . Head past the fountain, and there will be a white raven to the left of the path just before the exits. The first time Melinoe talks to Raki will make Raki disappear.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that run, jump into another Underworld run until Melinoe comes across the
  <strong>
   fountain room in Erebus
  </strong>
  with Raki in it. Raki will disappear one more time after Melinoe interacts with it. In the next Underworld run, find the fountain room one more time in Erebus, and Raki will have the option to bond with Melinoe. Give the adorable white raven a Witch's Delight, and it'll join Melinoe as a familiar.

  To find Hecuba, head to the Underworld and

   find Echo in the Fields of Mourning
  </strong>
  . Follow the road toward the exit, and Hecuba will sometimes be waiting near the exit doors. Be careful not to miss the adorable canine — her black fur makes her blend into the floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Talk to Hecuba, and she'll disappear. Repeat this process and level up the other familiars at the Crossroads until Hecate has an exclamation mark over her head. Speak to the Titaness, and she'll allow the recruitment of her familiars — Hecuba and Gale — through the "
  <strong>
   Shared Familiar Bonds
  </strong>
  " permission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jump into one more Underworld run, find Hecuba again in the Fields of Mourning, and this time, Melinoe will have the option to
  <strong>
   give Hecuba a treat
  </strong>
  . Give the faithful hound a Witch's Delight, and she'll join Melinoe as a familiar.

  To recruit Gale, you will need to make sure you've completed both the
  <strong>
   Faith of Familial Spirits
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Shared Familiar Bonds
  </strong>
  incantations. Players returning to the game for the
  <strong>
   Warsong Update
  </strong>
  will most likely already have these completed, as they are required to recruit all previous animal familiars.
 </p>
 <p>
  To
  <strong>
   find Gale the Poelcat in
   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  you'll need to begin a surface run. Gale is located in the final chamber before reaching
  <strong>
   Prometheus
  </strong>
  . This means you'll need to complete the City of Ephyra and the Rift of Thessaly, then scale the lower levels of Mount Olympus. When you reach the end of Mount Olympus, you'll find Gale in the same chamber as the shop, on the right of the path just before the door to Prometheus.
 </p>
 <p>
  We were not able to recruit Gale the first time we encountered him. We spoke to the polecat, then they disappeared. However, we were able to recruit Gale with a treat the second time we encountered them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gale's main ability is blocking attacks, then immediately retaliating with a scratch attack. It appears that Gale will block a certain number of attacks per encounter, though it is hard to tell which attacks specifically will be blocked. As we learn more about the mechanics, we will add our findings here.

     We recruited Gale with a returning save file, having progressed through all available content up to the Warsong Update. We are currently checking to see if there are any differences when starting from the beginning with a new save file. While there likely won't be, should any arise, we will include them here as soon as possible.

  To upgrade a familiar, approach it in the Crossroads. To upgrade the familiar traveling with Melinoe, head over to that familiar's spot in the training area and tell it to rest. From there, give the familiar a Witch's Delight to upgrade one of its skills to the next rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  To craft more Witch's Delight, use the
  <strong>
   Beast-Loved Morsel Alchemy recipe
  </strong>
  at the Cauldron. This recipe can be used once Melinoe has cast the Faith of Familiar Spirits incantation. The ingredient that may be a little difficult to find is the Star Dust. To get it, cast the
  <strong>
   Abyssal Night Incantation
  </strong>
  , which can be obtained from Chaos at the Crossroads near the Pitch-Block Stone. Alternatively, Star Dust can be obtained by completing Chaos Trials, or purchased from the Broker for 600 Bones.

  War serves as the backdrop for many games because it immerses players in intense action both on and off the battlefield. However, there are also games that focus on
  <strong>
   post-war
  </strong>
  struggles, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects through the characters, locations, and storylines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many games are centered around the consequences of war, whether based on real conflicts or fictional ones. In contrast, some games incorporate war as a background element within their lore, allowing players to discover details as they explore various locations or receive information during gameplay.

  Fearing communism after World War 2, the underwater city of Rapture was created to be a haven. However, utopian societies never last and
  <strong>
   <em>
    BioShock
   </em>
  </strong>
  showcases that by showcasing Rapture through the eyes of someone trying to survive the genetically modified denizens of the city who have devolved into insanity after a civil war inside the underwater city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  a beautifully crafted retro-futuristic world that can be as mesmerizing as it is terrifying. The first-person shooter game earned praise for its memorable gameplay, including the use of superpowers, puzzles, and a unique atmosphere. This resulted in
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  becoming a beloved trilogy of games.

  While not a major part of the story in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </strong>
  </em>
  , it is said via dialogue that Night City and the rest of country are still suffering in the aftermath of a devastating civil war. The Unification War was only the latest of several wars across the decades, including the Fourth Corporate War and Night City became a beacon of peace despite numerous criminal activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The neon colors and fantastical technology in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  are always matched with a sense of everyone and everything being worn down. It adds to the world as the player explores Night City as the cybernetically enhanced V. The result is a well-made glimpse of a dark future and an RPG that dramatically improved over the years after a controversial launch.

  The death and destruction of the First World War combined with the rise of influenza resulted in a vampire plague in London. In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Vampyr
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the player controls a doctor named Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has returned to England from the war and has become a vampire, allowing him to be the ultimate hero or villain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vampyr can best be described as
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  for vampire fans, with dialogue and story decisions that can drastically alter the story. It is also an RPG where the player can level up Jonathan Reid to have a plethora of powerful vampiric abilities, such as blood constructs, enhanced speed, and rapid regeneration.

  All Fallout games take place after the nuclear devastation of what is known as the Great War.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place earliest in the official timeline, only twenty-five years after the bombs fell and the wastelands of West Virginia are still fresh with newly formed monsters, bandits, and other threats to fight either solo or with friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Fallout 76 was initially an undercooked game with many glitches and felt incomplete, consistent updates have allowed the game to make a turnaround. Now Fallout 76 provides a fun MMO experience that rivals
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  , with plenty of content that can have players roaming the wasteland for hours with no end in sight.

  The franchise that helped revolutionize first-person shooters was rebooted with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wolfenstein: The New Order
   </em>
  </strong>
  , featuring B.J. Blazkowicz on a new adventure fighting the Nazis. However, the twist is that in this timeline, the Nazis won World War 2 thanks to their technological advancements and have turned most of the Earth into their cold and steel empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alternate history concept of
  <em>
   Wolfenstein: The New Order
  </em>
  breathed new life into the long-running franchise, with adrenaline-pumping gameplay that makes the player feel Captain America but with an R-rating. From dual-wielding massive weapons to brutally massacring legions of evil fascists, the reboot checked off all the right boxes, thus leading to two sequels and a prequel.

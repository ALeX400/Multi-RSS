  Mitch and Stan are two of the many NPCs you run into in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Road 96
   </strong>
  </em>
  , and the Thieves in The Temple chapter is where they teach you how to lockpick. Lockpicking is one of the most useful skills in the game, but this chapter can also be difficult to get through as it can possibly end with your arrest.

  Essentially, they need your help to break into the Happy Taxi Headquarters and find out more information on Sonya Sanchez's potential killer. You'll need to head into the security room and ensure that they find their way around, but if you make the wrong choices, you could find yourself in cuffs by the end of the chapter. Here's how you can avoid arrest and unlock the secret safe in the security room.

  Thieves in the Temple starts with you happening upon the Happy Taxi Headquarters in
  <em>
   Road 96
  </em>
  and seeing Stan and Mitch outside the door looking for a way in. You just need to walk up to them, and they'll ask if you want to be part of something big. Say yes, and they'll lead you to the back where you need to break in and crawl through a vent into the security room. This is also the point where you'll learn the lockpicking ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you enter the room, Stan and Mitch will tell you to sit down and look at the security cameras to help them around the building. Before you take a seat, check for a Sonya Scratch card underneath the desk which you can pick up for a chance to win some extra cash. Once you're done, sit down in front of the cameras to start the chapter proper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stan and Mitch will ask if they can see you, and then they'll ask if you can tell them where exactly they are in the building. To check, you need to match the camera they appear on with the room map on the wall directly to your left. Once you've checked it, you'll find that they're standing in Reception. Immediately after you tell them, though, an alarm will go off which you need to try and disable. To switch the alarm off, you can look at the pad with different colored numbers on your right and push the blue button to switch it off.

 <p>
  Shortly after the alarm goes off, the phone will start ringing. Before you pick it up, just let Stan and Mitch know that you've got it. When you pick up the phone, the security will ask if everything is alright. Make sure you tell them that it was just a false alarm and that it was either set off by a cat climbing through the window or that you went to the bathroom and forgot about the alarm setting. She'll thank you for your explanation, and then ask you for the security code.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll need to ask Stan and Mitch for their help in this section of the phone call. Just follow the conversation prompts that direct the two criminals to find it somewhere in Reception. They'll eventually find it, and the correct answer is
  <strong>
   A45 D2R CPP12
  </strong>
  . Once you've given the code, security will finally hang up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, Stan and Mitch will move to the next room and find a door which requires a code to open. You'll need to look in the desk drawer furthest from you to find the code, which is
  <strong>
   4707
  </strong>
  . Once they're inside, they'll find what they've been looking for. However, pretty soon after they share this information with you, security will barge in, and you'll have to choose between giving them the code or not.

  If you choose to give security the code, then Stan and Mitch won't have time to find the location of where Sonya's killer is planning to attack. Thankfully, though, they won't get caught by the police and this is also the safest route to make sure that you don't get caught either. However, if you don't give the code to security, Stan and Mitch will be able to find the killer's attack location, and you'll have a 60-second timer to climb back out through the vent. In both cases, you just need to grab the chair you were sitting on and use it to climb out of the vent again, and the chapter is finished.

  When you first enter the security room, you may have noticed a door to your immediate right which contains a safe that you can open. If you have the hacking ability, you should be able to open it immediately, but otherwise, you'll need to wait until you've helped Stan and Mitch to get the code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on your choices, you may only have 60 seconds to find the safe code and open it before grabbing the chair and getting out through the vent. If this timer runs out, then you will get arrested. You can find the safe code on the right side drawer of the desk where the security cameras are located, but if you're a bit too stressed out to look for it, it's
  <strong>
   2237
  </strong>
  . If you chose to betray them, though, then there won't be a timer and you can take your time to open the safe. There's some cash and a cassette tape inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're looking for an alternate way out, then you can also look in the left-side drawer of the desk to find car keys. Once you exit through the vent, you'll be home-free and back on your way to the border on

      <title>What to Expect from Everhood 2</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/everhood-2-what-to-expect-indie-rpg-rhythm-game/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Everhood 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is Foreign Gnomes' sophomore release, chasing its 2021 predecessor. A decidedly
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  -influenced game,
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  plays with Toby Fox's unmistakable styles of art and comedy, infusing them with a unique flair through several impactful means, not the least of which being a vibrant and cathartic rhythm-based combat framework. With an injection of classic RPG mechanics and a healthy dose of gameplay variety,
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  has proven to be one of the most fascinating indies of the last few years.

  </div>

 <p>
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  's follow-up, slated to release this March, is seeking to further iterate upon the powerful premise of its progenitor, with the same psychedelic art style and emphasis on fast-paced gameplay blended with RPG fundamentals. Perhaps the greatest strength of the first
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  is its raw originality: though the comparisons to games like
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  are understandable, and even useful for the purposes of a shorthand description, they aren't sufficient for covering the game's strengths and pure imagination.
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  may not be able to recapture the same sense of surprise as the first game, but it can certainly build on its foundations in refreshing and unexpected ways, and that's exactly what it seems to be doing.

  Everhood 2: An Overview
 </h3>
 <p>
  Equal parts spiritual journey and epic adventure,
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  tasks players with defeating a Mind Dragon and discovering the "color of [their] soul." Players will make their way through various environments, interact with NPCs, and collect gear in a fashion that should be familiar to RPG fans. LIke
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  , battles in
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  eschew traditional mechanics like turn-based combat or hack-and-slash controls in favor of a rhythm-based format similar to the likes of
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  , though even this has its own unique twists, with the focus being on avoiding notes rather than hitting them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from battles, the first
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  features a number of rhythm-based puzzles, which shake up the moment-to-moment gameplay. All of these mechanical intricacies are couched within a psychedelic and heady narrative that explores themes like the nature of humanity. One can expect all of these points to make their return in
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  , even though the sequel's plot and gameplay particulars are relatively obfuscated.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-everhood-2-is-doing-things-differently">
  How Everhood 2 Is Doing Things Differently
 </h3>
 <p>
  Based on the information currently available, it looks like
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  will reward aggressive playstyles a bit more than its predecessor; players will ostensibly have access to some kind of parry ability, encouraging a more active approach to battles.
  <em>
   Everhood
  </em>
  does offer offensive abilities, but only after a few hours into the game. The prominence of this parry ability in
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  's promotional footage suggests that such maneuvers will have a greater focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, one can expect the high falutin themes of the first game to make a return in
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  , but the adventure will apparently be longer this time around: Foreign Gnomes has described the length of
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  's campaign as being between 8 and 10 hours, whereas the first game was marketed as being about 5 to 6 hours long. The game's Steam page also states that it will have over 100 songs to engage with, indicating a beefy single-player experience indeed. Beyond that, features like the Custom Battle Editor will be making a return, offering theoretically endless gameplay for dedicated players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall,
  <em>
   Everhood 2
  </em>
  is shaping up to be a meaningful and intriguing continuation of the first game's strengths, with more narrative and gameplay content that will hopefully strike a balance between refreshing and familiar. Time will tell if it lives up to its predecessor's reputation, but it is certainly looking promising so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Everhood 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  releases March 4, 2025 for PC.

  With Act 3 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Episode Revenant, the Kell's Fall exotic mission has been released, and with it comes the Slayer's Fang exotic shotgun. Thanks to this latest addition, there are now 8 exotic shotguns in the game, each holding a unique place in players' arsenals. Each gun in this category has a specific use case, from the Lord of Wolves with its absurd solar bursts to the Tractor Cannon with its weakening spread.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is a look at
  <strong>
   each of the exotic shotguns in
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , ranking them with a focus on their power in PvE content. Some of the shotguns are predominantly PvP powerhouses, but this doesn't factor into their ranking. As such, some fan favorites may end up lower than expected.

   Lord of Wolves
  </span>
  was an absolute PvP monster for some time, able to consistently melt opponents with ease before Bungie addressed its power and brought it back in line with the competition. Now, thanks to the time it takes to fire a full burst, the Lord of Wolves has been left behind, feeling underwhelming in both PvP and PvE.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is difficult to recommend using Lord of Wolves in any content. Despite its decent damage output, it struggles with its ammo economy and doesn't put out enough damage to warrant using it over any other options in the exotic shotguns category.

   The Chaperone
  </span>
  is yet again a gun that has ruled the PvP landscape but has never made any particular waves in the PvE meta. The gun fires a single precision slug, which is no longer a unique selling point, making it difficult to use in content where the player is overwhelmed by enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the precision damage The Chaperone does is powerful, its precision requirements make it a detriment to most players trying to use it. Outside of having an impressive one-shot-kill range in PvP, there is little to compliment regarding this gun.

   Duality
  </span>
  offers the player the precision damage of The Chaperone along with the ability to fire a standard spread shot while firing from the hip. Duality is another weapon that thrives in PvP; however, thanks to its exotic perk, there is an argument to be made for its use in PvE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Duality has the perk "On Black Wings," which allows for stacking precision damage and reload speed buffs obtained when getting kills with the pellet spread firing mode. This is a fun shotgun to use in lower-tier content, but it can struggle in endgame content thanks to requiring kills to activate its full potential.

   Legend of Acrius
  </span>
  was one of the first exotic shotguns in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and is now one of two remaining in the heavy weapon slot. Firing a large arc shock wave, Legend of Acrius can hit any enemy with an unbeatable amount of damage per shot. If a raid boss can be approached safely, there is an argument to be made for a team using this gun to clear it.
 </p>
 <p>
  With its exotic catalyst, Legend of Acrius has increased magazine and inventory sizes, as well as access to the perk "Trench Barrel," which pumps up the damage even further for three shots after hitting an enemy with a melee attack, making this gun even more powerful.

   The Fourth Horseman
  </span>
  is one of the most ridiculous weapons in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , firing faster than most players can handle. Holding down the trigger will unleash the entire magazine in a matter of seconds, with each subsequent hit increasing the damage of the succeeding shot. If an enemy is close and has a very short damage period, this gun is one of the easiest ways to pump out absurd damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not usable in the majority of content, The Fourth Horseman is unquestionably fun and able to destroy most enemies if the player can get into melee range. The main issue that this gun will run into is ammo, burning through all of its reserves at lightning-fast speeds, but with the right build, it can easily be useful in a variety of content.

   Tractor Cannon
  </span>
  is not a damage dealer or ad-clearing machine. Rather, this shotgun is a support weapon, sacrificing one player's damage output to greatly bolster the damage of the rest of the team. While it is no longer as powerful as it once was, Tractor Cannon was a must-have for any raid group.

 <p>
  Even now, if a player wants to support their team or is facing boss mechanics that don't allow them to damage effectively, this gun is the perfect option to simply help their fellow gamers deal extra damage for very little input.

  As the latest addition to the exotic shotgun list, Slayer's Fang has not quite found its place in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  yet. Despite this, it is easily one of the strongest options for endgame content, with its built-in champion stunning capabilities and free void weaken. Unlike all the other guns in the exotic shotgun category, Slayer's Fang is craftable, offering not only a curated experience for each player but also allowing for the choice of four exotic catalyst perks.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a player wants greater damage output, they can use "Cascade Point," or if they would prefer survivability, they can take "Repulsor Brace." There is no real right choice. While it may take some getting used to, thanks to its unique firing style, if a player can grapple the Slayer's Fang, they'll do well in even the hardest content.

   Conditional Finality

  is a powerhouse in both PvE and PvP, able to freeze and ignite targets with a single magazine. While this gun does require the player to get very close to the enemy, there is no real danger thanks to its ability to instantly freeze any target.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only downside to this gun is its method of acquisition, being available a random drop from the final boss of the Root of Nightmares Raid. Outside of this, it is a gun that many players have struggled to put down from the moment they got it, and it is arguably the most versatile weapon in
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  , boasting incredible damage potential, subclass synergies, and champion stunning capabilities.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan crafted a pixel-art map of Japan and highlighted where some game regions would fit, based on official information from each title. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cartographer was complimented for spotlighting the main series and some entries from fan-favorite side games on their virtual map of Japan.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the first to the fourth
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game generations, the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions were based on different Japanese locations, albeit with some directional changes. In
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  , the tropical Hoenn region was derived from Japan's Kyushu region, though Hoenn's map was flipped 90 degrees counterclockwise. Since the launch of
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White
  </em>
  , the vast
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  universe has seen trainers explore regions based on other countries, like the US and France. The Paldea region of
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  drew inspiration from the Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Portugal.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Reddit user named kyuweftea shared a pixel-art map of Japan in the world of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  on the r/pokemon subreddit. Though it is an unofficial map, kyuweftea used the art style of
  <em>
   Pokemon Diamond and Pearl
  </em>
  as the basis for their handiwork. Kanto and Johto were placed toward the center of the map, where Tokyo and Kyoto would be, with the Sevii Islands of
  <em>
   Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen
  </em>
  placed over the Izu and Bonin Islands to the south. Along with Hoenn and Sinnoh being direct parallels to Kyushu and Hokkaido respectively, kyuweftea's map also included the regions of Fiore, Almia, and Oblivia from the
  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger
  </em>
  side-series. Fiore and Oblivia were plotted to the west of Johto, and Almia was located southwest of Sinnoh. Originally released in 2006,
  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger
  </em>
  took advantage of the DS touchscreen control to give players a different way to capture Pokemon for various missions.

  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia
  </em>
  and 2010's
  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger: Guardian Signs.
  </em>
  In response to kyuweftea's cartography, Pokemon fans thanked them for remembering the
  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger
  </em>
  games. Other fans also pointed out that the Kitakami region from
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask
  </em>
  was based on a real-world Japanese city of the same name.

  Given that the real Kitakami is located in the Honshu region to the south of Hokkaido, that would put The Teal Mask's Kitakami between Kanto and Sinnoh, based on the established parallels. Though the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will take players back to Lumiose City in Kalos, it remains to be seen where future
  <em>
   Pokemon

  generations will take trainers next.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has pointed out a problem with the game's current Legendary Flight event and its connected Timed Research, and they're furious about it. It seems they're not the only one, as other
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players have shared similar frustrations.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  can be played anytime, but the game offers plenty of benefits for specific events and research. These instances tend to be time-limited, so if a player doesn't participate in time, the opportunity is simply lost. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Max Particles system has left several players angry about how the ongoing Legendary Flight event has been set up.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player Adorable_Fuel_9478 took to the title's subreddit to complain about the current Max Monday event and its Lead-Up Timed Research. At the moment in the game,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  is highlighting each of the three legendary birds in Max Battles at Power Spots. It's a good opportunity to fight and capture the Pokemon, adding it to the roster of battle Pokemon that players can then engage in even more Max Battles with. However, there's a problem. Max Battles require spending Max Particles, and so did the Lead-Up Timed Research for Dynamax Articuno, as it tasked players with upgrading Max Moves 3 times, using up particles in the process. After leveling up Max Moves to work on the research, the player realized that they no longer had enough to participate in the actual Max Battle, with the two sharing an expiration date.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <h2 id="pokemon-go-players-resent-max-particle-limits">
  Pokemon GO Players Resent Max Particle Limits
 </h2>
 <p>
  The main problem here is that the number of Max Particles a player can earn per day is limited, leaving them with no other alternative than spending real world money to buy more in the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  shop. While Dynamax Articuno still has a chance of appearing at Power Spots for the remainder of the week, it's no longer guaranteed, and this may also make it more difficult to find partners to battle in the 5-star Max Battle with. Players who don't want - or can't - spend real-world cash may find themselves trapped between completing the Timed Research or participating in the actual single-day Max Battle.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  While having to manage one's Max Particles to access everything would be frustrating enough on its own, the main issue players take with it is that the game feels like it's pushing players into spending real money. Many players have become more frustrated with the microtransaction system in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Going forward, players who are looking forward to the Max Battles with Dynamax Zapdos and Dynamax Moltres will want to keep these limits in mind and act carefully.

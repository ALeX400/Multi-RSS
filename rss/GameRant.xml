  Thursday, September 26 will be a big day for
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise, as that's the day that not only
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  hits store shelves, but a special
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  -themed Switch Lite console does as well.
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  has been one of Nintendo's biggest franchises for decades, with each new entry consistently earning critical acclaim and selling millions of copies.

 <p>
  Considering how popular the franchise is, it's really no surprise that
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  has had an incredible presence on the Switch. Nintendo has made an effort to bring classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games to the Switch Online subscription service, and it has also released multiple new
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games on the platform, ranging from remakes of classic titles like
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  to brand-new, open world epics like launch title
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and its beloved sequel
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . The next big
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  adventure is coming on September 26, a day that will be particularly exciting for longtime franchise fans.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is the first main series
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game that will feature Zelda as the predominant playable character.
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  will see Princess Zelda explore Hyrule, utilizing a unique ability that lets her copy enemies and objects and then use them in battles, puzzle-solving, and exploration. Featuring an art style similar to the gorgeous
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  remake,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has looked incredible so far. But while
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is the main reason why
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans should circle September 26 on their calendars, it's not the only reason they should be excited about that day.

  The same day that

  </em>
  hits store shelves, Nintendo will be releasing a special
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  -themed Switch Lite console. The
  <em>

  -themed Switch Lite, known as the console's Hyrule Edition, is gold with the Triforce symbol on the bottom right-hand corner of the device. The rear of the system is adorned with the Hylian Crest, making it a snazzy collector's item for
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans, even if they already have a Switch console handy.

  <em>

  </em>
  games, including some of the absolute best games the series has produced so far. With a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership,
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans can play classics like
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , so they should be kept plenty busy, to say the least.

      PS Plus subscribers will get free games in September 2024, and games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, Death's Door, and Hogwarts Legacy would make great additions.

     <li>
      Dragon Age: Inquisition would fuel hype for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Death's Door offers Zelda-like gameplay, and Hogwarts Legacy would be a great counterpart to Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions.

  <strong>
   PS Plus
  </strong>
  subscribers get several free games every month to add to their libraries, meaning more are on the way in September. One PS Plus Essential game,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , has already been confirmed for September 2024, but there are a few others that would do well for the month.

 <p>
  There are a handful of games that would make great additions to PS Plus in September 2024 in light of current trends and upcoming titles. Subscribers will need to wait until August 28 to see the official PS Plus lineup for September 2024, but until then, it's worth speculating about which games they might be.

  With the recent announcement that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will be launching on October 31, 2024, there arguably isn't a better time for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  to be added to PS Plus. This would give players plenty of time to experience the most recent
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game before the next one releases, which is especially important considering both Varric and Lace Harding are returning as companions in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  follows the story of the player character, the Inquisitor, as they attempt to resolve the civil unrest in Thedas and close a massive tear in the sky known as the "Breach."

  <em>
   Death's Door
  </em>
  would make a unique addition to September 2024's PS Plus Essential lineup, as it plays similarly to classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is launching on Switch near the end of September. While
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  is owned by Nintendo,
  <em>
   Death's Door
  </em>
  is one of the closest things those without a Nintendo Switch will get to the beloved franchise on PlayStation.
  <em>
   Death's Door
  </em>
  is a 2021 isometric action-adventure game by Acid Nerve and Devolver Digital, in which players take on the role of a "reaper" collecting souls for the Reaping Commission Headquarters​​​​​​.

  While
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is already confirmed for a PS Plus Essential release in September, it might be a good move to add
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  to PS Plus along with it.
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is one of the best-selling games of all time, as it gives players an adventure through the Wizarding World like no other game before it. However,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  lacks Quidditch, likely due to the fact that there were plans to eventually release
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  . Nevertheless,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is an adventure worth having for
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  fans and non-fans alike.

    PS5:
    <em>
     The Plucky Squire

   is already set to debut on PS Plus Extra and Premium on September 17, 2024, so it automatically takes the PS5 spot for next month.

    PS4:
   </strong>
   With
   <em>
    S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
   </em>
   just around the corner, there wouldn't be a better time for the first game,
   <strong>
    <em>
     S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl
    </em>
   </strong>
   , to take PS Plus Extra's PS4 spot for September 2024.

  As captivating as it is,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a pretty demanding game that can strain even high-end systems. For players with lower-spec hardware, this can lead to frustrating performance issues and constant crashes. Recognizing this, Game Science has thoughtfully included a
  <strong>
   Compatibility Mode
  </strong>
  designed to optimize the game for less powerful PCs. This feature allows players to enjoy the game's breathtaking world and thrilling combat without sacrificing too much visual detail.

  <em>

  players can find a Compatibility Mode in the PC version of the game when they first launch it. This mode improves the game’s performance by disabling certain features, making sure that it runs smoothly even on machines that might struggle to handle the full experience.

  While this can help prevent glitches and improve stability, it may also introduce trade-offs, such as V-Sync being enabled, which causes frame rate drops. Nonetheless,

  Compatibility Mode offers a viable solution for those who want to enjoy the game on older or less powerful PCs.

     When launching the game for the first time, it's highly recommended to play without activating Compatibility Mode. This allows you to experience the game in its intended state and assess whether you encounter any performance issues that might require the mode. It’s possible that your PC can handle the game without any adjustments. But if you do face any issues, like stuttering, black screen, or crashes, Compatibility Mode can be a helpful solution.

  <strong>
   Mobile games
  </strong>
  are an entertaining medium, expertly designed to make people even more addicted to their phones. The mixture of simple "grab and go" gameplay (which the intricacies of certain apps may limit) alongside their continually expanding nature, makes them a fun endeavor to sink a few hours of time into at sporadic intervals. Even discounting this design element, mobile games boast their fair share of issues.

 <p>
  The chief issue among them is that many continually-updating games have a limited run, after which they are promptly deleted. Beyond the natural sadness one might feel when something they invest time (and possibly even money) into suddenly stops, it also becomes upsetting when a fun game is no longer available for regular play.

   Here are some truly entertaining mobile games that are no longer available for regular play

  <em>
   <strong>
    Infinity Blade
   </strong>
  </em>
  was once one of the fastest-growing action RPGs, raking in over a million dollars less than a week after its release. The game involved the player character fighting a number of gigantic enemies, taking them out by swiping their fingers across the phone to trigger the player's sword. The game has a cyclical narrative structure revolving around the nameless player character and their bloodline in continual conflict with the immortal god-king.

  later received a pair of sequels and even a pair of tie-in novels, which were set in between its various games. Unfortunately, the entire trilogy was removed from the App Store in 2018, with the developers citing difficulty updating the game to function on modern hardware. Due to Epic Games' developer account on Apple being terminated, it is now even unavailable for download through purchase history, making it truly inaccessible.

   <em>
    Farmville
   </em>
  </strong>
  was, for better or for worse, seminal in the development and progression of mobile games. This game has the player completing various tasks that come with farm management.
  <em>
   Farmville
  </em>
  helped popularize a kind of gameplay echoed by many mobile and flash games today, which also consist of the player managing and developing businesses. It even received a pair of sequels, which are still available for the time being.

  <em>
   Farmville
  </em>
  was shut down at the tail end of 2020 due to Facebook discontinuing its support for flash games. This was influenced by a decision Adobe made to stop updating and distributing Flash Player.
  <em>
   Farmville
  </em>
  was far from the only casualty of this decision, as it sparked a shockwave of flash games that became unplayable due to the sudden discontinuation, unless they were backed up to a point where the now dead browser extension was no longer needed. Fortunately, for those interested,
  <em>
   Farmville 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  , the latter of which was released after the shutdown of the original, are still available.

  This puzzle game, released in 2020, was shut down nearly two years after its release. It was a matching game, in the vein of other App Store releases such as
  <em>
   Candy Crush
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Royal Match
  </em>
  , but with
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  characters and a few gacha elements. The player could swap bonbons, little chibi-like icons of characters' heads, in order to clear a grid, in ways connected to the greater narrative of
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  . Characters ranging from the Straw Hat Pirates to all of their enemies, as well as a number of characters less represented in the games, such as Boodle and Chou Chou, were all playable in this minimal capacity.

 <p>
  Individual characters could level up and gain stronger skills as a result, often facing off against larger foes who would make matching more difficult. The series managed to progress up to the first half of the Dressrosa Saga in terms of its levels, but was shut down shortly afterward. As of the time of writing, there are still two games based on the series being supported and updated:
  <em>
   Bounty Rush
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragalia Lost
   </em>
  </strong>
  was developed by Cygames and published by Nintendo, making it the latter company's first IP to launch first on mobile. It takes place in a kingdom where humans and dragons co-exist, often forming pacts with one another for the sake of sharing their power.

 <p>
  Using touchscreen controls, the game relied on rapid-fire action and had a robust cast of characters, also achieving crossovers with various other series such as
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Heroes
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mega Man
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, even after grossing millions, the game was shut down shortly after its main campaign was completed. It was available for only five years. Despite this, it managed to acquire a loyal (if not substantial) fanbase, with many hoping Nintendo will somehow revive the series in the coming years.

  This tower defense game was a sequel to a previous game,
  <em>
   Metal Slug Defense
  </em>
  . While that game focused near-exclusively on the main series characters, with little in terms of deviation,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Slug Attack
   </em>
  </strong>
  instead veered wholly in another direction. It instead produced alot of fascinating, albeit occasionally jarring, powerful new characters to expand the lore of the series.

 <p>
  These characters tended to divert from the original artstyle, for a more anime-esque feel than the
  <em>
   Metal Slug
  </em>
  games of old, and were introduced alongside a number of modified versions of weapons from the games. However, it was not without its problems. A notable issue was the power creep introduced alongside many updates, with the newest character effectively overshadowing the majority of the other characters.

  Despite the app ceasing operations in 2023, a re-release was made available on most modern consoles in 2024 as
  <em>
   Metal Slug Attack: Reloaded
  </em>
  for the relatively low price of $10. However, due to an effort to balance out certain characters, large amounts of the original roster were not translated to the game, despite assets representing them (such as potential player icons) making an appearance in various bits of the game, leaving certain fans wishing for some form of update that would make the game playable in its complete form.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </strong>
  </em>
  tells a story between grand exploits of the usually epic space opera. Some aspects of the open-world adventure are even being compared to
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  , and it's understandable why Massive Entertainment's upcoming title is one of the most highly anticipated games of the year with what it promises, as well as the level of detail put into it thanks to Lucasfilm's assistance. Fans are no longer dreaming of using the Force and are more than happy to pick up a blaster in the criminal underbelly of a galaxy far, far away.

  In
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  , fans get to live out the adventure of Kay Vess in between
  <em>
   The Empire Strikes Back
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Return of the Jedi
  </em>
  . It's Kay's (and of course the player's) decisions that influence what reputation she has as a scoundrel, too. Game Rant recently got to speak with numerous members of Massive Entertainment's development team about
  <em>
   Outlaws
  </em>
  , the immersion that the backdrop of the movies gives to the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe, and what role Expert NPCs play.

  ' dev team adores the universe the game takes place in. As a result, it's a big goal of the team to make the world come alive in front of players and add depth down on the ground compared to the story found in the movies. In order to help with that,
  <em>
   Outlaws
  </em>
  looks to NPCs to help unlock specific aspects of the game.

 <p>
  Rather than allowing players to get new equipment and abilities as a reward for simple progression, Massive wanted these unlocks to be adventures in themselves, which game director Mathias Karlson says was the decision behind the game's "Expert" NPCs. The director went on to say that each Expert is "a gateway to a number of unlocks," but players need to find them first and what exactly it'll take to get what they offer will be a surprise—a mini-adventure on a larger scale story.

   "The fact that every unlock has a unique set of requirements means that you keep arming yourself with different goals and ways to engage with the game and the world. For example, one unlock asks you to jump your speeder 60 meters without crashing, and suddenly you find yourself looking at the world around you like a motocross park, in search of the biggest jumps."

 <p>
  Karlson didn't state if these expert NPCs would be influenced by Kay's reputation or not. However,
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  may be designed to avoid locking these NPCs behind any sort of walls along the way by the nature of the same system. Karlson states that adding a reputation system to
  <em>
   Outlaws
  </em>
  felt as natural to it as the Wanted System with threats such as the Empire hanging over players' heads.

 <p>
  To him, the reputation system was "the key" to making
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  into a real outlaw fantasy in the iconic universe. Similarly to the quests with expert NPCs, though, the consequences are important, but the actions are even more so:

  <p>
   "A very important aspect of its design is that you are never stuck, and you don’t have to stick with one specific syndicate. You will definitely be able to gain an excellent reputation with each syndicate at some point in your journey through the game — just not with all of them at the same time. They don’t like each other… so, what is appreciated by one is often frowned upon by another, presenting you as a player with lots of fun A/B choice moments."

 <p>
  Even as players find themselves backed against the wall with a particular faction, they can easily play the favor of another syndicate to get out of the situation and progress further again if they desire it. The idea of this truly makes
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  indeed feel like a proper scoundrel fantasy, with Kay Vess likely able to "talk her way out of it," hopefully a bit like Han Solo getting stuck between the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub.

 <p>
  It says quite a lot about
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  ' player freedom which makes the upcoming open-world game all the more exciting and impressive. Players can plan ahead for their playthroughs, but these dynamic systems may make it more fun to make decisions on the fly.

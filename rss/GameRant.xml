   Digimon Story
  </em>
  RPG series,
  <em>
   Time Stranger

  <em>
   Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Time Stranger
  </em>
  will feature turn-based RPG combat and monster-taming that will give players the means to befriend and battle all kinds of new and classic Digital Monsters.
 </p>
 <p>

  remains light at the time of writing,
  <em>

  </em>
  fans will soon get a chance to learn more. According to the official

  <em>
   <strong>
    Deltarune
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Toby Fox has provided a new update regarding Chapters 3 and 4 of the episodic RPG, which are both scheduled to be released sometime in 2025. As Chapter 2 was released over three years ago, fans are eager to get their hands on the next pieces of
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  to continue Kris, Susie, and Ralsei's story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Featuring similar gameplay to Fox's acclaimed 2015 title
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  's story will span seven chapters in total, with Chapters 1 and 2 released in 2018 and 2021, respectively. The available entries have been applauded by players and critics alike for their sense of humor, characters, and soundtrack, the latter of which was also composed by Fox. In December 2024, the developer stated that
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  Chapters 3 and 4 were nearly complete, though the bug-testing phase and translation phases would take some time. Regardless, fans are gearing up for a 2025 launch, with a new update from Fox helping to temper expectations regarding an exact release window.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a new BlueSky post, Fox offered some details about the current status of
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  Chapters 3 and 4, confirming that console testing is still underway. While the developer notes that there are fewer bugs than before, there is still a lot of content to test, and the PlayStation 5 version has yet to be tested at all. Additionally, the team needs to ensure that save files from the demo carry over to the main title on consoles, which has only just become possible. While this may sound like bad news at first glance, Fox previously stated that
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  Chapters 3 and 4 would "100% come out in 2025."

  Toby Fox Still Aiming to Release Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 in 2025
 </h2>
 <p>
  In July 2024, Fox announced that Chapter 4 was fully playable, though some polish was still needed. Both new chapters will be released at the same time across all platforms, marking a major change, as both Chapters 1 and 2 of
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  were first released for PC before being ported to consoles. Chapter 5 is currently in production, with Fox confirming in December 2024 that progress was "steady" on all fronts.

  While
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  has been well received by players, its popularity hasn't yet swelled to the level of
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  , which continues to inspire fans nearly a decade after its release. The 2015 game's unique approach to battle, in which players can choose to resolve enemy encounters peacefully, carried over to
  <em>
   Deltarune
  </em>
  , and fans are eager to see if any other aspects of Fox's magnum opus will appear in the forthcoming entries to his current RPG project.

  <strong>
   GameStop
  </strong>
  is currently hosting a Buy 2 Get 1 Free sale for PlayStation 4 games. This is an excellent opportunity for PS4 or PS5 owners to acquire new games at GameStop at excellent prices, but it’s important to note that, as usual, only pre-owned games are available for this promotion, rather than brand-new copies.
 </p>
 <p>
  GameStop is currently the largest video game retailer in the United States. The company is known for its frequent Buy 2 Get 1 Free game promotions, which allow customers to purchase three games for the price of two.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, GameStop has announced the return of the popular Buy 2 Get 1 Free game sale, but this time only for used PS4 discs. As usual, only the cheapest of the three games purchased will be free, so consumers should keep that in mind. Gamers will have a wide range of titles to choose from, as there are 1,672 games included in the sale. Some of these titles include widely popular PS4 games such as 2018’s
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , Grand Theft Auto 5
  <em>
   , Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Uncharted 4: Thief’s End
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  . Obviously, these are only some of the many titles available in the promotion. While these games can also be run on the PS5, it’s important to note that they will not run as native PS5 titles, though.

  At the moment, it’s unclear how long the deal will last, as GameStop generally does not disclose this information. In any case, GameStop customers would be wise to purchase their desired products as soon as possible to avoid losing the chance of saving money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite offering these excellent promotions, GameStop continues to close down physical stores in the United States. Last month, GameStop silently closed multiple stores, disappointing some regular customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year, GameStop also left Germany, reducing its overall presence in Europe. Before stopping all the activities, the number of stores in the country had already decreased from 200 to around 70. Fortunately, the company’s online presence continues to be strong, and sales such as the current Buy 2 Get 1 Free promotion are still important for gamers who want to save when acquiring physical media.

      <title>Honkai: Star Rail - Every God and Hero From Greek Mythology Referenced in Amphoreus So Far</title>

   <em>

  ’s third update introduced the new planet Amphoreus. This new planet is filled with references to Greek and Roman mythology, from its name to its characters and beyond. But these references aren’t just specifically mentioning Greek and Roman gods and heroes,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  ’s new planet has a distinctly Grecian feel to its design. Nevertheless, with Greek mythology’s gods and heroes making such an immense impact throughout pop culture, it's no surprise that Amphoreus is filled with many references to these mighty warriors.

     In order to keep this article on the shorter side, this article defines a reference to a hero or god from Greek or Roman mythology when the name of that god or hero is mentioned. This narrows the pool of references as several of Amphoreus’ characters seem to pay homage to Greek and Roman gods or heroes without using the same names. Additionally, references to monsters, philosophers, and Greece and Rome’s many key historical players are excluded from this article.

 <p>
  Amphoreus has over eighty NPCs and that number will keep climbing as future updates for the new planet are already scheduled. Yet, some of these NPCs have more bearing on
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  than others.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the smaller NPCs have big names to look up to. For example, Daidalos, the Chief Engineer of Kremnos Arena, is briefly mentioned in the Arena Maintenance Log. His name is a clear reference to Daedalus, one of the most famous engineers in Greek mythology and the creator of the Minotaur’s Labyrinth and father to Icarus. Daidalos’ name is proof of how dedicated to immersive storytelling HoYoverse is. This character has only shown up by name so far in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , yet this naming choice is immediately revealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other small-time NPCs that players actually interact with feature some of the most recognizable names from Greek and Roman myths. Characters like Gaia, Peleus, Cassondra, and Iason practically have the same names as the Greek gods and heroes they are referencing. Gaia is clearly based on Mother Earth, Peleus is named after the father of Achilles, Cassondra, who acts as a fortune-teller in Janusopolis, is a reference to the Oracle Cassandra, and Iason is only one letter away from the hero, Jason. Iason notably names the dromases after other Greek myths, with their names being Asterion, Euphemus, Castor and Pollux, and Heracles.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a few names that partially obscure the characters they are referencing, like Demetria, Apollonia, Aphrea, and Ulixes.
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  players caught up on their Greek mythology will know that Demetria and Apollonia are references to the Greek gods Demeter and Apollo respectively. However, Ulixes is the Latin form of “Ulysses”, another name for the Greek hero Odysseus. Aphrea is also a tricky situation. While Aphrea sounds similar to Aphrodite, the link that clearly binds the Greek goddess of love to Aphrea is the character’s marriage to Vulcan, which is the Roman title for Hephaestus. Aphrodite and Hephaestus are married, confirming that Aphrea was named after the love goddess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Roman mythology has its fair share of NPC references as well. NPCs Bacchus and Fortuna are both named after Roman gods. Bacchus is the Roman form of the Grecian Dionysus and Fortuna is the Roman goddess of luck. However, one of the more important NPCs in Amphoreus’ storyline is based on a Grecian character. Elder Caenis of the Council of Elders seems to be modeled after Caeneus.

 <p>
  Amphoreus’ many titans also clearly reference Greek and Roman mythology. Titans like Thanatos, Mnestia, and Zagreus all directly reference Greek gods with their names. Thanatos is the Greek personification of death, a fitting name for the Death Titan. Mnestia and Zagreus are more obscure references. Mnestia is likely derived from Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, and Zagreus seems to be an Orphic version of Dionysus. These names are fitting for Titans that represent romance and trickery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Titans Cerces and Oronyx, who could possibly be one of the Chrysos Heirs, could be referencing Greek gods and heroes in their names as well. Cerces sounds similar to Circe, a sorceress that has appeared in several adventures, most notably the Odyssey. Oronyx seems to refer to the goddess of night, Nyx. Considering the Titan’s tie to Evernight, this reference seems logical.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Kephale has the most obvious reference to a character from Greek mythology despite not sharing a name. The Titan Father of Amphoreus is shown holding up the sky, a direct reference to Atlas. Missing Kephale on this list would be lunacy despite the fact that he technically does not fit the guidelines set at the beginning of this article.

 <p>
  The Chrysos Heirs are arguably the most notable characters in Amphoreus, as they will allegedly all be playable characters. Aglaea, who was introduced to
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  in Version 3.0, was the first Chrysos Heir to join the game. She shares her name with one of the Greek charities. Mydeimos, who will be joining in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.1, seems to share a name with Deimos, the Greek god of terror and son of Aphrodite and Ares. This name is fitting considering that Deimos takes the Path of Destruction and seeks the Coreflame of Strife.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two unreleased and alleged Chrysos Heirs also reference Greek mythology. Hyacine, who is currently an NPC but was confirmed as a Chrysos Heir in the Golden Epic trailer, could be directly referencing Hyacinth. This tragic character was the lover of Apollo before he was struck down by a jealous former lover. Phainon shares a similar role to Hyacine, as he has been confirmed to be a Chrysos Heir in the Golden Epic trailer but is currently an NPC. His name could be a reference to Phaenon, a sky god specifically of the star Cronus.
 </p>
 <p>
  HoYoverse has also referred to Greek and Roman heroes and gods through the names of locations, specifically Janusopolis. This name is derived from Janus, the Roman god of doorways, which perfectly suits the City of the Thousand Gates. Janus is also referred to in Amphoreus’ history as the Passage Titan. Even readables have received the reference treatment, with the “Dromas Herakles’ Twelve Trails” being available for players in the Grove of Epiphany. These constant references show how dedicated
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is to Amphoreus’ theming. Future versions will surely uncover more references to Greek and Roman gods and heroes.

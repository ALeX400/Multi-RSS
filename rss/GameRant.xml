  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  won't appear at
  <strong>
   Gamescom 2024
  </strong>
  , an event representative has confirmed. While Team Cherry fans will hardly be happy with this omission,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  skipping Gamescom is far from surprising, as the game has been MIA for a while now.

 <p>
  First announced in February 2019,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  was originally envisioned as
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  DLC before the rapidly increasing scope of the project prompted Team Cherry to turn it into a standalone game. Since then, the developer announced that the much-anticipated metroidvania will be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release and confirmed its plans to bring it to the latest two generations of PlayStation consoles. And while it was previously targeting a release in the first half of 2023, the company indefinitely delayed
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  in May of that year.

  Hollow Knight: Silksong Skipping Gamescom 2024
 </h2>
 <p>
  Ever since then, fans have been speculating about the possibility of
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  appearing at pretty much every major event that came and went in the meantime. Looking to get ahead of such chatter this time around, long-time Gamescom presenter Geoff Keighley has recently taken to Twitter to state that the
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  sequel will be skipping this year's edition of the show because Team Cherry "is still cooking." The move marks the second occasion on which Keighley tempered Gamescom expectations over the past 12 months, having also done so ahead of the 2023 edition of the convention.

  As for Team Cherry's highly anticipated title,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  has already disappointed fans several times this year, one for each of the early summer game showcases that took place in June 2024. The lack of updates about the project's status has long been memed in the online community, which has been waiting for
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  for over half a decade as of this writing.

  An incredibly lucky
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has crafted the Harlequin Crest after several attempts.
  <em>
   Diablo 4

 <p>
  These are the Mythic Uniques, formerly known as Uber Uniques, which are among the most powerful items in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . There are currently eight Mythic Uniques in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , and the player who is lucky enough to get one will have an item with 925 power and the highest affix values possible. To grab one of these formidable pieces of gear, players can fight Tormented Bosses, defeat monsters from level 55 onwards, or gather
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's materials to craft them. And thanks to this system, a
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  player now has one of the game's most powerful items.

  Reddit user matt303277 is the latest
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  player to own a Harlequin Crest, this time gotten via crafting. They explained that they had been trying to get a Harlequin Crest with the Greater Affix of cooldown reduction "for a while," but without success. The player finally finished the quest for their Shako recently, obtaining the popular
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  item with an impressive 30% cooldown reduction. Other equally huge stats of the Mythic Unique item include 2,775 maximum life and 3,750 armor. By comparison, some of the item's base stats grant 1,850 maximum health and 2,500 armor.

  In the race to obtain Mythic Uniques, the Harlequin Crest is a popular choice among players. Considered one of the best Uniques in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , Shako is a general Mythic Unique item, meaning that players can equip the item regardless of the class they are playing. Previously, to use the Harlequin Crest,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players had to be level 35, a restriction removed after the item's rework. With the rework, Shako has become even more coveted because, coupled with the Greater Affix and Masterworking upgrades, players can achieve a whopping 54% cooldown reduction.

  The Harlequin Crest remains one of

  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  revamped all Unique items, including Mythic Uniques, spicing up the gameplay experience. For those who have yet to obtain Shako or another of these important items, players have discovered a new method of farming Mythics in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  that could prove useful.

 <p>
  The isekai genre, often associated with anime, involves characters being transported to unknown realities where they face new challenges and opportunities. In RPGs, many titles adopt a similar dynamic, taking protagonists to other realms and requiring them to adapt to new rules and explore unfamiliar environments.

 <p>
  Despite many of these games not adopting the typical anime aesthetics, several RPGs still capture the essence of isekai, utilizing this narrative to tell deep and immersive stories. These games challenge characters to adapt to new realities, offering unique and thrilling experiences that transcend the boundaries of the known.

  The
  <em>

  franchise already flirts with isekai elements, transporting characters to supernatural worlds. In
  <em>
   Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth

  , these themes are intensified, bringing together protagonists from different games in the series in a new universe. Although they already possess powers, the heroes must adapt and join forces to face the challenges of this cinematic labyrinth.

  In this spinoff for the Nintendo 3DS, players explore dungeons inspired by films, each with its own rules and dangers. The narrative, lighter than in the main games, highlights the interaction between iconic characters from different

  eras as they face new enemies and unravel the mysteries of this alternate universe.

  Inspired by games like
  <em>
   Earthbound
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is one of the simplest and most enjoyable RPGs ever developed, where the protagonist, a child, falls into an underground hole filled with monsters and must adapt to this reality. The game also incorporates many popular elements from the isekai genre, forcing players to adapt to the rules of this new world.

  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  offers an engaging narrative with complex characters, where choices and approaches result in different endings. The game subverts expectations by introducing mechanics that encourage peaceful alternatives to combat, challenging the player to adapt to an unknown world. This combination makes
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  a modern example of isekai, shaping the protagonist's experience.

  In
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  , Sora is whisked away from his island home, becoming separated from his friends as he's thrust into new worlds inspired by Disney stories. Each world presents its own unique rules and challenges, emphasizing the isekai element as Sora adapts to these unfamiliar realities, often feeling like a "fish out of water" in these strange, magical lands.

 <p>
  As the game progresses, however, the script lessens the need for adaptation, with Sora navigating the worlds without needing to follow specific rules. Despite this change, the first
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  still fits well within the isekai concept, with its initial premise and the constant sense of being in an unknown environment, maintaining the spirit of an adventure RPG.

  <em>
   Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
  </em>
  wasn't the only time the franchise played with isekai elements, and in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Arceus
  </em>
  , the main characters are sent to the past by the God of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  himself. Although his motivations are unclear, the journey to the Hisui region is both fun and one of the best spinoffs in the series.

 <p>
  Here, players are transported to a region in the past, where
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  were still more of a threat than a friend. Even the
  <em>
   Pokedex
  </em>
  , for example, had not been fully developed. In this game, which combines RPG elements with exploration, players must shape the future of the universe as it is known today.

  <em>
   Digimon
  </em>
  is one of the franchises that best knows how to use standard isekai elements to create high-quality animations and RPG games, and in
  <em>
   Digimon Survive
  </em>
  , the story is no different, making it one of the best games in the franchise. Here, the game features tactical battles, but the majority of the gameplay focuses on text in a Visual Novel style.

  Many universes created in video games are often perilous for their inhabitants, filled with dangers that many players have wondered what it would be like to live in these fantastical worlds. This is the theme of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
  </em>
  , where the protagonist, Marche, is transported from everyday life to the magical world of Ivalice. Inspired by a game he and his friends are familiar with, the world turns out to be more challenging than expected.

 <p>
  In Ivalice, Marche faces challenges beyond battles, dealing with the moral complexities of a seemingly perfect world but filled with hidden dangers. The game incorporates isekai elements, emphasizing the character's adaptation to new rules and the quest to return to the real world, while Marche learns about friendship and responsibility.

  Even though the main games in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise follow the logic where players are trainers battling in gyms, the spinoffs explore more creative narratives.
  <em>
   Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
  </em>
  does this by taking characters on an isekai journey. Here, the human protagonist is transformed into a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , embarking on a new and challenging adventure.

 <p>
  In this new world, the protagonist must adapt to life as a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , forming teams with other creatures to explore mysterious dungeons and face various dangers. The plot explores the adaptation to a new reality, with the protagonist learning to live in this universe while seeking answers about their transformation and how to return to human form.

  The
  <strong>
   Game Boy Advance
  </strong>
  was an amazing little handheld that was a vast improvement over the original Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. It boasted a bigger screen, better graphics, colors, and sound, and it was a huge success story for the Nintendo brand.

  Unfortunately, many of the games in the GBA's vast library aren't playable on modern consoles, but thanks to emulators on the
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  , you can play your favorite games on Valve's powerful handheld. This guide will detail how to install EmuDeck, install the GBA games, and add them to the Steam Deck's library along with your official Steam games.

 <p>
  If you want Emulation Station to list your games with their boxart and metadata within the UI so they look more organized and presentable, use the following steps to change the presentation:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":361} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Open the Nintendo Game Boy Advance menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Press the Steam Deck's menu button - above the right analog stick.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select
   <strong>
    Scraper.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   For Scrape From, select
   <strong>
    TheGamesDB.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   In Scrape These Systems,
   <strong>
    Select Game Boy Advance.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Select Back.
  </li>
  <li>
   Open
   <strong>
    Content Settings
   </strong>
   and switch on Game Names, Other Metadata, Screenshot Images, Title Screen Images, Box Cover Images, Box Back Cover Images, and Marquee Wheel Images.
  </li>
  <li>
   Then select Back and Start on the next screen.
  </li>
  <li>
   Depending on how many games you have in your library, it may take some time to pull in all the required data.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now you can navigate your game library through Emulation Station complete with box art and metadata.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1028} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  That's everything needed to play Game Boy Advance games using the Steam Deck's main library or through Emulation Station's built-in UI. It's surprising how visually impressive GBA titles look with a fantastic library of RPGs and adventure games that stand the test of time.

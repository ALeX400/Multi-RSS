      A Black Ops 6 player hit round 200 in the Liberty Falls spawn room, unlocking no doors and using no Gobblegum.
     </li>
     <li>
      Utilizing new omni-movement, the player strategically defeated enemies without leaving the starting area.

     <li>
      The player used only a DMR wall gun, knives, the Combat Axe, and various perks to reach level 200.

  Since its release, many gamers have been exploring
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies game modes. Going beyond the Multiplayer and Campaign, Zombies offers many unique ways to kill its variety of enemies by using the new omni-movement system.
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  has also been adjusted to reflect the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  gameplay changes, including this mobility improvement. Using omni-movement, players can slide or dive in any direction while continuing to fire their weapons. One player has gotten to round 200 of Zombies' Liberty Falls without moving around the map or acquiring an optimal loadout.

    What Do You Think Of The New Content In Black Ops 6 Season 1?

   <p class="display-card-excerpt">
    It's a pretty healthy content drop. The new weapons feel great, the maps flow smoothly, and while that Citadel map for Zombies isn't out yet, I'm very excited for it. I'm still not a fan of the funky fantasy skins, but I guess cosmetics like those are to be expected from Call of Duty nowadays.

  Reddit user Iron_DVS recently shared a clip highlighting the moment they reached round 200 in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Liberty Falls Zombies map. The video begins with the player using an armor plate before killing a Mauler with their Combat Axe. The gamer then rotates toward the motel before turning to throw two more axes at one remaining Mauler, the second of which is ignored by the enemy as it prepares an attack. After collecting the thrown axes, the player kills the last Mauler and reaches level 200. They then reveal that the first door was never opened before saving and quitting. The final scoreboard shows that the Reddit user earned 14,999 eliminations, 1,092 critical kills, achieved 1,438,435 total essence, and used zero door buys and revives.

  Iron_DVS concluded this portion of their match with nearly eight hours of game time spent entirely in the spawn room. As indicated by their title, they will seemingly continue progressing through the rounds even after hitting 200. They only used the DMR wall gun, opting for a deadly knife and Combat Ax combination. According to the player, they burned through Juggernog and Quick Revive and used the spawn room trap whenever possible. They utilized the Chopper Gunner and Mangler Injection to defeat Abominations and survived "scary" situations using the Aether Shroud

  Field Upgrade. Gamers trying to replicate this experience will also need to hit Liberty Falls' vending machine every round to get rare perks and the possibility of a Ray Gun.

 <p>
  Compared to other
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies locations that offer small spawn areas, Liberty Falls provides an open intro area that offers players plenty of space to kite zombies around. This allows players like Iron_DVS to reach level 200 without leaving the spawn room or abusing exploits. As Treyarch is set to add more
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies maps, this may be something that can also be done in future content.

 <p>
  Just like most other video games,
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  has placement limits. These limits are put in place to help keep people from accidentally putting things in areas that are out of bounds.
  <strong>
   The Place Anywhere mod removes pretty much all of these restrictions,
  </strong>
  allowing players to put down items wherever they please.

 <p>
  This is mostly used for stacking and placing items closer together than is normally possible. It's a popular mod among those who like to organize things in nice piles. It's also quite fun mod for those who like testing the limits of the game by placing large amounts of stock in one place.

  <strong>
   Courseplay
  </strong>
  is a mod that overhauls how AI workers operate. Instead of having to allocate jobs one at a time and plan each route individually, players can now take automation to a new level.
  <strong>
   This mod removes a lot of the boring aspects of the game and allows the player to sit back and relax while their workers do their thing.

  Players can use the Courseplay mod to set up automatic workflows for plowing and cultivating land, planting crops, selling crops, and a whole lot more.

 <p>
  For all its merits, certain aspects of
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  can feel a little repetitive after a while. The constant process of plowing, cultivating, planting, fertilizing, and harvesting can definitely get a bit tedious over time.
  <strong>
   This mod allows players to set up a convoy of machines to work in unison.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1034} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  This mod can be used for everything from gathering large harvests using a convoy of harvesters to using multiple machines to make the silage process much faster. While it can take a little while to set things up, it does make completing large jobs much easier.

  Heading back to the farmhouse to get some sleep can get a bit annoying after a while. While players can work through the night, it's often much easier to get some shut-eye and get work done during the day.
  <strong>
   This mod allows players to sleep anywhere they like by pressing the keys Control, Alt, and Z.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Sleep Anywhere mod
  </strong>
  helps players stay focused on the task at hand and allows them to get back to work immediately after waking up. It's the perfect mod to use for all players who value efficiency above everything else.

  Driving around heavy equipment or getting slow-moving machinery from one place to another can be a time-consuming task.
  <strong>
   The Super Strength mod

  turns the player into a lifting machine.

   When activated, this mod allows players to lift everything with ease.

 <p>
  Players can lift, move, and place everything from pallets and farming equipment to huge machines such as harvesters and tractors. While it's not ideal for those who are looking for an immersive experience, it's the perfect mod for those who want to skip out on some of the more slow and tedious aspects of the game.

  The easiest way to make money in
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  is to cheat.
  <strong>
   This mod allows players to build their farms much faster than normal thanks to some financial support.
  </strong>
  There are two types of subsidies in the game:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":283} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Government Subsidized - Awards the player between $4,800,000 and $48,000,000 in income each year.
  </li>
  <li>
   Subsidized By Local Municipality - Awards the player between $48,000 and $480,000 in income each year.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":487} -->
 <p>
  It's important to note that the financial benefits can only be awarded to the player in sunny weather. That said, it's an easy mod to install, and it is perfect for those who just want to drive around and use the most expensive machinery in the game.

  Just like its predecessors,
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  has a few issues with camera angles. It's not uncommon for players to find themselves getting stuck with a jittery camera while trying to drive along roads and through fields.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  <strong>
   This small but handy mod fixes the majority of the issues surrounding camera angles, allowing players to enjoy a smoother playthrough.
  </strong>
  While it's not as big as many of the other mods on this list, it does bring a quality-of-life boost to
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  that makes a big difference to the overall feel of the game.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </em>
   ,
  </strong>
  artifacts are essential components that significantly enhance character abilities, providing bonuses and other advantages that ensure the survival of those who explore the Zone. These powerful items, however, carry adverse effects like radiation, requiring careful handling to optimize their use.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The best artifacts for
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  combine substantial benefits with the inherent risks of radiation, allowing stalkers to face the most intense challenges more efficiently. Proper selection of these artifacts is crucial to balance the advantages gained with the need to mitigate negative effects, thus guaranteeing superior performance during incursions into the Zone.

 <p>
  One of the best artifacts that players can find in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  , and which will be considerably useful during the first hours of the game, is the Wrenched. This artifact is quite common and obtained in gravitational anomalies. The item is capable of
  <strong>
   protecting the protagonist from bullets
  </strong>
  , and although it doesn't reduce damage significantly, it's enough to ease the initial hours of exploration through the Zone.

 <p>
  Furthermore, the item doesn't increase the radiation suffered by the character much, making it an artifact that can complement the inventory well when the player is unsure about which equipment to use. Considering that fighting mutants and other humans is one of the main activities in the game, it ends up being a consistent choice.

  Managing the inventory is one of the mechanics that players must master early in the game. If it gets full, the protagonist receives some debuffs, such as reduced stamina and speed. However, for players who want more space in their backpack, the Spring is one of the best artifacts to have in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In exchange for increasing the radiation suffered by the character, this equipment, which can be found in gravitational anomalies, also
  <strong>
   increases the capacity of items the player can carry in their inventory.
  </strong>
  This ends up being a fair or even quite beneficial trade-off if the player knows how to control radiation levels. Therefore, taking advantage of this extra space in the backpack to carry some extra doses of vodka is also a good choice.

  Most of the legendary artifacts in
  <em>
   STALKER 2

  have the drawback that, when equipped, they significantly increase the radiation suffered by the character. However, in return, they offer powerful bonuses. Therefore, players must keep their artifact slots balanced between those that provide radiation protection and others with buffs.

 <p>
  The Hypercube is one of the items that grants great buffs. When equipped, it offers
  <strong>
   maximum bleeding resistance and thermal protection.
  </strong>
  This makes it one of the best artifacts in the game, especially against mutants or other attacks that usually cause the bleeding effect. However, it requires a certain balance to avoid slowly killing the player.

  Although many artifacts found in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  increase the radiation suffered by characters, there are some rare exceptions that do not grant this effect and even help the protagonist deal with this negative effect. Therefore, having a Bubble among one's equipment is a smart choice for those who explore the Zone.

 <p>
  The item can usually be found in the game's Acid Anomalies. It allows the player to equip other artifacts that grant great benefits but also have side effects. Furthermore, the Bubble is ideal for exploring dangerous areas, r
  <strong>
   educing damage caused by contaminated environments
  </strong>
  and ensuring a greater chance of survival in these moments.

  The Weird Flower is a unique artifact in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  , known for its peculiar effect that benefits strategic players. When sleeping with this item equipped, its special fragrance
  <strong>
   reduces the chance of being detected by enemies.
  </strong>
  This effect is more powerful right after waking up, but gradually diminishes over time.

 <p>
  Besides its functional effect, the Weird Flower is often described as one of the legendary "altered items," so for players who like collecting, it's an important artifact to always have nearby. With its specific impact on gameplay, this item is an excellent choice for those who prefer to avoid direct confrontations during explorations.

 <p>
  The Liquid Rock is a perfect artifact for
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  players who wish to explore the most radioactive areas of the game, or even use other artifacts that increase radiation but also wish to suffer fewer adverse effects because of it. Thus, it is also one of the best items geared towards character protection.

 <p>
  Although rare, the item can be found in Acid Anomalies, and players who find it can consider themselves lucky. This is because, in addition to offering
  <strong>
   maximum protection against radioactivity and chemicals
  </strong>
  , the item also has a very high value among traders. It can be sold to buy other equipment if it doesn't fit the player's build.

 <p>
  The Compass is an extremely powerful artifact in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  , providing
  <strong>
   maximum physical protection
  </strong>
  at the cost of maximum radiation exposure. This makes it a double-edged sword; while it offers unparalleled defense against physical attacks, it significantly increases the radiation the character suffers. Thus, it requires careful management to mitigate its adverse effects.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1155} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Due to its rarity and the high risk associated with its use, the Compass is best suited for experienced players who have the means to handle high radiation levels. It is a strategic choice for those who need maximum protection in the most dangerous areas of the Zone, but it's essential to balance its benefits with adequate radiation countermeasures.

  In addition to artifacts that can be found abundantly in different places on the map,
  <em>
   STALKER 2

  also contains unique variations, usually with special effects that can grant different abilities to the player. This is the case with the Weird Ball, which can be found inside the Bulba anomaly, to the right of Zalissya.

  The positive point of this item is that it
  <strong>
   reduces the damage from possible shots
  </strong>
  that the protagonist may receive,
  <strong>
   as long as the player remains stationary.
  </strong>
  It is a condition that can limit some builds, but for characters who like to fight at long range with rifles, it is a guarantee that even if an enemy's shot hits them, the injuries caused are reduced. This makes the Weird Ball one of the best artifacts for the early game.

  The
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  series started life over two decades ago as a one-on-one fighting game, but developers Omega Force quickly opted for a more hack-and-slash style in the sequel, and they never looked back. Its Japanese title is where the term 'Musou' comes from, meaning unrivaled, and has become synonymous with the overall genre.
  <strong>
   Musou games
  </strong>
  are known for their large-scale battles, fast-paced action, and array of playable characters.

 <p>
  Several other franchises have already gotten involved. The likes of
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   One Piece: Pirate Warriors
  </em>
  series have all achieved critical and commercial success, rivaling even that of
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  , so there is no reason to doubt that
  <strong>
   other franchises may be looking to branch out in this direction and try a Musou spin-off of their own.

  A franchise that is not afraid of a spin-off, and certainly not afraid of adapting,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  seems to be the most requested franchise for a Musou game. It's not unrealistic either, since developers Square Enix have previously seen their
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series get a Musou makeover.

 <p>
  The combat system has already been real-time action for a few entries in the mainline series now, not that turn-based combat can't be transitioned to a Musou game, as
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Warriors
  </em>
  proved. The roster of characters from three decades of games is huge and the possibilities for settings, stories, and weaponry are incredible.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
   </strong>
  </em>
  have been a pillar of the beat-em-up genre of video games, even rivaling classic series like
  <em>
   Double Dragon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Streets of Rage
  </em>
  . The bright color palette and unique premise really lend itself well to these sorts of games.

 <p>
  Swapping between the four main turtles and beating up Shredder's ninja army 'The Foot' on the streets of New York City would be perfect for a Musou game. Each member of the reptilian gang has their own unique weapon, opening the door for different playstyles and tactics.

  Nothing could replicate the true Jedi or Sith experience like a swarm of enemies acting as fodder while players slash through them with lightsabers and Force powers. Across the many films, TV series, books and other media, the lore of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars
   </em>
  </strong>
  is rich with eras, characters, and a multitude of planets to battle on.

 <p>
  Imagine storming the front lines during the Clone Wars, helping to take down the Empire, or even going back to be part of the formation of the Sith. Using Darth Maul and his iconic dual-blade lightsaber or dual-wielding lightsabers as Ahsoka Tano would really make players feel God-like in a Musou game.

  A one-on-one fighting game receiving the Musou treatment is not unheard of, since that is exactly how

  started its life. Of the many options from the fighting genre,
  <strong>
   <em>
    SoulCalibur
   </em>
  </strong>
  seems the most obvious choice, since weapon-based offense is already a major part of the series.

 <p>
  The gameplay mechanics are already there, with ridiculous combos inflicting high levels of damage on enemies. The only difference is that hordes of grunts on an open battlefield need to be added. The story is already there too, with a gripping good vs. evil plot involving the legendary swords Soul Calibur and Soul Edge.

  Many fans would argue that the classic movie tie-in games for
  <em>
   The Two Towers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Return of the King
  </em>
  were similar to Musou games themselves. While aspects of them may be outdated today, they are still a fantastic building block to go all out on a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lord of the Rings
   </em>
  </strong>
  , or even a wider
  <em>
   Middle-earth
  </em>
  , Musou game.

  There are many Ages in the lore of Middle-earth that could be utilized, each with its own interesting battles, characters, and locations. Recent related media such as the
  <em>
   Hobbit
  </em>
  films,
  <em>
   The Rings of Power
  </em>
  TV series, and a
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  expansion show that there is still an appetite for this thriving franchise.

  Another franchise not afraid to branch out,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  has seen many mainline titles and countless spin-offs. There are now over one thousand unique Pokemon, coming in all shapes and sizes with different attacks depending on their type.

 <p>
  Developers Game Freak would have to come up with a somewhat creative reason for large-scale battles involving everyone's favorite monsters, but surely it would be something involving a dastardly plan from the evil Team Rocket. The interesting movesets could provide a new style of Musou game, moving away from melee combat and into more elemental and magical attacks.

  A smash hit that has outperformed its indie credentials, this franchise may seem like an odd choice at first glance. Lending from the rich mythology of Ancient Greece, there are myriad characters to choose from, such as the Olympic Gods, Titans, and other deities, as well as mortal heroes like Ajax or Patroclus.

  The fact that the characters Shulk, Pyra, and Mythra have now appeared in the
  <em>

  <em>
   ,

  and that there are references to
  <em>
   Xenoblade

  in

  means that fan appeal for this sort of crossover exists. Wielding Shulk's powerful sword Monado in the various unique settings and fighting the Mechon, among others, would be spectacular.

  Kratos is renowned for his rampages through waves of enemies, so a Musou game involving him seems very obvious. The original games in the
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  series were completely immersed in the Ancient Greek pantheon, and with more recent entries borrowing from the Norse Gods, there are plenty of options for enemies and settings.

  Attacks are varied in the current games thanks to the large arsenal of their Spartan protagonist, and whipping up a tornado of humanity with the Chains of Olympus seems like a perfect fit for a Musou game. Plus, the bosses are some of the best battles in this genre, and what could be better than the Greek Titans and Norse Gods?

  The Italian plumber is not averse to a spin-off game, even some that were unexpected. Nobody could have predicted that an
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  -style turn-based strategy game would work with Mario and friends, but along came
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids
  </em>
  , and it was received very positively, even being creative with some game mechanics, as we so often see in the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  series.

  It's been an exciting debut year for
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , as the game has established itself in the live-service RPG genre and been nominated for The Game Awards for Best Mobile Game. Since its release in May 2024,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has added 25 Resonators to its playable roster, the latest being Camellya in Version 1.4. As confirmed by developer Kuro Games, Version 1.4 is the last patch set in the Huanglong region. Once the update wraps up, fans will travel to Rinascita, the second nation in Solaris-3 launching in Version 2.0. Rinascita has barely been mentioned in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  ' lore, but fans will soon begin to know more about its characters, as the first Rinascita unit joining the game has been revealed.

  has introduced Carlotta, the first 5-star Resonator hailing from Rinascita expected to debut in Version 2.0. Per her official character description, Carlotta is the second daughter of the Montelli family of Rinascita and comes from a noble background. Carlotta recently appeared in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  ' first official Rinascita trailer, along with another new Resonator named Roccia. Although Kuro Games has not confirmed her weapon type, Carlotta's official art sees her holding a gun, so players suspect she might be a Pistols wielder.

  Being the first Rinascita character to have a confirmed five-star rarity, Carlotta's banner will likely feature in the first half of Version 2.0. However, through previous social media posts,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has already teased several Rinascita characters that will appear in upcoming updates. Aside from Carlotta, other potential future Resonators are Zani, Roccia, Brant, and Phoebe. It won't be long before Carlotta and others make their debut, though, as Version 2.0 releases on January 2. On the same date,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  will launch on PlayStation 5, and there's a special pre-order bundle available for PS5 players.

  The reveal of Carlotta and other Rinascita characters is exciting news for
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  fans. However, aside from a short trailer, Kuro Games has shared very little official information about the game's next chapter. Earlier
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  Version 2.0 leaks suggested that Phrolova would be the main antagonist in the update's Rinascita main storyline and that she might become playable in future patches. On the other hand,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  has confirmed that Rover's quest in Rinascita begins in Ragunna, a city that is coincidentally anticipating a colorful carnival.

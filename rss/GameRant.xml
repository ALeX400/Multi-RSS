  Characters in
  <strong>
   Dungeonborne
  </strong>
  don't naturally heal after life is lost, making healing an important aspect of surviving long enough to extract. There are a few items that can be used to heal, with one the most basic one being the Healing Potion.

  Healing Potions can be found randomly while exploring, but it won't always be enough to keep a player alive very long in a dungeon. Potions can be purchased at the camp between rounds, but gold has many other uses, and luckily, Healing Potions can be crafted; here's how to do it.

 <p>
  Healing Potions don't act right away but have a quick use time as your character only drinks the potion, unlike bandages which take up to six seconds to use. Potions can only be
  <strong>
   crafted while at camp and at the Alchemist for three vials of Cloudy Life Essence
  </strong>
  . There is no cost or wait time to craft these potions, and overall Cloudy Life Essence is a common item, making it best for players to stock up on Healing Potions whenever they can.

  <strong>
   Healing Potions can also be purchased at the Merchant,
  </strong>
  but once players fall into a rhythm of extracting often, crafting will be the better option just about every time. The only dilemma players will have is that bandages are crafted using the same resource.

 <p>
  After collecting Cloudy Life Essences, players will need to choose how to spend them, with both of these items ultimately restoring 300 life in total. It comes down to what players prefer for the class they are using, but never forget the importance of staying on the move in this game. While the monsters alone are deadly in this game, another player can always be around the corner ready to take you down. While the potions do lead to a delayed healing,
  <strong>
   their quick use add makes them a much safer option
  </strong>
  , and one that can be used in combat.

  Cloudy Life Essence is one of the most common items players will find during a round, unlike Heirlooms which are much more rare. This item is
  <strong>
   constantly found on dead monsters or chests
  </strong>
  , with the drop rates being about the same. Cloudy Life Essence also has a very high stack limit, letting players collect hundreds and only take up a few inventory slots. Cloudy Life Essences are also
  <strong>
   common rewards for completing daily quests
  </strong>
  . Players' main concern in getting this item should be extracted, as finding it will rarely be the issue.

  Arkham is the main antagonist of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Devil May Cry 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and the estranged father of Lady. A scholar who yearned for demonic power, Arkham sacrificed his own wife in order to attain power. He then pit the sons of Sparda, Vergil and Dante, against each other in order to unseal Temen-ni-gru. He used his alternate persona as the Jester to guide them toward the tower.

  Despite all of his machinations, Arkham failed to achieve the same level of power as Sparda, ultimately losing to both Vergil and Dante, who put aside their rivalry to defeat him. He still managed to survive the fight, albeit reverted to his human form. However, he was discovered and killed by Lady, who was there to take revenge for her mother.

  William Birkin, despite only appearing in a handful of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, is possibly one of the most important characters in that series' world. While working with fellow scientist Albert Wesker, Birkin created the T-virus, which caused Raccoon City's outbreak.

  While working on the G-virus, Birkin was attacked by the Umbrella Special Forces, who stole his completed research. Left for dead, Birkin injected himself with the G-virus, which eventually mutates him into the monster known as G. He would continue to stalk the streets of Raccoon City in his monstrous form until he is eventually killed by Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield in

  Fou-Lu is the main villain of

   <em>
    Breath of Fire 4

  , a later entry in one of Capcom's classic JRPG franchises. Fou-Lu is the founder of the Fou Empire, having awakened after a centuries-long sleep in order to wait for the birth of his "other half," Ryu.

  For short segments in the game, Fou-Lu is actually playable, allowing players to sympathize with his perspective. However, that does not stop him from coming into contact with Ryu and his allies, after which he is defeated and killed in battle.

  Asura was once one of the Eight Guardian Generals, but a ploy to use his daughter, Mithra, to generate Mantra pushes the other Generals to betray him and frame him for the murder of his wife, Durga. Though he is defeated, Asura returns to take his revenge and save his daughter once and for all in

  Albert Wesker is
  <em>
   the
  </em>
  most iconic villains in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise, and one that is responsible for many of the crises that occur throughout the series. His initial role had him pose as a S.T.A.R.S. Captain, but in truth, he was covertly helping Umbrella conduct their viral experiments.

 <p>
  Though he seemingly died in the first
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  game, Wesker was revealed to be alive due to having an experimental virus in his body. He returned as a major villain in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where he was ultimately killed by Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar.

  X is the first major successor to the original
  <em>
   Mega Man
  </em>
  series, whose main role is to hunt down Mavericks — criminal Reploids who have rebelled against humanity. X ultimately became known as a legendary hero, one who did his best to defend humanity at all costs.

      <title>New York Times Connections Hints and Answers for #410 July 25, 2024</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Connections
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a short, daily word game from the New York Times Games. Every day, it gives you a selection of seemingly-random words that need to be sorted into categories. Other than the words themselves, you don't get a single clue for what the categories might be.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":273} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":200,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->
 <p>
  And today's puzzle is much more challenging than the rules of
  <em>
   Connections
  </em>
  might make it sound. There are so many overlapping words that could go in several categories, and there are also a lot of red herring word combinations as well. If you are running out of tries and want to win, this article can help.

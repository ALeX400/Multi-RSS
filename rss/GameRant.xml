  The Trial of Chaos is one of the optional activities in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Path of Exile 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  that's suited for mid-high-level players. To say that it's difficult would be an understatement, as even characters that are fully kitted out can have trouble with it.

  Despite its relative difficulty, the Trials of Chaos are great sources of loot and currency in
  <em>
   PoE 2
  </em>
  . More importantly, it's the stepping stone for unlocking even more power for your character. Here's a brief overview of this activity, as well as some tips on how to clear it more easily.

  The Trial of Chaos is located within the aptly-named Temple of Chaos, which is in the Chimeral Wetlands region in Act 3. Players can enter this area at any time they wish, but in order to challenge the Trial of Chaos, they'll need the
  <strong>
   Chimeral Imbued Ultimatum
  </strong>
  item, which drops from Xyclucian the Chimera, a boss in the Chimeral Wetlands.

 <p>
  Once you obtain the Chimeral Imbued Ultimatum, you'll be able to come and go from the Trial of Chaos, but only until you complete that single run. In the future, if you want to challenge the Trial again, you'll need to find another Ultimatum via random drops.

  The Trial of Chaos is a gauntlet of encounters, with each having varying objectives. These can range from eradicating all enemies in an area to escorting a statue or retrieving Soul Cores. Monsters will swarm players during every encounter, but what truly makes this activity challenging are the Tribulations.

  A Tribulation is basically
  <strong>
   a negative modifier that skews every encounter against the player
  </strong>
  . Some of these are relatively tame, like increasing Monster Resistances or adding environmental hazards to each room. Meanwhile, others are much more punishing, with some making enemies always deal critical damage or adding hazards that can slow, stun or petrify players. If you can't clear enemies, go back and farm some more gear first.

 <p>
  Each run begins with players choosing one of three possible Tribulations before starting their first combat room. After the fighting is over, the cycle repeats, except
  <strong>
   the Tribulations from the previous room will carry over to the next one.

  Tips for Trial of Chaos
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Completing the initial Trial of Chaos quest is impossible without good equipment. Come back later when you're stronger.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you can comfortably defeat monsters in the Trial, consider farming it for equipment and XP by intentionally dying after getting loot.
  </li>
  <li>
   For farming, pick the Tribulation that increases Rare enemy spawns.
  </li>
  <li>
   Always pick Tribulations that work to your build's strengths.
  </li>
  <li>
   Avoid Tribulations that limit your mobility and movement options.

  Rewards
 </h3>
 <p>
  A successful Trials of Chaos run will reward you with all the loot that the Trialmaster shows you before each room, on top of all the other loot you pick up from enemies. If it's your first time finishing the Trial, you'll also gain two more Ascendancy points for your Ascension class in
  <em>
   PoE 2
  </em>
  . Take note that the Ascendancy Points reward is only given after the first Trial — subsequent runs will only give you loot.

      <title>Every Legacy Of Kain Game, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/every-legacy-of-kain-game-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Conceived in an alliance between Crystal Dynamics and Silicon Knights, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Legacy of Kain
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise debuted with a dark fantasy action RPG known as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Blood Omen
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Initially part of multiple potential projects inside Silicon Knights, the one known internally as the "Pillars of Nosgoth" was seen as the one with the most potential. Chronicling the rise and fall of a noble-turned-vampire named Kain, this lore-heavy franchise has consistently been one of the industry's most fascinating and influential series.

 <p>
  Its commitment to deep, complex mythology and spectacular writing is to be commended, as it was one of the early vanguards of cinematic action games. Despite the fact that a mainline entry hasn't been seen since 2003's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Defiance
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the long-standing conflict between Kain and his former ally Raziel has been one of gaming's most iconic rivalries. A remaster of the first two games has brought the series back into prominence, and now is the best time to take a look back at the franchise and the games stack up against each other.

  is the debut of nearly everything that fans hold dear about this franchise. Kain, voiced by the stupendous Simon Templeton, makes his first appearance and brings a sense of gravitas and class that would define the character for decades. Set in the land of Nosgoth,
  <em>
   Blood Omen
  </em>
  sees the noble Kain murdered in its opening moments, then reborn as a vampire as he sets off on a quest for revenge.

 <p>
  Driven by selfish desires, Kain's journey across Nosgoth brings him into conflict with various clans in the vampire world, as well as the Hylden Lord. Many of the aspects that the franchise would become known for, like its deep lore and complex storytelling, started in this 2D action RPG. Combat is bloody and fast-paced. It is one of the PS1's most underrated RPGs, with excellent music and a voice cast that is absolutely stacked.
  <em>
   Blood Omen
  </em>
  is available on the PS4 and PS5 through emulation.

  Following a legal battle between Silicon Knights and Crystal Dynamics, the
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  IP found its way into the hands of the latter, and they began work on a sequel. It was later combined with a project directed by Amy Henig, known as Project Shifter, and resulted in what is still one of the finest early 3D action games of the era.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver
   </em>
  </strong>
  introduced the character of Raziel, situating him as a primary rival to Kain, and one of the key protagonists of the franchise. Betrayed by Kain for surpassing him, Raziel climbs from the depths of the underworld on a mission of vengeance, guided by the Lovecraftian entity known as the Elder God. The game's lush, open-ended 3D environments are impressive to look at, and its unique mechanic of shifting between worlds is still one of the most innovative mechanics of the era. Thanks to a recent remaster by Aspyr, this timeless classic is available on all modern hardware.

  The early 2000s were good for the
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  series, as it saw three releases in as many years, starting in 2001 with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soul Reaver 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Taking advantage of the powerful new hardware, developers Crystal Dynamics crafted a detailed world with large 3D environments and continued where the events of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soul Reaver
   </em>
  </strong>
  left off. After being forced to cut multiple areas and story points from the first game due to budget and time constraints, Crystal Dynamics repurposed many of those elements for the sequel.

 <p>
  Drawing from ancient theology and the works of writer Joseph Campbell,
  <em>
   Soul Reaver 2
  </em>
  put the emphasis back on Raziel and Kain, utilizing themes of fatalism and free will. Their relationship saw a much deeper, more complex revision, as their eternal struggle takes a sharp left turn. This feeds into its gameplay as well. The combat and exploration was much improved over
  <em>
   Soul Reaver 1
  </em>
  , feeling more akin to an interactive novel as opposed to a traditional video game. It is still one of the PS2's best action games, and is available on all modern hardware thanks to the recent remaster.

  Despite a fairly positive reception for 2003's
  <em>
   Defiance
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  franchise would go quiet for the next two decades. Numerous reboot projects and sequels were attempted, but nothing ever came of it, and the series quietly slipped into obscurity. But rumors started to surface in mid-2024 about a potential remaster of 1999's
  <em>
   Soul Reaver
  </em>
  and its 2001 sequel, and the project was finally announced in September as a surprisingly ambitious revival.

 <p>
  Featuring all-new character models, improved controls and a photo mode, in addition to numerous QOL changes, this excellent remaster of
  <em>
   Soul Reaver 1
  </em>
  and 2 almost feels like an entirely new project. In addition, this outstanding package includes content that was cut from the first game, allowing players to explore what could have been. In terms of remaster projects,
  <em>
   Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered
  </em>
  is one of the best. It lovingly restores a forgotten IP and allows a peek behind the curtain in one of gaming's most fascinating development cycles.

  After establishing the concept of multiple timelines and universes at the end of
  <em>
   Soul Reaver 2
  </em>
  , Crystal Dynamics doubled down on that with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Legacy of Kain: Defiance.
   </strong>
  </em>
  The game explores a story built around paradoxes and the cosmic shifts at play thanks to the choices of both Kain and Raziel. Diving deep into the creation of Nosgoth and the longstanding rivalry between Kain and Raziel,
  <em>
   Defiance
  </em>
  complicates this even further by making the two of them playable in the same game, a first for the series.

  It's a fitting decision, as this outstanding PS2 title depicts the final chapter of Kain and Raziel's story. Playing as these two throughout the adventure adds some weight and stakes to the whole affair. The signature hack and slash combat feels better than ever. Kain is ruthless and bloodthirsty, while Raziel's calmer, more refined skill set shines in unique ways.
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain: Defiance
  </em>
  took some obvious inspiration from a few contemporaries, as it feels like a mix of
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  with classic
  <em>
   Soul Reaver
  </em>
  . This action-packed, impeccably-written finale is still one of the PS2's best games, and is due for a revival of some sort after the remaster of the first two
  <em>
   Soul Reaver
  </em>
  titles.

  In an effort to split the series into two distinct entities, that of

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Blood Omen 2

  was poised to star Kain as its protagonist. Focusing on a young Kain prior to the events of
  <em>

  </em>
  , the events of
  <em>
   Blood Omen 2
  </em>
  are triggered thanks to the end of
  <em>

  , creating what is known as the fourth timeline. In this universe, Kain's bloody ascent to the top and conflict with the Sarafan Lord drives its outstanding narrative.

  In what may be Simon Templeton's best performance as Kain, he truly embodies the character. Watching the conflict escalate from the dark streets of Nosgoth all the way to the Hylden City is just part of what makes this 3D action game as good as it is. Combat is suitably gory, with sword swings that feel excellent and some fun powers, known as Dark Gifts, for Kain to use. Using Mist to hide in fog, then stealth killing an enemy, or the satisfying Jump to clear great distances, adds variety to
  <em>
   Blood Omen 2's
  </em>
  design. Recently,
  <em>
   Blood Omen 2
  </em>
  was made available on the PS4 and PS5 through backwards compatibility, making it easier than ever to jump into the
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  franchise's best game.

  is showing no signs of slowing down, with the upcoming Rockstar project still reportedly holding firm on its late 2025 release window.

  While the launch content of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  is expected to be massive across its single-player and online modes, there is still a lot of pressure on the title to deliver an impressive amount of post-launch content, particularly in relation to single-player. This is an area that the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  franchise has been infamously lacking in for quite some time now, with
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  having to look as far back as
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  to learn some real lessons on what memorable post-launch single-player content should look like for the franchise. It already seems as if
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's story is going to be quite grounded, intricate, and story-driven, and this should allow the game to emulate the kinds of alternative-perspective DLCs that
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  used to great success for its own story.

  The story of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is a massively popular and defining experience for the wider
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  franchise, with its bold decision to feature three simultaneous protagonists offering new gameplay avenues that played into the strengths of the narrative as well as its major setting of Los Santos and the surrounding areas. Despite the success that
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  's story mode garnered, it has received essentially no follow-up content since its first release in 2013, with Rockstar shifting most of its attention towards
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  instead.

  The lack of post-launch expansions for
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  's story is a real stain on what is otherwise one of the most record-breaking pieces of media ever made, with this lack of action on Rockstar's behalf being made all the more confusing by the franchise's prior success with this kind of content. 2008's
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  stands as the peak of what the franchise can offer in terms of story expansions that directly tie into and flesh out a game's narrative, with both
  <em>
   The Lost and Damned
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Ballad of Gay Tony
  </em>
  being fantastic additions to the title.

  Both of these single-player story expansions are set directly alongside the main narrative of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  , with the events of the main game tying directly into both
  <em>
   TLaD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   TBoGT
  </em>
  . With both of these expansions featuring new protagonists, they offer fascinating new perspectives to the base game, with famous
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  protagonist Niko Bellic even appearing as a minor character in both of these post-launch experiences.

 <p>
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  chose not to feature a single post-launch expansion for its main story, much to the dismay of fans. Recent leaks even suggest that Rockstar once had lofty plans for this kind of DLC, with Trevor Philips acting as an undercover agent for a corrupt branch of the government being one example of a reportedly canceled expansion for
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  . It seems that many of these canceled
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  expansions still feature the three main protagonists in leading roles, however, and any story DLC for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  should instead go down the fresh protagonist route of
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  's post-launch content.

  The scale of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's main story is expected to be massive, meaning the narrative potential of intertwining stories and alternate perspectives related to its major events seems essentially limitless. Rockstar could easily capitalize on DLC stories that supplement the main narrative, perhaps related to rumored aspects of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  such as Jason's potential role as an undercover police officer, with new characters shining fresh lights on the skewed perspectives of the main story and its two protagonists.
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  managed to increase the scope of its mainline story massively with well-thought-out story expansions featuring new characters, and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  should revive this successful formula within its own ambitious story.

  Most players love the idea of switching around their active party members from time to time to keep things engaging in the long run. However, some JRPGs go all out with this concept and let players mess around with a ridiculously high number of playable characters.

 <p>
  This can be overwhelming, but players who know what they're in for can focus on a core set of party members while keeping others for the novelty they bring to the table. Meanwhile, some gamers who love to experiment can go all out with their party combinations in these JRPGs, which can last for endless hours.

  Frederic Chopin is a legendary composer, with his mind serving as the setting of a JRPG full of unique party members to choose from. It's a substantial number that isn't too overwhelming and makes

  <em>
   Trails of Cold Steel 4

  is a game full of so many playable characters that it can be confusing to figure out the best squad that players can stick with. It's better to set up Orbments for a few characters since a player's budget will need to be massive to accommodate every single member of the squad.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  , the sequel moved things in a completely new direction.
  <em>
   Chrono Cross
  </em>
  featured battle transitions, a lack of traditional leveling, and a huge cast of party members that was ridiculous.

 <p>
  This made it puzzling that players were limited to just three characters in battle. This made switching out party members more challenging than it should've been, especially since there was a huge chance that two of the three slots would usually be occupied by a mandatory party member anyway.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   SaGa
  </em>
  series is known for being a gameplay-first franchise with some fun games to get into, and
  <em>
   Scarlet Grace – Ambitions
  </em>
  is no exception here. Combat is a huge part of the overall package that must be mastered for players to enjoy what this JRPG brings to the table.

 <p>
  The title boasts a silly number of recruitable characters, and players must figure out the best party that will suit them in combat while focusing on a few backup party members from time to time. Trying to pay equal attention to all recruitable party members can make for a frustratingly long experience, especially if some characters are too weak to tackle late-game challenges.

  The
  <em>
   Suikoden

  games are known for boasting a huge number of playable characters, and the second mainline entry is no exception here. Players can recruit a ridiculous number of party members throughout an epic adventure full of war, strife, and the odd flashes of hope.

 <p>
  Since the party limit is generous enough to let players use six characters at once, there are a lot of opportunities to mix and match party members. However, this can become harder and harder as players gain too many party members in their squad, forcing them to play favorites and ignore latecomers to the squad.

  is a game known for boasting a ridiculously high number of playable characters, making it one of the most unique JRPGs players can get their hands on. It helps that the battle system is simple enough for players to not get too intimidated as they slowly learn the ropes.

  The game promotes a ton of freedom, letting players duel NPCs and get invested in the lives of other characters because of how detailed their schedules are. It's an immersive JRPG that can seem rather daunting to get into, only for players to fall in love with this unique world in no time.

  <li>
   After that, find and tap or click on the Codes button located in the middle right.

  It is straightforward to play
  <em>
   Shoot Wall Simulator
  </em>
  . To make effective progress, players need to shoot and break walls and get Wins. These Wins act as a game currency and can be used to move to new locations. To get Wins faster, it is necessary to buy pets and train. To make this process much more accessible, players will find two buttons at the bottom of the screen: Auto Train and Auto Shoot. Players can press one of them and go into AFK.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise has explored a wide variety of historical settings and major events, since debuting in 2007. The series’ most recent title,
  <em>
   Mirage
  </em>
  , saw players explore 9th-Century Baghdad, in an origin story for one of the series’ overarching antagonists, Basim. While the larger franchise has transitioned to a more self-contained and ancient list of settings and events, more recent history presents a host of compelling eras in which the centuries-long conflict between Assassins and Templars could be set. In the early 2010s, an avatar that depicted an Assassin from one such era was released. Should the concept of this avatar be adapted to a video game, it could be the springboard to the next great
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  setting.

  Despite releasing 13 mainline titles and a variety of spin-off titles, the
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  franchise remains one of the most popular in gaming. Since its very first entry, the franchise has explored the conflict between two factions, the Assassins and the Templars, and the supernatural origins of its futuristic universe. Over time, fans have seen the conflict play out across Renaissance Italy, the American Revolution, the Golden Age of Piracy, the Peloponnesian War, and more.

 <p>
  UbiWorkshop was a branch of Ubisoft that created and published multimedia that elaborated on stories inspired by or from the main
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series. One such form of multimedia was limited edition artwork and art collections. In 2010, UbiWorkshop announced their next art book that would include a special “Carte Blanche” section, featuring work from then-well-known concept artists like Craig Mullin and JameNG. What’s more, UbiWorkshop announced that they would be taking submissions from fans worldwide, with the best possibly being added to this section.

 <p>
  Artists were given free rein to design and illustrate anything in their power, including original concepts for the
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  universe. While many would submit, only a few were chosen, including an original concept by artist SeedSeven. The artist submitted a work titled "Seed7-Carte-Blanche-Assassin-Cowboy," which depicted a gunslinging Assassin standing over the body of a Templar Sheriff, while a noose swings in the background.

 <p>
  The artwork was included in the "Carte Blanche" section, gaining recognition as an exceptional fan-generated concept. 2012 saw the piece resurface as an official part of the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Universe
  </em>
  line of products, in the form of a PSN avatar. Now boasting the official title
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Universe
  </em>
  Cowboy Assassin Avatar, the art was made available to purchase on the PSN store, where it remained until avatars were removed in 2020.

  While recent years have seen the
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  franchise explore the earliest events in its timeline,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Universe
  </em>
  Cowboy Assassin could act as a springboard to a compelling future setting. Ubisoft already has the perfect character design for its grisly protagonist, and the Templar Sheriff depicted in the original art provides a solid option for a main antagonist or assassination target. However, this particular concept seems unlikely until the overarching Basim narrative has run its course.

  Fans have clamored for a Wild West-based

  title for years, some of whom are likely unaware an official piece of artwork exists. While it remains to be seen whether an
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed

 <p>
  Egyptian, Japanese, and Viking-based assassins were among the most compelling “free rein” concepts included in the Carte Blanche art project, and now all three exist. Fans of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed

  franchise continue to hold out hope that their favorite eras or events will one day be adapted into a mainline title. Until the series’ current narrative concludes, those hoping for a Wild West entry will need to remain patient.

  introduces a lot of unique and interesting spells to the players. Unfortunately, most of these aren't particularly viable in the meta, making them useless for anyone who isn't a completionist. However, there are some genuinely great spells hiding among the mass of mid-tier incantations and sorceries, like the Golden Arcs incantation.

 <p>
  Fishing is a fun and lucrative activity in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palia
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with numerous species to discover and catch. However, some fish are much trickier to find and catch than others owing to their rarity or fishing level prerequisites. One such fish is
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  's Giant Goldfish, a stunning orange and white colored species that's grown to a legendary size. As a fish that doesn't spawn as regularly as other varieties, you might be curious about
  <strong>
   where to find a Giant Goldfish
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  and how to catch one.

  While Giant Goldfish aren't necessarily the easiest type of fish to catch in

 <p>
  Giant Goldfish are an
  <strong>
   Epic
  </strong>
  type of fish in
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  , so they are a pretty rare spawn. While you can find Giant Goldfish in ponds across Bahari Bay and Kilima Valley, they may take some time to appear. One of the best places to catch Giant Gold Fish is in the
  <strong>
   Mirror Pond Ruins
  </strong>
  north of Kilima Valley. However, although you can fish up Giant Goldfish at
  <strong>
   any time of day,
  </strong>
  you need to prepare a few key things.

 <p>
  To catch Giant Goldfish, it's essential to have plenty of
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  's
  <strong>
   Glow Worms
  </strong>
  to use as
  <strong>
   bait
  </strong>
  . Like other rare or epic fish, Giant Goldfish can also be pretty feisty, so you also need to make sure you've got top-notch equipment to reel them in. This means upgrading your fishing rod to at least a
  <strong>
   Fine Rod
  </strong>
  , a more durable and easier piece of kit to handle than a Makeshift or Standard Fishing Rod.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":900} -->

 <p>
  You can also cast your Fishing Rod
  <strong>
   anywhere in the ponds
  </strong>
  , like the Mirror Pond Ruins, so it's not necessary to fish in circular ripples. However, patience is essential, as it can take some time for Giant Goldfish to appear. You'll probably fish out other varieties first, such as
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="549008" style="; ;">
   Scarlet Koi
  </span>
  ,
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="548750" style="; ;">
   Mottled Gobi
  </span>
  , and
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="547988" style="; ;">
   Cloudfish
  </span>
  . Keep trying, though, and provided you've got plenty of Glow Worms on hand, you'll soon catch yourself a Giant Goldfish. It's a valuable species worth a whopping
  <strong>
   1,220 gold
  </strong>
  for the base variety or around
  <strong>
   1,830 Gold
  </strong>
  for Star quality.

 <p>
  If it's your first time catching an Epic fish in
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  , you'll also grab the 'My First Epic Fish' accomplishment. Catching Giant Goldfish also counts towards other fishing accomplishments in
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  , such as the Master Angler accomplishment.

 <p>
  Very soon,
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans will be graced with a new title, just one year after the bombshell
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  dropped.
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be the first mainline
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game to star Princess Zelda herself as the main playable character, and it's celebrating the occasion by bringing a unique spin to the franchise's traditional gameplay. Returning to a top-down perspective,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  will allow players to copy and generate objects and enemies to take a free-form approach in their quest to rescue Link.

 <p>
  It's an exciting and surprising title that's also fulfilling an old fan request, so it's no wonder why many count it among the June 2024 Nintendo Direct’s highlights. The one sticking point some viewers have had is its art style, which is shared with the Nintendo Switch remake of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
  </em>
  . By looks alone, both
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  are built on the same bones, but that should become especially apparent when an alternate gameplay style associated with the old Game Boy
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  takes over.

 <p>
  A large portion of
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  ’s reveal trailer and preview footage is devoted to the new Echo ability. Having been granted a Trip Rod by the fairy Tri, Princess Zelda can make imitations of objects, certain environmental fixtures, and even enemies to solve puzzles, fight monsters, and navigate Hyrule. For the most part, this process resembles
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , with fans even noticing some physical similarities between
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   ALttP
  </em>
  ’s Hyrule Kingdom. However, fans should not make the mistake of thinking an art style is all
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has in common with
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  as well.

  Link’s Awakening Has Lent Echoes of Wisdom A Rare Trait

 <p>
  One of the shots in the
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  trailer footage shows Zelda fully submerged underwater, with the camera assuming a side profile instead of the normal top-down view. Considering how committed the game otherwise is to being a top-down adventure, going fully 2D at points comes as a surprise. This particular scene resembles the side view swimming found in
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  , especially the Angler’s Tunnel where Link fights the Angler Fish dungeon boss. It's safe to assume that this won't be the only time
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  shares this quirk with
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  , which could be to its benefit.

 <p>
  Side-scrolling gameplay has a greater presence in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  than many fans realize. Its dominance in
  <em>
   Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link
  </em>
  is well-remembered, but even the original NES
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  had screens faking a 2D perspective whenever players found dungeon items. The Game Boy trio of
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages
  </em>
  all make sporadic use of it, and
  <em>
   Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  fittingly renders roughly half of its GBA screen gameplay in 2D.
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  ’s hybrid approach is the most recognizable of its kind, and now it has another chance to share its rare view of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  gameplay.

  How Echoes of Wisdom Could Adapt Link’s Awakening's Side-Scrolling
 </h3>
 <p>
  Chances are good that the ratio of 2D-to-top-down gameplay in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  will be similar to
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  . It will come up occasionally, often underground as another brief trailer scene demonstrates, and there could even be an entirely 2D boss.
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has an air meter that will keep water areas brief, but, in a notable change from
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  , Zelda can jump like
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  Link without the aid of a Roc’s Feather. Combining these 2D areas’ typical platforming emphasis and the many Echoes that can help Zelda change elevation, the 2D areas of
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  should play off of one of
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  's strengths in a delightful way.

   <em>
    Ultimate Football
   </em>
   .

   Next, in the main menu, go to the Store tab.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go to the Redeem a Code section.
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter or paste the code in the Insert Code Here field and click on the tick. After that, the reward will be received.

  Note that players who have just started playing the game will not be able to redeem codes. They must first spend 3 hours in
  <em>

  </em>
  for this option to become available.

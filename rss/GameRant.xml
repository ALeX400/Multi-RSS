  Tonatiuh in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a sky-faring ship built by the Lord of the Cinder City. As a flying ship, it's no wonder that it's located far above the ground, floating between the clouds. After reaching the legendary place, players who try to jump down will find themselves falling for a really long time with nothing but gray clouds in sight. Once the long seconds pass, players will finally start to see the landscape of Natlan, looking small from way up there.

  <strong>
   Under the Tonatiuh's Wings

  is an achievement in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  that celebrates what and where Tonatiuh is. The trophy is obtained from an area in the sky, but not anywhere close to how far up Tonatiuh is.

  In the first puzzle, throwing the Relay Ball into the Ball Path Converter will cause the Relay Ball to be thrown into the sky, as the goal is not aligned with the Converter. Therefore, players must do the following to solve the riddle:

  Most people assume open-world games to be these joyful experiences that fans can't get enough of. While this is true in the majority of cases,
  <strong>
   some open-world games feature elements of horror
  </strong>
  that can make these sandboxes feel rather unnerving.

 <p>
  Players must brave the dangers of these open worlds and survive by any means necessary, which is easier said than done. Nightmarish enemies, oppressive environments, and stingy economies are just a few of the many ways that these scary open-world games ramp up the tension.

    Days Gone

  </strong>
  had its fair share of problems, but most fans would agree that this open-world game came into its own after a relatively slow beginning. The fact that players don't even encounter a zombie horde until they've invested a few hours into the experience is a testament to this game's slow burn.

 <p>
  The panic players experience when a horde descends on them is immense in the game's early goings, with a lack of resources ensuring that players must either run or succumb to the zombies who are trying to tear them apart. This zombie open-world game may have some rough edges, but it excels at scaring players when everything clicks.

  The game's Volatiles are nightmarish to deal with and will force players to sprint as fast as possible as these super-powered zombies chase them down. Reaching a safe haven when these Volatiles are mere seconds away from pouncing goes a long way in helping
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  stand out as one of the scariest open-world games players can get their hands on.

  Fans of the
  <em>
   Metro
  </em>
  series were understandably worried when news came out that the third game in the series would feature an open world. People wondered if the oppressive and horrifying atmosphere of this franchise would translate well to a sandbox, but all these complaints disappeared upon release.

  The open world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metro Exodus
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the scariest environments that players can get immersed in, with the hardcore gameplay only adding to the tension. Players will also be elated to find that some of the game's levels take place in linear environments, channeling the immaculate atmosphere of the previous two games.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Project Zomboid
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the deepest and most engaging open-world zombie games players can get their hands on. The rudimentary graphics may not seem all that appealing, but players don't know true horror until they invest in their character's stats only for an unrelenting wave of zombies to arrive in a bid to end their run.

 <p>
  Fortifying hideouts, leveling up skills, and scrounging for resources are a huge part of what makes this game such a joy to play. Players will be nervous every single time they have to hunt for supplies, since a single mistake can lead to a wave of zombies tearing the player character apart in no time.

   <em>
    Luma Island

  While at first glance, players might think that
  <em>
   Luma Island
  </em>
  doesn't have any fast travel mechanic in the game, there is a way to travel to different biomes quickly right from your Farm. Since the process isn't explained clearly, players can play through the entire game without unlocking it. In this guide, we'll give you a complete rundown of how the fast travel system works in
  <em>
   Luma Island

  and how you can unlock it.

 <p>
  To unlock Fast Travel, players must build a Cottage on
  <em>
   Luma Island
  </em>
  . But before you can build a Cottage, you'll have to find its Blueprint. While most blueprints in the game can be found in the Blueprint Shop in Town, you'll have to go to the Forest biome for this one.

  Head to the beach area in the northwestern part of the Forest Zone. You'll see a Golden Chest on an island near a tree. You'll find the Cottage Blueprint inside it. After unlocking the blueprint, you'll find it in the Houses section of your Drawings menu.

  As you can see, most of the resources required to build the Cottage on
  <em>
   Luma Island
  </em>
  can be found in the Forest biome. So you'll have to spend quite a while exploring the zone picking up crafting materials. Consider upgrading your Copper Pickaxe and Copper Axe a few times to harvest material faster.

  You'll also have to help repair Sophia's General Store to unlock the Scaffolding and Cottage Permit for purchase. The Scaffolding costs 500 Gold for each unit while the Cottage Permit costs 1000 Coins. If you've been progressing through your Professions, Coins shouldn't be a big issue for you at this point.

  Simply building the Cottage isn't enough for players to use fast travel in
  <em>
   Luma Island
  </em>
  . You'll also have to explore each biome and unlock the fast travel points in them so that you can travel to it from your Farm. If you've explored the Forest region properly while gathering supplies, you should already have the Forest fast travel point unlocked.

  Head inside the Cottage on your Farm and use the Trapdoor to go to the basement. You'll notice a glowing green portal in one corner of the basement. Walk up and interact with it. Now you can hold the interact button to teleport to the biomes you've unlocked.

 <p>
  Creature collector games have a long and storied history, but they have always been an inherently engaging and fun pastime. From the monoliths of the genre like
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  to the ambitious indie titles putting their own spin on archetypal formulas and mechanics, there's always something to look at and explore with games that let players rear up beasts in some capacity. Being able to raise creatures - tracking and charting their growth from birth onwards - doesn't appear in a lot of games, but when it does, it's usually a treat.
 </p>

 <p>
  Whether in colony sims, farming sims, or monster tamers, there's a variety of different niches in which players can hope to raise creatures. Whether this is to build a lifelong bond with an animal companion, gain one more pack animal, or make the start of some sort of ravenous beast army, is usually up to player discretion. These games in particular form a diverse range of genres allowing players to raise creatures from eggs onwards, usually to whatever end they see fit.

  Inspired by classic
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games on the original Game Boy and Game Boy Advance,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Crown
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an incredibly interesting spin on the monster-tamer genre, taking a much more adult approach to the setting and capturing the charm of those early
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  designs perfectly.

 <p>
  Creatures can be hatched from eggs in this game, and also form eggs for hatching subsequently after fusion, which makes for an incredibly interesting system of building a team to one's liking from a host of options.

  Eggs have been around in almost all of the mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games to date. From the Bad Egg of
  <em>
   Emerald
  </em>
  , spawning a slew of myths about the game, to the Strange Eggs of
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  and the droves of adorable level 1 creatures every player loves to see.

 <p>
  Eggs are only hatched by players in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  who carry them while walking around, filling up a slot in their party. One interesting thing to note is that if a Pokemon with the Flame Body ability is at the head of the party, the steps needed to hatch eggs are halved.

  Chicken eggs are the most common example of this, but there are some rarer eggs available, such as void chicken eggs, or even the huge and ancient dinosaur eggs for those wanting a more exotic farm.

 <p>
  A no-holds-barred grindfest of a game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Siralim 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has some incredibly interesting ideas worked into its foundation. Creatures can be fused and raised from eggs in this brutal monster-tamer roguelike, which has a broad away of stats and modifiers.

 <p>
  This game is perfect for those who want to sink hundreds of hours into tweaking the absolute, inarguable, most fine-tuned builds they possibly can. Each creature can have its stats altered by fusion and items in such a way that they are essentially the players to shape in their image.

  Few games are as chaotic as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Its aesthetic is chaotic - a
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  -style high fantasy world with very
  <em>
   Pokemon-
  </em>
  esque (maybe a little too
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -esque) designs, photo-realistic guns and equipment, all paired with anime character designs. It's...a lot.

 <p>
  But it also has to be said that there are few things as cathartic as stumbling upon a rare-looking egg in the wild and hatching it to find some new, absolutely bizarre, or terrific Pal to add to one's collection.

 <p>
  Like most of the systems in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rimworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there is a complex but surprisingly straightforward system for the fertilization of a host of creature eggs. Farming in
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  and building up a good stock of animals is a great path to long-term success.

 <p>
  Whether players want to breed chickens or ostriches, if they can get a male and female together, it will eventually happen. Baby creatures are far easier to tame and working with baby animals can be a cathartic break from the horrors that often lie in wait in
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  .

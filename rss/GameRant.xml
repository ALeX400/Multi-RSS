  The Hossberg Wetlands of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  are suffering from a serious blight thanks to the released elven gods, which is partly why the Gray Wardens have created a temporary headquarters in the area. You need to take samples of the blight as part of the main quest, but you can also help out the locals as side quests.

  One such side quest is "Only an Echo." You can find the quest giver, Ida, on the stairs between Grey Hold and Lavendel. She asks you to investigate the disappearance of her friend, Ursa Voss, who seemed to know the blight was coming but never evacuated.

  Before you can reach the Flooded Farmlands, which is where the Voss home is, you'll need to collect all the samples required for the main quest "Something Wrong." Doing so will open the path you need to take to reach this area. You can technically skip the last sample or two, but getting them all will make it easier to explore the Flooded Farmlands in peace.

  The quest wants you to start with the Voss house, but the primary goal is to find four notes in this area that explain what happened to the family. Here's how to get them all:

 <ul>
  <li>
   One note is to the
   <strong>
    left of the entrance
   </strong>
   to this area. Climb the wooden stairs to get a good angle on the blight boils on the cliff wall and in the ruined building, then explode the boil they protected. The note is
   <strong>
    under the protected boil
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Another note is
   <strong>
    next to the well to the right
   </strong>
   of the entrance. You can also interact with the well to get a big hint about what happened to the family (along with an explanation for the quest's name).
  </li>
  <li>
   The second pair of notes are
   <strong>
    in the Voss house
   </strong>
   , but there's too much blight on it to get inside. To make the blight vulnerable, start by heading through the stone wall into the Lavendel Barricade area. Turn right and go up the stairs to destroy a blight boil. Follow the vein and destroy two more boils to make the blight covering the front door vulnerable. The note is on the table inside.
  </li>
  <li>
   The last note is in the
   <strong>
    torn-off section of the house on the right
   </strong>
   . Another blight barrier is in the way, so destroy the boils below and inside the torn-off section to make it vulnerable. Cross the balance beam and climb the ladder to get the last note.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  The four notes point to something in the well that possessed the Voss family and forced them to stay in place as the blight exploded across the landscape. Interact with the well to bury it, then return to Ida. Your quest rewards include 500 XP, 200 gold, 5 Fade-Touched Ore, and +50 Gray Wardens Strength.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization
  </em>
  games have been packed full of hundreds of achievements since the fifth installment, with a whole host of challenges for determined players to seek out. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Civilization 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  these difficult tasks are even trickier. While there are some that players might unlock accidentally through normal play, others require specific routes through the game or gunning for strange circumstances from the beginning and potentially throwing a spanner in the works of long-term success in the intricate strategy game

  Whether because of the sheer difficulty of a task or because of an over-reliance on random chance, some achievements are much harder than others. Here are the most difficult achievements to obtain in
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization 6

  , not including any of the DLC achievements.

 <p>
  Fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will get a kick out of the reference to the classic comic book characters in this achievement. Players will have to own New York and unlock Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Donatello as Great People which will require them to remain in the Renaissance period.

  Choosing to pour the majority of their resources into Faith and production will help, but after Michelangelo and Donatello, either by attracting them with Great People Points or by 'Patronizing' them by buying them with Gold or Faith, the Great Engineer Leonardo da Vinci may not appear when players need him to. Players might have to resort to reloading previous saves until luck is on their side to unlock this frustrating achievement.

  Another achievement that often depends on start location and how quickly a player can mobilize against Nubia is the 'Claim The Fourth Cataract' Achievement. Players have to choose the Egyptian civilization and should immediately begin expanding to be as close to Nubia as possible.

  Fans will have to ensure that they formally declare war on Nubia first, and then quickly take the capital. They should build catapults before they attack while keeping in mind that the earlier they go for Nubia the lower its defenses will be.

 <p>
  On the surface, 'Missed That Day In History Class' is a relatively easy achievement to unlock. A player running the Roman empire in
  <em>
   Civ 6
  </em>
  only has to build a Legion unit and then keep it until there is nuclear waste to clear up. The obstacle comes from how short the window in which players can get legionaries is, keeping them alive and not upgrading them or losing them in battle.

 <p>
  After this, players will likely have to be targeted by nuclear warheads by an enemy to give them radioactive tiles to clear. Using a Legion will complete the achievement, but many have to set up unique scenarios to ensure that they can get this achievement with minimal complications.

  Players will need to hunt down all of the luxuries that are usually spread out across the map to encourage trading with far-off civilizations. As the Aztecs, players will want to expand quickly regardless, but fans who are working towards this achievement will find that is only feasible if they can push very far or even conquer most of their neighbors to manage to acquire every single luxury.

 <p>
  For the 'Seven Wonders Of The Post-Apocalyptic World' achievement, players will need to rush their technology progress ahead to get hold of nuclear warheads. For many players online, the easiest way to do this is by bombing their own cities - players must ensure from the very start that they build wonders within a two-tile radius of a center point so that one nuke will pillage everything at once

 <p>
  Although using weapons of mass destruction on their own civilization seems counter-intuitive, trying to carry out this highly specific task on an enemy will require even more careful planning and knowledge of what they have built within their borders.

 <p>
  One of the rarest achievements in the game, the 'Trans-Siberian Railroad' is a major feat for any leader to undertake. The 60 tiles required does not include the tiles that roads are built on, but rather the tiles on the most direct route to their capital.

 <p>
  Trading posts have to be built up and down the route to allow the route to reach far enough, and so the amount of land that players have to have control of is astounding. While for some leaders like Trajan, who is gifted with automatic trade routes, this would be an easy task, players are forced to play as Russia for this achievement making for an arduous task that requires patience and proper planning.

 <p>
  Fans and completionists will have to cause a major upset in a nearby civilization to get this tricky achievement. Playing as the Polish civilization, gamers should push towards the closest opponent as soon as possible. Poland has a special effect that triggers a culture bomb, claiming all adjacent tiles, whenever they build an encampment or fort on a tile.

 <p>
  Players should set up embassies in neighboring lands so that they can keep an eye on the tiles of the opposition. As soon as a wonder is being built, they must rush to build an encampment nearby. However, it becomes a difficult feat because all of this requires a measured strategy to ensure they have the resources, room, and knowledge.

  Despite being acquired by the highest percentage of players on this list, the 'God-Like' achievement is one of the only challenges that cannot be manipulated by save-scumming or by engineering a game mode to make victory easy. Players will have to actually become masters of the grand strategy game and tactically reach a victory on the hardest difficulty in
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  despite the AI being given massive bonuses to overall production and getting a head start when it matters most in the early game.

  While many of the other achievements on this list are hard to get because they require the player to go out of their way to perform strange actions, 'God-Like' tasks fans with practicing and learning how to beat back the AI opponents and achieve any kind of victory ahead of them.

      <title>Best PlayStation Plus Games (November 2024)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  On June 13, 2022, Sony launched its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  in North America. Split into three tiers, this model combines the previous version of PS Plus with PS Now; depending on which level someone subscribes to, they will gain access to certain services and games.

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: featured video below first paragraph! -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month):
   </strong>
   This tier is the equivalent of the old PS Plus. A subscription includes online access, monthly free games, and discounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Extra ($14.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential tier benefits, Extra provides access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential and Extra tier benefits, Premium includes a library of classic games (PS3, PS2, PSP, and PS1), trials, and cloud streaming in certain regions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   PS Plus Premium
  </strong>
  has over 700 games covering more than two decades of PlayStation history. Such a huge collection can be overwhelming, and the PS Plus app does not make it very easy to browse through the library; as such, it can be useful to know this tier's highlights before investing in a subscription. Each month, Sony adds a handful of new games. While most of these are PS5 and PS4 releases, they are occasionally accompanied by a few classic titles.

  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  garnered a decent reception at launch, but the hype was somewhat muted due to technical issues. More than two years later, the game is nowadays in pretty good shape, making it the perfect PS Plus Extra option for anyone craving a sandbox with great movement and verticality. Zombie-themed projects are relatively easy to come by, and the same can really be said for open-world games; however, only a handful of titles blend the two formulas, and
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  serves as one of the better examples of this marriage.

  While more action than horror, the former is driven by a satisfying parkour system that turns Villedor into an awesome free-running playground. The minute-to-minute gameplay is constantly top-notch, and players unlock enough new tricks and toys to keep things fresh throughout the relatively lengthy campaign.

  Removed from PS Plus Extra in June 2024,
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  only stayed away for a couple of months, returning as part of the November 2024 lineup. Obviously, Rockstar's game is among the most popular projects of all time, so it is a big deal in a vacuum. That said, some of that excitement is hurt by its "leave and bring back" cycle.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  is great, and there is nothing really that can change that. The story campaign has likely been experienced by most people at this point, but the PS4 and PS5 versions available on PS Plus could be worth trying if somebody only played the original PS3 release.
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is the ultimate time sink too.

  For most months, picking the biggest new PS Plus Extra game is just a matter of personal taste; however, August 2024 was not one of those months. That's not meant as a criticism of games like
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Watch Dogs 2
  </em>
  , but rather a celebration of CD Projekt Red's RPG masterpiece.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the genre, establishing a new era that emphasized storytelling, secondary content, and world-building more than ever before. While not flawless, the 2015 game is arguably timeless, at least up to this point. Hard as it is to believe,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  has been out for nearly a decade, and its shadow continues to loom large over RPGs and even CD Projekt Red specifically.

 <p>
  Due to its popularity and relative accessibility,
  <em>
   Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is probably not a new game for most PS Plus subscribers. Certain projects are so big that they stop being exciting additions to subscription services, simply since most people would already own them. Still, there must be a few exceptions who have never loaded up Geralt's final (full) chapter, and they can now experience the best console iteration since PS Plus Extra has both the PS5 and PS4 versions. They will find an ambitious and (at times) overwhelming open-world RPG with fully realized characters, immersive exploration, rich side quests, and a unique combat system.

  Is this the cutest cult simulator of all time?
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is an unapologetically dark roguelite that follows a Lamb as they diligently work to set the stage for their god's return, a process that involves defeating four bishops, recruiting plenty of followers, and the occasional sacrifice. Roguelikes are a dime-a-dozen nowadays, and the genre can be automatically written off if someone does not see the appeal of endlessly replaying the same loop.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1109} -->

 <p>
  In cases like this, roguelites can act as a fun middle-ground between the replayable nature of roguelikes and more story-driven adventures, and
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  walks this line expertly. While, for the most part, players will revisit the same four (randomly generated) dungeons to try and clear them out and take out their bosses, they will constantly be recruiting new characters for their town/cult, which will further unlock new mechanics and upgrades.

 <p>
  Most importantly,
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is just an absolute sinister delight that revels in macabre imagery and ideas. Along with just being very dark, the humor frequently hits the mark as it constantly pushes the envelope. Furthermore, the gameplay is rock-solid as well, be it the dungeon runs or the town-management aspect. The latter is arguably the best part of the game, as the followers have a ton of personality and evolve alongside the Lamb and cult.

  While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  was the biggest PS Plus game of August 2024, an argument could be made that it was not the most exciting. In a move that was a long time coming, Free Radical Design's
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  trilogy finally made its way to modern systems, with all three PS2 games landing on the PS4 and PS5. These are mostly straight ports of the original versions, and they do show their age in a few ways. However, they are still fantastic console shooters that represent the genre at its early best, especially
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  .

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1127} -->

 <p>
  Both entries are great, and they also shine in somewhat different areas. In terms of pure gunplay,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  is arguably the superior of the two games, and it still sits among the best shooters of all time. Although containing something resembling a plot, the story mode is mostly just a series of extraction-style maps, all of which are well-designed and a blast to master. As the franchise's title suggests, players travel through time, ensuring the stages have quite a bit of variety to them. Co-op is supported as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  has a far more robust and prominent story that creates a cohesive adventure rather than a loosely connected jumble of maps. While not high art, the campaign is fun in the way that a blockbuster can be. The gameplay is quite good, although it is notably less intense and frantic than
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  . Nothing wrong with that, but
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  feels a touch less special in this area.

     The first
     <em>
      TimeSplitters
     </em>
     has charm as well, but it is rightfully overshadowed by both of its sequels. To be clear, the 2000 release is worth a playthrough, as long as newcomers prepare themselves for a somewhat rough experience. Also, its gameplay is not that similar to
     <em>
      TimeSplitters 2

     or
     <em>
      Future Perfect

  While the PlayStation 3 had a somewhat slow start to life, the console bowed out in style. Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a haunting action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with infected creatures. The narrative follows the grizzled Joel and the immune Ellie as they travel across the United States in search of a group rumored to be able to craft a cure.

 <p>
  The journey is tough, brutal, and unforgettable. Both of the main characters undergo a great deal of development, particularly Joel, while
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  raises questions of morality through its ambiguous narrative. Even though PS Plus does not have the PS5 remake, the PS4 remaster of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  holds up well and offers a fantastic means to experience an industry-defining gaming story.

  Kratos' move to Midgard gave developers a chance to shine a spotlight on some different gods, tapping into the deep Scandinavian folklore surrounding the Norse Gods and their mythology. With RPG elements, an incredible story, breathtaking visuals, and some awesome combat mechanics,

  While not unheard of, Day 1 PS Plus arrivals are rare, with most months not featuring this type of release. Consequently, whenever an exception materializes, it is always a cause for celebration; more importantly,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is an exceptional exception. Technically, Mintrocket's indie darling has been around since 2023, but it had to wait until April 16, 2024, to make its PlayStation debut, so it still counts as a Day 1 addition. When this year comes to an end,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will almost certainly be remembered as one of the best PS Plus newcomers.

  Combining restaurant management with fishing, Mintrocket created a package that feels oddly unique, despite sharing similarities with many other projects. As Dave, players have two general responsibilities: catch and serve fish. The former takes up the protagonist's days, forcing him to constantly make trips into an evolving ocean in search of materials that can be used to create sushi at his restaurant. Naturally, the nights are spent running the establishment, making sure that customers are satisfied. While the management aspect is not as deep as some other titles on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  gives players more than enough control to make these segments engaging. However, the fishing element is the game's highlight and adds the most replay value.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is without question the most famous horror franchise in gaming, and it is eternally linked to the PlayStation brand. Premium subscribers can play through a healthy selection of entries from Capcom's license, including classics such as
  <em>
   Resident Evil Code: Veronica X
  </em>
  , polarizing sequels like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , and HD remasters of masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . The Extra tier does not have quite as robust of a catalog, although it includes two notable projects in 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake and its sequel. When the main entries successfully shifted to a first-person perspective with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , some fans might have feared that could spell an end for classic third-person releases; fortunately, Capcom relaxed those anxieties with a couple of stellar remakes.

  2020's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is the weakest of Capcom's modern remakes, although it is still a solid action-horror game that does justice to the classic PS1 original. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is considerably more complete and satisfying, delivering a robust two-protagonist campaign that is consistently intense and terrifying. The controls are immaculate, the visuals are stunning, and the sound design is among the best in the genre – an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is almost the perfect horror game.

  One of the
  <strong>
   best PlayStation Plus games
  </strong>
  to launch on Day 1,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is an inspired Metroidvania with simple but effective controls. For the most part, the game sticks very close to the genre's standard formula of unbound exploration, puzzles, platforming, and the gradual reveal of new items that provide access to different areas; however, Shared Memory succeeded in stitching these well-worn pieces together to create something that feels at least somewhat fresh. A big part of this comes down to
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  's haunting aesthetic and ambient music, which combine to create a campaign oozing in atmosphere and style, making up for a lack of a conventional story.

 <p>
  Although fun, the platforming sections are quite easy, with most of the jumps providing players with plenty of room for error. However,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is still pretty darn difficult due to its puzzles, very open nature, and clever boss fights. The game's brainteasers often require lateral thinking (and clever use of a slink), while the latter could cause players to feel lost on occasion. That said, the in-game map is detailed and useful.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  is among the most high-profile PS5 games available on PS Plus Extra. As a console exclusive, this reveal seemed destined to transpire sooner or later, although almost two years from the game's debut had to pass for this moment to arrive.
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  might very well still be the most beautiful PS5 title on the market, a testament to Insomniac's mastery of technology and talent for creating vibrant and stunning worlds that would not look out of place in a Pixar movie.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  backs up its good looks with fantastic gameplay and an enjoyable story that allows its lovable characters to shine. Although Ratchet and his robotic companion take center stage, they are accompanied by a new playable Lombax in the form of Rivet, who also comes with her own partner. In combat, the characters largely control the same; however, the game does a great job of establishing Rivet's own identity through her personality.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  lives and dies on the strength of its gameplay, and
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  is right up there with the franchise's best efforts. Ratchet and Rivet have access to a wide assortment of fun weapons, all of which serve a purpose within the campaign.

  While not quite as recognizable as Naughty Dog or Insomniac, Housemarque has been producing PlayStation gold for more than a decade, and the studio was even picked up by Sony in 2021.
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  are fantastic and easy recommendations for anyone who enjoys shoot 'em ups or top-down shooters, respectively; however, Housemarque's portfolio seemed to be all leading to one particular project:
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  . Among the first titles to truly showcase the next-generation hardware, the 2021 release is still comfortably among the best PS5 games, even if it comes with a fairly steep learning curve.

  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is a roguelike third-person shooter set on a strange alien planet. As Selene, players will have to make their way through six biomes, all of which are reasonably large, filled with secrets, feature unique enemies, and culminate in spectacular boss fights. Death means returning to the start or the mid-point, depending on how far someone managed to get. As with most roguelikes, players need to find and upgrade their weapons and stats during each run, and things like parasites and artifacts add extra nuance.

 <p>
  While overwhelming at first,
  <em>

  The 2010s was the decade of indie games, so much so that it is near impossible to select the independent scene's crowning achievement for that period. That said,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the top contenders. Inspired by the
  <em>
   Mother
  </em>
  series, Toby Fox's RPG follows a child as they explore the Underground, a seemingly typical monster-filled setting for the genre. Obviously, players can decide to adhere to RPG tradition and massacre everything that moves, but they do not have to do that.
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  does not force anyone to play a certain way, and players can follow a few different routes.

 <p>
  Blending meta-commentary with nuanced world-building and a strong narrative,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is the full package. Anyone remotely interested in RPGs or just gaming in general should give this seminal project a try, and the game's player-driven structure means multiple playthroughs are encouraged.

  While no longer exclusive to PlayStation consoles,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  will always be associated with Sony's brand to an extent. In recent years, Capcom has tried to lower the barrier of entry for the franchise, crafting projects that are more accessible in their opening hours, all the while retaining most of the earlier entries' depth.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is the most beginner-friendly project in the series, and it comes with a short "campaign" that should teach the basics in roughly 10 hours. Just to be clear to people not familiar with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , finishing
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  's village quests and rolling the credits only means they have completed the tutorial. Now, they can focus on working through the Gathering Hub missions as they collect resources to craft better equipment, allowing them to take on harder quests that will reward higher-tier resources. Repeat the cycle until the end of time (or until it becomes dull).

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  has a fairly simple formula, but it is expected to perfection. Lasting less than an hour at most (and usually considerably shorter), quests drop players in open but not massive maps which will have a few major monsters, including that mission's specific target. Players will then have to track down the enemy and slowly whack away at their health, all the while utilizing the tools at their disposal. Eventually, the fun comes in the preparation for each hunt, crafting a loadout designed to fully target a monster's weaknesses while elevating the hunter's strengths.
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has a robust selection of weapon types as well, and they all control differently.

  PS Plus has more than a few Soulslike games, reflecting the genre's explosion in popularity over the last couple of years. In most cases, people's first exposure will be a FromSoftware project, be it
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  . These are all great places to start, but if the introductory game fails to hit the mark with a new player, they might conclude that Soulslikes are just not for them and ignore any releases by other developers. While most titles take heavy inspiration from the
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games, the genre has enough variety to offer genuine alternatives that do their own thing. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games serve as prime examples of Soulslikes with unique identities that set them apart from their contemporaries. The first game is not available on PS Plus, but Sony's subscription service has the (arguably) superior sequel.

  Starting with the most "obvious" distinction,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is predominantly a third-person shooter, although melee weapons are available as secondary options. Players steadily gain access to a respectable selection of hand and long guns, with the latter generally acting as a loadout's main option. While most guns are purchased rather than looted, enemies regularly drop mods and mutators that can be used to modify builds on the fly, providing customization without flooding the inventory.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  's class system is also fantastic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is at its best when played in 3-player co-op, to the point that many of the archetypes (classes) and bosses feel tailor-made for parties rather than solo runners. The latter can pick a class that includes a dog companion, so they have an option; however, they might find the campaign to be quite difficult, even on the lowest challenge level. Still, the gameplay is fun, the build variety is solid, and the world-hopping structure is pretty awesome. The bosses are also awesome, including a few that have an impressive sense of scale.

  80% of PS Plus Premium subscribers will ignore
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  , and they might have no choice since it requires a PS VR2 headset. Consequently, one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus games
  </strong>
  will only be experienced by a very small group of players; however, anyone who has the required hardware should download Cloudhead's project ASAP. Sony has been steadily adding virtual reality games to the service since June 2024, and
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  is currently the top pick in this niche bracket.

  So, what is
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  ? Well, it is basically a modern take on the traditional on-rails shooter format, albeit with a beat thrown in for good measure. Across a series of stages, players will work their way through creative and fairly abstract levels filled with enemies that need to be shot down, all while a song plays in the background. While they don't have to shoot with the rhythm, players earn more points for doing so, and it is just satisfying to pull off.

  Raccoons are one of the easiest animals to hunt in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </em>
  </strong>
  , since they can be found in various locations throughout the game. They are simple targets and move pretty slowly and can be easily spotted due to their distinctive appearance and characteristic shrieks when alerted. Hunting Raccoons in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  is a great way to get resources like fur and meat. If you’re struggling to find Raccoons, read on.

      <title>Best Horror Games Designed Around Co-Op</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While there are all manner of single-player horror games that offer immersive experiences, co-operative horror games are somewhat less common. This is possibly due to the fact that co-operative horror games are arguably less scary, as everything is when beside a friend.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":270} -->

 <p>
  However, there remain a multitude of horror games, especially action-horror games, that manage to maintain a careful combination of terror and multiplayer chaos. Games like
  <em>
   Lethal Company
  </em>
  can be as scary as they are hilarious, while
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  is a lightweight horror game that offers an undemanding cooperative experience that's more widely accessible.

  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  is a co-operative action-horror game that's perfect for fans of horde shooters such as
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  and the classic sci-fi horror franchise,
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  . The loyalty to the source material is admirable, from the visuals down to the sound design, making
  <em>
   Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  a more than suitable game for groups that enjoyed James Cameron's
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The classic horde-shooter gameplay may be fairly standard, but it's elevated by the addition of online co-op and the immersive
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  packaging. Players that dislike the third-person perspective, however, may prefer first-person horde shooters such as
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  .

  This horror-infused first-person extraction shooter can be played solo, but it's clearly been designed to play with one or two friends. Playing in a team gives players a better chance of survival, and the more pairs of eyes searching the brush for danger the better.

  <em>

  This asymmetric multiplayer horror game pits one player, the killer, against several others, the survivors. This gameplay loop is intentionally reminiscent of a classic slasher film, and although it's a match-based versus game, the survivors must work cooperatively in order to escape.

  A solid strategy, map knowledge, and teamwork are integral to success in

  , making it a title that's perfect for co-op. However, some players may get frustrated by having to rely heavily on their teammates.

  Although
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  can be played in single-player, it's arguably at its best when playing in online co-op, which allows for up to four players. The combination of standard gunplay and simplistic hack-and-slash combat is at first an unremarkable experience, but the RPG elements and strong multiplayer capabilities elevate the overall package.

  <em>

  is a hardcore first-person horror shooter that challenges players at every turn. The game's gritty tone and dark, atmospheric 3D environments offer a unique flavor, but

 <p>
  In the game, players make their way through underground environments in a gameplay loop that combines stealth and strategy with fluid gunplay.
  <em>
   GTFO
  </em>
  is designed with four-player co-op in mind, and although it allows players to fill their line-up with AI bots if need be, it's clearly been designed with human teams in mind.

  <em>
   Lethal Company
  </em>
  is a co-operative sci-fi horror game designed with terror, comedy, and chaos in mind. The game tasks players with delving into dangerous facilities infested with an ensemble of horrific creatures, collecting as many valuables as they can in order to meet their company quota.

  Teamwork is essential to success in
  <em>
   Lethal Company
  </em>
  , as players are much more likely to survive in numbers. However, the main reason to play
  <em>
   Lethal Company
  </em>
  with friends is that it's simply a lot more fun, especially when making use of the game's proximity voice chat.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  could be seen as somewhat of an exaggerated mess, emphasizing action over horror with a heavy hand and carrying players through a story that's even more B-movie than its predecessors. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  is arguably one of the best co-op horror games, packed with action and moments that are all the more memorable with a friend.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  was clearly designed with co-op in mind, as the game's AI partner leaves something to be desired, often making the experience a frustrating one. Playing with a friend, however, removes the frustration and replaces it with a focus on teamwork, making
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  rather rewarding to play cooperatively.

  Certainly not the most horrifying game out there,
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  is a decidedly action-oriented experience. However, the unpredictable AI Director and the dense atmosphere of its diverse environments provide the perfect level of tension, easily broken by the chaos of co-operative gameplay and the B-movie dialogue of the protagonists.

  <em>

  can be played in single-player with AI squad-mates, but it was clearly designed with multiplayer in mind. Teamwork is essential to success, especially on harder difficulties, and players will often be reliant on their teammates to prevent the various special infected from taking them down.

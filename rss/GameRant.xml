  Exploring the exciting new lands in Dawntrail, the upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  expansion, is thirsty work. It's always important to stay hydrated while gaming, especially during the rush to play through ten new levels and a hundred or so new Main Scenario Quests. Thankfully, a new crossover event will give gamers an important reason to reach for Mountain Dew while they make their way to the new continent of Tural.

  During last month's 81st Letter From the Producer Live broadcast,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  announced a partnership with Mountain Dew Gaming. Players based in the United States can earn exclusive FFXIV x Mtn Dew rewards for digital in-game items, including the Sparkling Citrus Refreshment consumable, and real life merch, like apparel and collectables. The biggest prize, though, is the Mountain Zu mount.

  The Mountain Dew Gaming website offers a bit of background lore for this new item. While trying to tame one of these grumpy birds, Hannish alchemists fed it a special new brew. Not only did it calm the beast â€” it also made the zu give off a "refreshing citrus aroma." If only Mountain Dew had such powers outside of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV
  </em>
  ! Perhaps its fragrance will help it rank among the most popular mounts in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  . You'll need to earn Mountain Dew Gaming Points, however.

  Earn Mountain Dew Gaming points by buying one of the specially marked soda bottles. Some of the more esoteric Mountain Dew flavors offer an extra bonus. The promotional flavors exclusively carried in Walmart, Dollar General, Circle K, and Casey's are worth twice as many points as the standard Dew flavors carried everywhere.

  <em>

    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  is well known for a wide variety of reasons, whether it's the game's impressive bosses and raids, incredibly generous free trial, or the ability to play through the story completely solo, but one niche that may not always receive the spotlight it deserves is the game's fully fleshed out crafting and gathering systems. Complete with a robust set of abilities and diverse array of equipment, crafting and gathering in
  <em>

  One example of this depth is the
  <strong>
   Ishgardian Restoration
  </strong>
  , a permanent hub for crafters and gatherers dedicated to repairing the major city of Ishgard in exchange for special rewards and achievements, including mounts, minions, titles, and cosmetic armor. While the Ishgardian Restoration previously featured ranked leaderboards and awarded players at the top with an exclusive title and achievement, it now serves as a streamlined method for players to quickly progress their crafters and gatherers to level 80 while building toward unique rewards.

  <strong>
   Towards the Firmament
  </strong>
  " offered by a
  <strong>
   Recruitment Notice in Foundation (X:9.7, Y:11.5)
  </strong>
  . Once completed, players will be able to access the Firmament, the main hub of the Ishgardian Restoration where all related services can be found, such as NPCs to turn in gathered and crafted items, exchange scrips for items, participate in periodic fÃªtes, or play the Kupo of Fortune mini-game.

  Participation in any Ishgardian Restoration by crafting or gathering will provide players with Skybuilders' Scrips, a currency unique to the Ishgardian Restoration used to purchase various items and rewards, such as mounts, minions, emotes, and cosmetic armor for glamouring. These items can all be exchanged for by speaking with
  <strong>
   Enie in The Firmament (X:12, Y:14)
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The periodically occurring fÃªtes found in the Firmament also grant players an opportunity to earn rewards, granting FÃªte Tokens and FÃªtes Presents rather than Skybuilders' Scrips to players that participate. Like Skybuilders' Scrips, FÃªte Tokens can be exchanged with
  <strong>
   Enie in The Firmament (X:12, Y:14)
  </strong>
  for exclusive rewards, including the Antelope Stag mount and Peacelover's Attire set, which can only be naturally obtained via fÃªtes. FÃªtes Presents function much like a loot box, granting players a randomly selected reward when opened, including the previously mentioned mount and cosmetic armor.

  Gathering in the Ishargian Restoration takes place in a dedicated zone, the newly repurposed Diadem, which can be accessed by speaking to
  <strong>
   Aurvael in The Firmament (X:10.8, Y:14.0)
  </strong>
  as a Disciple of the Land of at least level 10. Once inside the Diadem, players will be able to gather from any of the available nodes or fish from bodies of water to obtain Skybuilders' materials that are used exclusively for the Ishgardian Restoration. As they gather materials, the compressed aether gauge will gradually fill up, allowing players to use the Aetheromatic Auger duty action. While normally unsuited for combat, the Aetheromatic Auger allows gatherers to instantly defeat a targeted enemy, granting them a burst of Skybuilders' materials based on the type of enemy defeated.

  Once players have gathered all the materials they need, they can submit their items for inspection
  <strong>
   back in The Firmament
  </strong>
  by speaking with
  <strong>
   Flotpassant (X:10.8, Y:14)
  </strong>
  . The inspection process converts the gathered materials into approved versions of the same item and rewards players with Skybuilders' Scrips and Skyward Points that count towards the Skyward series of achievements for the corresponding gathering job. These approved materials can then be used to craft Skybuilder's items or traded and sold to other players.

 <p>
  Crafting for the Ishgardian Restoration works much the same as crafting collectable items, with the Quality gauge increasing the item's Collectability rather than its high-quality chance. Crafting an item with a higher tier of Collectability increases the amount of Skybuilders' Scrips, experience, and Skyward Points received, making it worthwhile for crafters to consider pursuing quality over quantity. In addition, every Skybuilder crafter recipe used for the Ishgaridan Restoration makes use of one or more approved Skybuilders' material, as well as one material from the open world, making it mandatory for crafters to either gather items from the Diadem themselves, or purchase these materials from other players via the market board.

  Once crafted, Skybuilders' items can be submitted to
  <strong>
   Potkin in The Firmament (X:12.2, Y:14.6)
  </strong>
  , earning experience, Skybuilders' Scrips, Skyward Points, and a Kupo Stamp towards a Kupo Voucher, with every five stamps earning a Kupo Voucher which can be spent with
  <strong>
   Lizbeth in the Firmament (X:12.2, Y:14.6)

 <p>
  Every Kupo of Fortune card features a randomized set of rewards spread across five tiers of rarity. A single hex on the left can only win an item from the lowest four tiers, meaning players will have a higher chance to win each individual tier at the cost of being unable to win the jackpot prize. Conversely, the remaining three hexes on the right have a reduced total chance to roll the bottom four tiers of rewards, but instead gives players a small opportunity to win the first tier prize.

 <p>
  In addition to the regular Skybuilders' recipes, each crafting job includes an expert recipe, making use of the special umbral Skybuilders' materials. Unlike regular recipes, expert recipes are often significantly more difficult to complete and are unable to activate the rare Excellent or Poor conditions, and they prevent the use of the level 80 crafter action,
  <strong>
   Trained Eye
  </strong>
  , which instantly maxes out the Quality gauge of an item 10 or more levels below the player. In exchange, expert recipes introduce various special crafting conditions that change the behavior of crafting actions beyond improving quality. The full list of these special crafting conditions includes:

 <p>
  While players can make these recipes easier to complete by leveling beyond the recipe level of 80, expert recipes require significantly more steps to complete each craft while not significantly increasing the number of Skybuilders' Scrips received compared to a maxed out level 80 regular recipe. Instead, expert recipes provide the most of its benefits in the amount of Skyward Points they yield. As a result,
  <strong>
   expert recipes are only recommended for players chasing after the Skyward series of achievements for each crafting job
  </strong>
  . Players more concerned with leveling their crafters and earning Skybuilders' Scrips should instead focus on submitting the more quickly completed regular recipes instead â€” at least until crafters' stats are high enough to complete expert crafting recipes in a similarly short amount of time.

  Developer Mobius Digital has officially closed the door on significant post-launch development on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Outer Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  , its award-winning exploration game. The studio deployed a new patch for
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  and its
  <em>
   Echoes of the Eye
  </em>
  expansion on all platforms, and reiterated that no further "major" updates will be coming to the game.

 <p>
  First released in 2019,
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  cast players as an explorer in a quaint and peaceful space program. It sent them around a tiny, hand-crafted solar system in search of the solution to a strange mystery: a time loop that resets the system every 22 minutes, when the sun explodes and destroys everything. With time as the main antagonist in
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  , the game challenged players to gather clues in the brief period before the supernova and use the knowledge gained to solve further mysteries in the next loop. The game would go on to win awards at the 2020 BAFTA Games Awards, the Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, and secure praise from critics and players. Mobius Digital released the more horror-themed
  <em>
   Echoes of the Eye
  </em>
  expansion in 2021.

 <p>
  Now, Mobius Digital has closed the cycle on
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  for good, five years past its original release. In its patch notes for the latest update, which brings the game up to Patch 15 on PC, Xbox and PlayStation and Patch 4 on Switch, the studio said that Patch 4 is the last major patch planned for the Switch version of the game. The Switch edition of
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  launched in December 2023, with the
  <em>
   Echoes of the Eye
  </em>
  expansion available as an additional purchase.

 <p>
  For all versions of
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  , the latest patch adds a new feature requested by a very small minority of players: The ability to invert the X-axis controls for moving and camera operation. The X-axis is the horizontal axis, meaning that when toggled, the inversion will cause a push on the stick to the left to move the character or the camera to the right, and vice versa. Inverting the Y-axis is a common accessibility feature, but requests to invert the X-axis are much rarer. Mobius Digital wished 18 players "and Jeff," who sent "very impassioned emails" well for requesting the feature, and hoped they enjoy their "topsy-turvy world."

 <p>
  On PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, the patch fixed some issues with achievements, made it harder to accidentally die in some locations, and fixed issues with things like collisions and UI bugs, as well as improving the functionality of the PS5 DualSense controller on PC. On Switch, the patch brought numerous fixes to the game's visuals, some reported bugs, and improved performance in various areas. Mobius Digital said that while smaller updates might still be deployed for
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Echoes of the Eye
  </em>
  , it could not guarantee that it would have the time available. Years after creating one of the most rewarding exploration games of all time, the studio is moving on to new projects.

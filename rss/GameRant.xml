   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater
   </strong>
  </em>
  retains the original identity of Kojima's
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
  </em>
  with every pixel. Design, characters, and gameplay are all near-identical, albeit with a modern uplift. With such identical renditions, it's expected of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater
  </em>
  to have the same easter eggs as the original, but that doesn't make them any less cool. Below, players can take a look at some of the best easter eggs and secrets in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater
  </em>
  , along with how to find them in their own game and what makes them so cool to witness first-hand.

  When Snake infiltrates a research facility in search of Sokolov, he comes across Granin, a proud man who scoffs at Sokolov's creation. Grainin's dreams are grandiose and entirely dangerous. Once Snake meets him, they can investigate his office with their own eyes, where they will see statues of Metal Gears yet to be created, like Metal Gear Ray. There are also blueprints to other Metal Gears, but even more alarming is a photo of Granin with his American ally, Huey Emmerich. Not only is this the father of Otacon, but it's the man who helped craft the Metal Gears, and someone who Big Boss would eventually have a complicated alliance in later years.

  Once players reach their holding cell after a cutscene in Volgin's torture room, they will be stuck until they find a way to escape. However, feel free to linger a little while longer, as the lone guard will occasionally throw food into the cell. If Snake equips the food from his backpack and throws it out of his cell 3 times, the guard will talk to Snake and begin a secret cutscene where he reveals his origin as an American with a wife and kid. This man reveals himself to be Johnny, and then reveals that the firstborn sons in his family are all called Johnny. His father's a Johnny, his son's a Johnny, and his son's son will be a Johnny. This rings true, for every game in the series features a character called Johnny who defecates at inappropriate times, providing some light-hearted toilet humor.

  Players can learn a little bit more about Snake when they enter his prison cell after being tortured by Volgin. All they need to do is call the Para-Medic's save codec, where she will begin to talk about the vampire Dracula. Snake is revealed to be terrified of vampires, and if players reload the save they just created, they will be loaded into an entirely separate game, referred to as Guy Savage. This mode is completely separate from what's been played before, and has players take on a hack-and-slash adventure against vampires and coffin monsters. The gameplay is a lot of fun, so it's definitely worth trying out for players who have yet to experience the truth of Snake's Nightmare.

  There are clever ways to torture Snake that don't have direct impacts on his health and create a game-over paradox. Players can actually make Snake vomit if they enter the Cure menu and decide to spin him with the analog stick for over 10 times. The same can be done once players have EVA as an ally in the final segments of the game. Not only can players force Snake to puke up his dinner, but they can also make him catch the common cold by having him stand in the rain or water for around 30 minutes while in his Naked camouflage, which will see him sneeze and sniffle.

  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 2
  </em>
  might be beloved now, but the game's release in 2001 saw some controversy with its subversion of expectations. The protagonist of
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  was not the beloved Solid Snake, but instead a new character, Raiden, whom most players at the time saw as whiny and annoying. With
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  coming soon after, the developers realized people's lack of love for Raiden, and decided to make fun of him by making Raikov look identical to Raiden. In the locker where players hide Raikov's body, is also a poster of MGS2 with Raiden on the cover, and selecting "I love
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  !" before the game starts, Snake will be wearing a Raiden mask.

  The End is the greatest sniper to have ever lived, and his 100+ years on this Earth prove just that. However, Snake can commit some forms of elder abuse if he so feels like it. The first time players meet the End, he's in his wheelchair. Players can use a weapon to kill the End early in this segment before he escapes, which will result in no boss fight, and Snake getting his by a wheelchair's rogue exploding wheel. That's not all players can do, as even in the End's boss fight, they can eat his loyal parrot, hold him up for a unique camouflage, or save the game in his boss fight, skip time for a week, and then return to find his corpse where he would've died from old age.

  In order to rescue Sokolov in the latter half of the game, players will need to kidnap Major Raikov and use a disguise to look exactly like him. While Colonel Volgin sees through this disguise because of the size of Snake's crotch not being the same as Raikov's, it seems that Volgin isn't able to use the same crotch-grabbing tactic in the middle of a battle. If players re-equip the Raikov disguise during the Volgin boss fight, Volgin will drop to his knees and mourn for his lover. It's a fun easter egg that not only allows players to get in some free and cheap damage, but also shows the deeper secrets to manipulate boss fights.

  In one of the final cutscenes of the game, players can hit R1 while being greeted by the U.S. President to look to the left, where Snake's eye will spot Revolver Ocelot, shooting them one last point to prove that he's everywhere. Not only is this a fun and creepy easter egg, but it also shows deeper meaning within Ocelot's importance. Ocelot truly is everywhere, and his actions as a triple agent couldn't be clearer as he stalks Big Boss from the shadows. For future entries, this easter egg shows how deeply Ocelot respects Snake, and how he would be his most loyal soldier from here on out.

      <title>Schedule 1 Players Can Once Again Vote on the Game's Next Update</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/schedule-1-community-vote-new-update-august-2025/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  After the recent launch of the title's big cartel patch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Schedule 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer TVGS is once again allowing players to vote for the game's next major content update. The first
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  community vote gave players the opportunity to choose between three update options: the cartel, shrooms, or a police expansion. As players will be well aware, the cartel update emerged victorious, but now it's time for the community to decide which content should be added next.

  Alongside titles such as
  <em>
   R.E.P.O
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Peak
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  has cemented itself as one of the biggest indie games of the year. In its first few days, the crime simulation title reached a peak of nearly 460,000 concurrent players on Steam, making it one of the most popular games on the platform. Since then,
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  has received a steady stream of new updates from its solo developer, Tyler, to keep players engaged. The latest patch was only released just a few days ago, but the dev is now once again calling on players to decide what
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  's next update should be.

  Schedule 1 Players Can Vote for the Game's Next Update
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  's cartel update was highly requested by players in the first community vote, and it's now time for fans to choose what should be added to the game next. In a new post on Steam, TVGS has revealed that the second community vote is now live until the weekend. Once again, players will be able to vote for one of three new updates via the
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  main menu. This time around, the community will be voting between hireable drivers, fishing, and shrooms. The latter of which was previously available in the first community vote earlier this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players choose to vote for hireable drivers, the update will add a new employee to
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  that can transport items between a player's properties, businesses, and dealers. Players will also be able to designate automatic transit routes and specify the required conditions, such as the number of items in the vehicle, for a route to begin. As for fishing, the update will add a new minigame where players can reel in fish and sell them at Randy's Bait &amp; Tackle. TVGS says the update would also add several new ingredients and effects to the game.

  Out of the main digital platforms, the PlayStation Store has the best range of
  <strong>
   JRPG deals
  </strong>
  for this week, covering quite a few major franchises and subgenres. While perhaps not as well-known as some other IPs,
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes
  </em>
  is generally regarded as one of the most consistent JRPG series of all time, and pretty much all the franchise's recent releases are on sale. A couple of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games are discounted, including the PS4's
  <em>
   X/X-2 HD Remaster
  </em>
  compilation. If you have never played those turn-based classics and want to buy something that will keep you busy for quite a long time, this deal is worth checking out. Alternatively, you can just get
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Two of the best JRPGs of 2024,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  , are as cheap as they have ever been on the PS5, and they are both lengthy and ambitious masterpieces. For anyone craving a dungeon crawler,
  <em>
   Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society
  </em>
  is a great option. Tactics fans can check out
  <em>
   Disgaea
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The DioField Chronicle
  </em>
  .

  At the moment, the Xbox Store's JRPG sales selection is a bit lacking, as most deals are set to expire by the end of September 1. Microsoft might reveal new discounts after that point, but that is not guaranteed. We also have no way to know if JRPGs will be included.

  Switch owners are eating well this week, at least if their preferred meal involves JRPGs. While no native Switch 2 JRPGs are discounted, many of its predecessor's titles are on sale, and they should be playable on the newer system.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of subgenres, turn-based JRPGs deals are plentiful, with
  <em>
   Persona 3 Portable
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei V
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster
  </em>
  being some of the highlights. If you are more into action JRPGs, you can pick up multiple
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  games, along with
  <em>
   Tokyo Xanadu eX+
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ys VIII
  </em>
  , and even some
  <em>
   Sword Art Online
  </em>
  titles.

  Steam and sales are synonymous, with Valve's store nearly always promoting a few substantial deals. Currently, Steam's JRPG deals are pretty solid, although they are not particularly plentiful. Many of Atlus' games will be on sale until September 4, and they are consistently high quality.
  <em>
   Granblue Fantasy: Relink
  </em>
  was one of the best action JRPGs of 2024, and
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  is one of the best action JRPGs of 2025.
  <em>
   Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
  </em>
  is also on sale, although it is only 10% cheaper than usual. While only inspired by JRPGs, the 2025 game is so beloved that we just have to mention it.

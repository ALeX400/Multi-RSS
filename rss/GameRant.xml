      <title>Best RPGs On PlayStation Plus, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  Rising out of PS Now's ashes, Sony's new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  rolled out in 2022, and it has been a reasonable success by all accounts. Split into three tiers, the service's Extra and Premium subscriptions grant users access to hundreds of games covering a wide spectrum of genres. Yearning for a fright? PS Plus has plenty of horror delights. Want to play with a friend? Local co-op options are not lacking.

  Unsurprisingly, role-playing games are not an exception, and that includes Western and Japanese projects. PS Plus has action, turn-based, shooter, open-world, and tactical RPGs, so there should be something for just about everyone. As the service's library is so vast, here is a rundown of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus RPGs
  </strong>
  , along with a few genre classics that are available as part of the Premium tier.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated January 19, 2025 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   PS Plus Extra and Premium's January 2025 lineup includes a few RPGs, and they will be available from the 21st. Two of these upcoming titles have been added as recommendations.

     As not everything is included with a PS Plus Extra subscription, each entry states whether the game is part of that tier. Each game's average length is based on their main story average on HowLongToBeat.

  Added in time for the sequel,
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper
  </em>
  is a brilliant title for PS Plus Extra. Not only is it a great RPG, but it is also a unique RPG that can scratch a different itch to all the open-world, action, and traditional turn-based games that populate the subscription service. That said,
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper
  </em>
  is one of those projects that can be hard to appreciate or "get" without hands-on experience, and PS Plus removes the risk associated with taking a gamble on an unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cast as a human brain in a robot body, players have escaped from the watchful eye of the corporation that owns them, and they must now try to settle down while keeping a low profile. Rather than combat,
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper
  </em>
  focuses on NPC interactions, day planning, time management, and dice rolls. Taking a few ideas from visual novels, the game focuses heavily on dialogue and player choice, all the while injecting randomness by determining the outcome of events through dice. The latter showcases
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper
  </em>
  's tabletop influence, while the visuals showcase a love for sci-fi and cyberpunk classics.

  Deck13's
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  garnered a decisively mixed reception when it debuted in 2023, which might have put off a few people who were initially interested in checking out the action RPG. Fortunately, PS Plus should help reduce that trepidation, lowering the bar to justify a download. Now,
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  has gone through quite a few changes since its debut, and it is not the same game it was back in 2023. "Reign of Sand" refers to a significant post-launch update that added New Game+, more enemies (a point of contention with the vanilla version), new voice acting, new Wraith abilities, and even a new area.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not perfect, the current version is more well-rounded and consistent than the original iteration, presenting a campaign that has considerably more variety. Just to be clear, the vanilla version of
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  already had decent combat (with a pretty unique momentum system), pretty visuals, and satisfying movement that made traversing the open-world fun, so it was hardly without positives. Now, it is just better.

     Deck13 is mostly known for
     <em>
      The Surge
     </em>
     games, but
     <em>
      Atlas Fallen
     </em>
     is not a Souls-like RPG. The combat is considerably more fast-paced and has an almost hack-and-slash feel.

  CD Projekt Red's
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  was one of the biggest and most important RPGs of the 2010s, and its brilliance has not faded at all over the last 10 years.

 <p>
  Bringing to a close Geralt's final run as the main protagonist, the 2015 game is the definition of a dark fantasy epic, delivering immersive storytelling that translates into a living and breathing world. Although the main story is well-told and engaging,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  shines in its secondary content, particularly its side quests and activities like Gwent. The former arguably still represents the peak in both the open-world and RPG genres, while the latter is just a fun and deep mini-game that can take hours of a player's life.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's legacy is set in stone and there is nothing new that can be said to convince a newcomer to give it a try. Ultimately, the game is not perfect: the combat is polarizing, Geralt's horse can be unwieldy, and the main villains are somewhat underwhelming. However, as a full package,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's ambition shines through its impressive world, fully realized characters, and robust range of monster designs.

  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Bram Stoker, and other classical horror authors of the early 20th century. It is developed by FromSoftware, the same studio behind the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  franchise and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  was released as a PlayStation exclusive, though, and is included with PS Plus Premium and Extra. It's one of the most challenging RPGs ever made, and its uniquely disturbing visuals paired with incredibly fine-tuned gameplay make it a classic every PlayStation owner should try at some point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is very much a Soulslike, which is basically a separate genre by this point. However, the vast majority of these releases are, ultimately, action RPGs that combine build variety, customization, deep progression systems, and loot. Compared to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  does not emphasize weapon drops all that much, instead opting for a smaller pool of viable options that each have multiple forms and play very differently from each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly, this Victorian Gothic masterpiece delivers an immersive setting, challenging but fair combat, epic boss fights, and fantastic lore (that can be ignored if a player simply does not care).

  <em>

  is unlike pretty much any other
  <strong>
   PS Plus RPG
  </strong>
  , and this uniqueness might put off some people if they go in completely blind. However, the latter will result in a better experience since this is one adventure that should not be spoiled as much as possible. Basically, ZA/UM created a game that revolves heavily around dialogue, which acts as a replacement for a combat system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will spend most of their playthrough reading text or listening to the (well-done) voice acting, to the point that
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  can feel like a visual novel at times. Throughout these sections, players will regularly have to make choices that impact not only the overall story but also the protagonist's personality and ideology.

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series has remained somewhat stagnant since the release of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  almost eight years ago. Fans hold out for the eventual sequel to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , though, thanks to the everlasting playability of the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  is the game that popularized
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series before
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  made it a household name.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the graphics may feel dated nowadays,
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  's story, gameplay, and overall atmosphere are still as impressive as they were on release. The music of the game is regularly praised as the best in the series, and the environments of Cyrodiil are as lush as they are teeming with secrets. If someone has only ever played
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , they will like its predecessor too.

  Even if it does not have
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's name recognition,
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  is a huge deal in the Japanese RPG world, particularly when it comes to real-time combat. Except for maybe
  <em>
   Star Ocean
  </em>
  , Bandai Namco's series is the definitive action JRPG franchise, a reputation forged from decades of solid releases. While everyone has their favorites (
  <em>
   Tales of Graces f
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Abyss
  </em>
  are fantastic in certain areas),
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  represent
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  ' peak(s), and they are quite different experiences in their own right. Fortunately, all three titles are available on PS Plus Premium, with
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  also being part of the Extra tier. Although probably the most "classic" entry in the series,
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  shows its age in many places, and the remastered version barely tries to remedy that. Just to be clear, the game is still worth playing, but someone's mileage will likely vary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite originally launching in 2008,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  is far more accessible in this day and age, and the Definitive Edition lives up to its title. This project came out at a time when the franchise was transitioning to a full 3D battle system, and while simple compared to subsequent entries,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  's combat is still fun for the most part. The story is slow to get going but transforms into something fantastic once it picks up momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, there is
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  , the most modern release in the series (not counting remasters). Complete newcomers who are not sure which game to start with should pick
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  as it is the most well-rounded option on PS Plus, delivering good combat, visuals, characters, and storytelling. That said,
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  does not support co-op, which is otherwise considered a staple of the franchise. Therefore,
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  would be better options for a group of players.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the RPG genre, and the 1997 game holds up after all these years. That classic is without question one of the
  <strong>
   best JRPGs on PS Plus
  </strong>
  , however, the same claim can also be made regarding its remake. Square Enix has opted to retell this iconic story through a modern lens, one that provides a lot more than just a graphical upgrade. Utilizing an action-based battle system with a couple of turn-based options,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade
  </em>
  delivers fast-paced and addictive combat across a plethora of playable characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Intergrade
  </em>
  is the PS5 version that includes Yuffie's "Intermission" DLC, and it is a substantial addition that features unique bosses and mechanics. The PS4 vanilla version of the game is also on PS Plus Premium and Extra, so a subscriber does not need Sony's latest console to play this title. As Square Enix has announced that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , the second part of the remake initiative, is on the way, this is the perfect time for newcomers to jump into the first game.

  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  was a pleasant surprise as the JRPG genre does not frequently produce new IPs with relatively big budgets, particularly ones that garner a positive reception. Bandai's game takes place in an alternate reality where empowered humans are tasked with fighting off threats known as the Others. Players can pick from two protagonists, both of whom have different combat styles and storylines. While there is a fair amount of overlap, two playthroughs are required to experience the full story.
 </p>
 <p>
  The action JRPG plays out like a hack and slash game akin to something like the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series, although players cannot swap between their party members. The combat system is fast-paced, flashy, and surprisingly deep, even if it takes a while to unveil all of its mechanics. Narratively,
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  is also a success, and the game leaves enough room for a potential sequel. While it might not have the name recognition of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  is one of the
  <strong>

  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  is among the most important RPG franchises of all time, largely thanks to the brilliant original game that helped set the standard for immersive sims. The sequels are all over the place in terms of quality, but
  <em>
   Human Revolution
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mankind Divided
  </em>
  are at least good enough to proudly carry the license's name. The latter finds Adam Jensen infiltrating a secret organization responsible for a string of terrorist attacks. Narratively,
  <em>
   Mankind Divided
  </em>
  hits the mark and delivers a captivating tale with interesting and relevant themes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Deux Ex
  </em>
  is synonymous with player choice, something reflected by the 2016 release. Adam can approach scenarios in a variety of ways; players can opt for stealth or blast every enemy in sight. Although the game does somewhat advise players to try and keep a low profile, it does not significantly punish those who prefer to treat the campaign like a first-person shooter. Choices also impact the progression of missions, which means players will want to at least play through the story twice to get the full experience.

   PS Plus RPGs
  </strong>
  received a decent boost in July 2024 thanks to the arrival of
  <em>
   Crisis Core – Final Fantasy 7 – Reunion
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Summoner
  </em>
  . All those titles are worth playing depending on someone's preferences, but the month's biggest addition was undoubtedly
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , Gunfire's 2023 entry in the Soulslike subgenre. While these types of games are almost regarded as separate entities from RPGs, they are still ultimately part of the genre and include nearly all the fundamentals associated with it.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  offers a range of classes (aka Archetypes), build variety, quests, exploration, fairly deep lore, and a serviceable story to follow. Anyone familiar with
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  should know what to expect from the sequel, albeit with most of its ideas expanded and improved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Focusing on third-person shooter gunplay and mostly limiting melee to a secondary option,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  grants players quite a few options in how they want to approach the action. While initially only presenting a few Archetypes, new ones are unlocked throughout the campaign, and they all have different perks, skills, and traits that set them apart. Beyond this element, equipment like mods and mutators provide quite a bit of flexibility, and the same can be said for weapons (although they are not extremely plentiful or frequent drops). As a single-player experience,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  gets the job done; however, the game is clearly designed with co-op in mind.

  A cult PS1 classic,
  <em>
   The Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  debuted late in the console's lifespan, limiting its reach and potential. Nowadays, this JRPG is rather difficult to find, especially since the project was never ported to any other systems. Consequently, its addition to PS Plus Premium is a big deal since it marks the first time in a long while that this fan-favorite is widely accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  is similar to other 3D JRPGs released during the late-'90s such as Square's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  entries. The game features turn-based combat, random enemy encounters, and a lengthy storyline. Although not far removed from its contemporaries,
  <em>
   Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  introduced a range of unique ideas, including input prompts during battle.

  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  has quite a mixed reputation, most of which can be traced back to its buggy launch. Since then, Techland has released a lot of updates that provide a far smoother experience; while not 100% perfect, it is nowadays in a much better state. Important as they are, the technical aspects ultimately do not determine whether a game is actually fun or not, and
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  has always been pretty entertaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  An open-world romp set during a zombie apocalypse, the game is largely beloved for its gameplay, specifically free-running. Building on the ideas of its predecessor, the sequel really emphasizes its parkour, encouraging players to be constantly on the move as they explore Villedor during both the day and night. The story is nothing to write home about, and neither is the protagonist, but the minute-to-minute gameplay routine more than makes up for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, none of that stuff has anything to do with the RPG genre.
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  is one of those releases that features RPG elements but is not necessarily defined by them. Players level up, equip class-specific weapons and armor, unlock and improve their abilities, complete missions and side quests, and even make the occasional decision that impacts the world and the story's ending. The game has more than enough ingredients to qualify as an RPG, but the combat and movement are by fair its best features.

  A PlayStation 2 classic,
  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  is a charming JRPG that has aged beautifully over the last two decades. As Max and Monica, players explore dungeons in search of items that allow them and their village to grow. Rather than leveling up the protagonists,
  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  ties progression to weapons; the more a sword or gun is used, the stronger it becomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level-5's portfolio is filled with great JRPGs, but even in that competitive scene,
  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  still manages to stand out as being something extra special. This PS2 title is one of the

  has been a staple of the action JRPG scene for decades, particularly on PCs. Although not the first entry to garner attention in Western countries,
  <em>
   Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana
  </em>
  helped expand the franchise's visibility since it features graphics that did not look as dated as its predecessors' visuals. More importantly, the action JRPG has a fast-paced and awesome combat system that is accessible but also hides a fair amount of depth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set on a reasonably sized island filled with monsters to slay and discoveries to be made,
  <em>

  Role-playing titles can be stressful, both in terms of their narratives and gameplay. For people who want something a touch more relaxing and laid-back,
  <em>
   Moonlighter

  is a valid option. The game is split into two sections: shop management and dungeon crawling. The latter serves as a way to acquire resources and loot that can be invested in the former.
 </p>
 <p>
  This loop is addictive and rewarding, while still offering enough of a challenge to test players.
  <em>

  PS Plus has all the 3D
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games, including
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  for those craving a multiplayer experience. Focusing on the main single-player entries, all three RPGs have their positives that make them worthwhile. Now, Extra tier subscribers just have
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , so they don't have much of an option. While somewhat divisive due to its restrictive RPG and dialogue mechanics, the 2015 sequel is arguably the most enjoyable from a minute-to-minute perspective, providing relatively decent gunplay and gameplay compared to its predecessors.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most iconic entry in the franchise,
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  is an accessible but still deep RPG with a good story and a great sandbox that encourages and rewards exploration. Finally,
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  is arguably the best all-around
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  game, and it has aged well as long as new players are prepared for a few bugs and rough moments. In terms of pure role-playing,
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  is a masterpiece.

  Most
  <strong>
   PS Plus RPGs
  </strong>
  are long and epic journeys that can take months to complete, and they are great. That said, exceptions exist, and
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  might be the best. Sony's service has the first two entries in the series, which are very similar while still containing a few twists that set them apart from each other. Newcomers might be tempted to jump directly into the sequel to just go with the most recent option, which would be fine since neither game is so story-heavy that a lack of content would be an issue; however, doing this would mean missing out on a cute and fun action RPG. More importantly, it is very possible to complete both games in less than 20 hours, so there is no reason to skip an entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Played from an isometric perspective,
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  streamlines the action RPG/dungeon-crawler formula to create an accessible but still reasonably challenging experience. The combat is simple but satisfying, while the progression and customization systems provide just enough options to warrant trying out different builds. Both titles are set in delightful open-worlds that manage to feel expansive despite their relatively small sizes. While the first game is single-player only, the sequel integrates co-op directly into the story through the usage of two protagonists who are forced to work together.

      <title>Street Fighter 6: What Mai's Gameplay Trailer Reveals About the Character</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/street-fighter-6-mai-gameplay-reveal-dlc-expectations-future/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is well into Year 2 of its DLC. With M. Bison and Terry Bogard receiving varying levels of warm reception, the community has naturally been looking forward to the game's next character. With Mai Shiranui right around the corner,
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  fans should be on the lookout for a few things.
 </p>

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Mai Shiranui joins Terry Bogard as the first pair of guest characters to ever join
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  . Just like Terry, Mai Shiranui happens to hail from
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  and has made plenty of appearances throughout
  <em>
   The King of Fighters
  </em>
  franchise. Although these are two classic fighting game franchises, there are bound to be plenty of people in
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  's broader audience who may not be familiar with Mai.

 <h3 id="mai-shiranui-39-s-street-fighter-6-gameplay-could-burn-bright">
  Mai Shiranui's Street Fighter 6 Gameplay Could Burn Bright
 </h3>
 <p>
  Gameplay is often one of the biggest ways for guest characters to stand out. Terry Bogard was certainly no different, taking inspiration from
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  's own lane system to craft an incredibly unique design. Although Terry's viability has often been in question, the creativity of his moveset has left many excited to see where Mai Shiranui could take the game next. Thankfully, Mai Shiranui's gameplay trailer has answered a lot of these questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, Mai can't quite dive into the background like Terry does. However, Mai still references the lane change mechanic, as one of her kicks sends enemies into the background for a brief spin. Other than that, many of her moves are true to her classic fighting style, with her fan tosses creating plenty of opportunities for combo extensions. Most impressive of all,
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  introduces Flame Stocks to her kit, which are a stackable resource that allows Mai to empower her special moves and Super Arts.
 </p>
 <h3 id="mai-shiranui-dlc-coincides-with-a-big-event-for-fighting-games">
  Mai Shiranui DLC Coincides with a Big Event for Fighting Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Considering it's so close, Mai Shiranui's release date is the first thing fans should get excited about. Mai is currently scheduled to be released on February 5 and will enter the game alongside new content for players to sink their teeth into. While her default costume is based around her most iconic look, her Outfit 2 seems to be inspired by her redesign from
  <em>
   Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves
  </em>
  will release on April 21, which is just shy of two months after Mai joins
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  . This makes for a pretty natural cross-promotion between the two, meaning fans could be in for Mai Shiranui to make a few references to the upcoming title. While a new
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  game is plenty of reason for fans to get excited, Mai Shiranui's established connection to
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  will likely have an even greater hold of her inclusion in its DLC.
 </p>
 <h3 id="fatal-fury-and-street-fighter-6-have-a-lot-of-history">
  Fatal Fury and Street Fighter 6 Have a Lot of History
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another important thing that fans should expect is for
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  to take advantage of its shared continuity with
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  . Although
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  has never hosted guest characters before Terry, plenty of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  's own characters have made the jump into various crossovers. Among these crossover series,
  <em>
   Capcom vs. SNK
  </em>
  is one of the most iconic, and undoubtedly the most important for Mai.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capcom and SNK were once rival publishers who eventually became more friendly thanks in part to
  <em>
   Capcom vs. SNK
  </em>
  . Similar to Ryu and Chun-Li being the faces of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  , Terry and Mai have long been the faces of SNK thanks to their roles in
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  . When it came time for the two iconic fighting game franchises to crossover, it was only right for their most iconic characters to face off. Mai Shiranui quickly formed a fierce rivalry with Chun-Li, and it has been referenced in other crossovers ever since.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that Mai will finally make her way into
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  for the first time, one can expect this rivalry to keep up. Of course, Mai might have plenty to say to Terry in World Tour once they cross paths, but her interactions with the World Warriors are a huge part of this DLC's appeal. Barring a miracle from Rock Howard, it's a little unlikely that another
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  character will make it into
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  in the near future. Thankfully, Mai shouldn't have any problem getting familiar with the rest of the game's cast.

      <title>Non-Marvel and DC Superhero Game Franchises Shouldn’t Face the Reaper</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/marvel-dc-superhero-franchises-games-good/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Thanks to the likes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, superheroes are practically everywhere these days. The franchise may be faltering a bit, but successes like
  <em>
   Deadpool and Wolverine
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  show that
  <strong>
   Marvel
  </strong>
  's expansive catalog of characters will not be going anywhere anytime soon. Even though DC has not had a massive hit in a while, it too is showing no signs of slowing down as the DCU has kicked off. While that is great for fans of these IPs, it also seems to be coming at the expense of original superhero tales.

  For years, the video game industry had its own superhero franchises alongside Marvel and DC titles. But recently, it seems like said titles have taken a backseat to new adventures with Marvel or DC's titular characters. That means that instead of getting to explore a world like
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  , players are being put into the shoes of Spider-Man. Even though those experiences are a lot of fun, those original stories should still get their chance to shine.

  The Industry Used to Have a Couple Original Superhero Tales
 </h3>
 <p>
  There was a time when many studios were attempting to craft their own superhero franchises within the video game space. Radical Entertainment had the
  <em>
   Prototype
  </em>
  series, Sucker Punch was taking players on wild adventures through
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  , and Xbox Game Studios gave players immense power through its
  <em>
   Crackdown
  </em>
  franchise. Alongside those came all sorts of online experiences, including
  <em>
   City of Heroes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Champions Online
  </em>
  and other franchises such as
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  even tapped into the market with
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed like wherever players looked, there was a superhero game waiting for them. While not every game was fantastic, there was a lot of fun to be had here. Many players still consider the
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  series to be the best superhero titles on the market, there really has not been a game like
  <em>
   Prototype
  </em>
  , and that first
  <em>
   Crackdown
  </em>
  will forever be fondly remembered. However, even with that success, the days of said franchises seem to be over.
 </p>
 <h3 id="those-tales-seem-to-be-getting-phased-out-for-marvel-and-dc-characters">
  Those Tales Seem to be Getting Phased Out for Marvel and DC Characters
 </h3>
 <p>
  Most of these series have not had a new entry in a little while now, with most feeling like they will never see the light of day again. The
  <em>
   Prototype
  </em>
  series has not been heard from since 2012, Sucker Punch has not touched
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  since
  <em>
   Infamous First Light
  </em>
  in 2014, and
  <em>
   Crackdown 3
  </em>
  seemingly killed that franchise back in 2019. Additionally,
  <em>
   City of Heroes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Champions Online
  </em>
  have shut their doors while the
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  franchise tried completely reinventing itself in 2022, which resulted in the studio closing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of getting those original tales, players are being treated to Marvel and DC titles. Sony has set aside
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  in favor of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  , Arkane is hard at work on
  <em>
   Marvel's Blade
  </em>
  , and online titles such as
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  have seemingly cornered the shooter market. DC also has a plethora of adventures in the works, with the likes of Monolith's
  <em>
   Wonder Woman
  </em>
  looming on the horizon. While that all sounds like a lot of fun, it should not come at the expense of the other franchises.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those original superhero franchises could still shine alongside the bigger Marvel and DC brands. Of course, they will likely not get as much attention since they are not from the big comic book companies. Those franchises could still give players something special; not only were they able to deliver fantastic superhero experiences, but they also did things that these other titles have not done.

  Making outfits in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley

  is many players' favorite activity in the game.

Players can tailor most of these items themselves using items they find around the world.

   The magic of Stardew Valley lies in its ability to let players fully immerse themselves in their farming adventure. From their clothing to the names of their pets, players can customize everything and truly make the farm their own. For farmers who want to add some personality to their wardrobe, Emily’s sewing machine opens up a whole world of creativity. With just a piece of Cloth and almost any item you can think of, players can design a bunch of clothing items to suit their moods. The combination of these materials determines the final appearance and players have the freedom to create anything they desire. This guide has now been updated with some more of the coolest clothing items players can craft in Stardew Valley after the recent 1.6 update.
  </em>
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-craft-clothes">
  How To Craft Clothes
 </h3>
 <p>
  To craft clothing, players will need various items. First, players should prioritize buying an animal that gives wool, either rabbits or sheep. Then, they should work on gaining access to a Loom, which is available at level 7 of Farming. After this, players can craft cloth by placing wool in the loom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players acquire cloth, players will get a cutscene with Emily that talks about her sewing machine in her home. After this time, players can start using her machine to tailor or dye items. If players complete the "Rock Rejuvenation" Story Board quest, which has players giving Emily 1 Ruby, 1 Topaz, 1 Emerald, 1 Jade, and 1 Amethyst, players will get rewarded with their own sewing machine to craft various clothing items.

A Warp Totem: Island can be bought from the Volcano Dwarf Trader on floor 5 of the Volcano Dungeon on Ginger Island.

  The Goodnight Shirt is one of Stardew's coziest options. There aren't many clothes available that are best for bedtime, but for anybody who wants to share their enthusiasm for the nighttime, this is the t-shirt to do it. It's also a great option for those who prefer a darker, more emo style — particularly those who might be interested in romancing a certain black-haired bachelor.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make this night sky shirt, players will need to obtain the rather rare mineral
  <strong>
   Lunarite
  </strong>
  . It might be challenging for players to get their hands on it, since it's only dropped in Frozen and Omni Geodes. Luckily, apart from donating it to the museum, this is the only thing Lunarite is useful for, so players only have to come across it once to make this shirt.

  For any fans of fishing, or shrimp in general, there's a
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  shirt ready to demonstrate the player's passion for crustaceans: the Shrimp Enthusiast Shirt. This lovely pale pink shirt has a shrimp design in the center that would look cute on any farmer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making the Shrimp Enthusiast Shirt is easy for any fishing fans since it requires some Cloth and a Shrimp Cocktail. A Shrimp Cocktail needs three ingredients: Tomato, Shrimp, and Wild Horseradish. Wild Horseradish can be foraged and grown in Spring, Tomatoes can be grown in Summer, and Shrimp can be caught in a crab pot. Cooking all this together will make a Shrimp Cocktail, and combined with Cloth in the sewing machine will make a Shrimp Enthusiast Shirt.

  is a rare item obtained by completing the maze during the Spirit's Eve festival on the 27th of Fall. Once players combine the Golden Pumpkin with Cloth at a sewing machine, either Emily's or the one you get from the "Rock Rejuvenation" special order. The Witch Hat cannot be sold, so once crafted, the player can keep and wear it whenever they want.

  Any gamers who want to show up to their wedding, or a festival, looking smart and respectable, Tuxedos are absolutely the right choice. Not only are they the perfect option to elevate any occasion, but they're available in two different colors. To create a Red Tuxedo, players will need Cloth and a Red Plate, and for the Navy Tuxedo, they'll need Cloth and a Rare Disc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the name, Rare Discs are not too difficult to come across. They can be dropped by Bats, Shadow Brutes, Spiders, and Shadow Shaman — and can be found in Fishing Treasure Chests. Making a Red Plate is even easier, and only takes one Red Cabbage and One Radish. Red Cabbage and Radishes can be grown in Summer.

  This brown pirate's hat is a must for those venturing out into
  <em>
   Stardew's
  </em>
  seas. Sailing never looked so good, and sporting this leather hat with a red feather is a great way for players to show their swashbuckling spirit. There's no doubt this accessory has Willy's seal of approval.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure only the bravest of adventurers don this hat, it requires a rare ingredient: a Dragon Tooth. This item can be acquired in the Volcano Dungeon on Ginger Island, within the bones of a long-dead dragon. Alternatively, Lava Lurk's have a 15% chance of dropping them, making this one of the tougher items of clothing to make.

  For those who want some arcane attire, this gold-trimmed shirt is a great option. Typically sported by Pelican Town's local magical practitioner, M. Rasmodius, players who are taking up the magical mantle will be thrilled to strut around town in this cool tee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players probably won't be surprised to learn that this powerful piece of clothing requires a void essence. This can be looted from monsters in the mine, generally dropped by higher-level enemies. Alternatively, for those who have met the charming sewer dweller, Krobus sells void essence for 100g. Void Essence is also loved by The Wizard, so collecting a few will make it easy to befriend him and learn all his sorcery secrets.

  For any players who love their Slime farming abilities, the Slime Shirt is the absolute best way to demonstrate their love. This green shirt has the cutest little Slime face on it and will be sure to signal to everyone in Pelican Town that monsters aren't always what they seem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making this adorable t-shirt won't be difficult for adventurers and Slime farmers since it only requires some Cloth and Petrified Slime. Petrified Slime can be found in some Geodes that Clint will open for a small fee, and it can sometimes be found in Slime Balls that players will get from the Slime Hutch on their farm.

  Players who visit Ginger Island might feel a bit out of character when they see their friends sporting their cute bathing suits while they're still in their farming clothes. But thankfully, there is a way around this. Players can craft themselves their own bikini top to wear when relaxing in the sun on Ginger Island.
 </p>
 <p>
  To craft this bikini top, players must use up one of their Golden Coconuts in the sewing machine with a piece of cloth. But thankfully, there are ways around using up any forage ones. If players purchase 10 regular coconuts from the Oasis on Monday, they can use these to trade with the Island Trader for 1 Golden one.

  Not all shirts have to be simple button-downs or plain tees. Some shirts can be pretty cool and fit a certain aesthetic that players are trying to achieve. And what better aesthetic should farmers have than a cowboy one? To get themselves in the mindset of being a rancher in their field, players should craft themselves the cute Cowboy Poncho.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will have to find the Rusty Spur artifact by digging up artifact spots on the farm, or by tilling the mines or skull caverns. This item can also be found when fishing up treasure chests, or artifact troves. Combine this with a piece of cloth, players will receive their country Cowboy Poncho.

 <p>
  There is always an abundance of red mushrooms when exploring
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , as it's one of the most common forgeable items. Especially if players end up doing a mushroom cave instead of a fruit cave. There are many uses for the mushroom, and one of them is making an incredibly cute hat for players to wear for a trendy look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Mushrooms can be found in the mines, the Secret Woods in the summer, the Farm Cave if players choose this option of fruit, in the Fall if players have the Forest Farm map, or from a Tapped Mushroom tree. They can also be found in trash cans, the traveling cart, and the mushroom cave on Ginger Island. Combine a red mushroom with a piece of cloth in the sewing machine to get this Red Headscarf.

 <p>
  Qi is one of the most mysterious and powerful characters in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , so many players might want to do everything they can to become like him. Thankfully, there is a wacky and interesting way to carry a bit of Qi along with players by crafting a Qi Mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players must grow a Qi Fruit that is from Qi Beans. They are produced after 4 days. Note that this item is part of one of his quests, the Qi Crop quest. All the fruit and beans will despawn after this quest is over, so players must craft this item before the quest is complete. Combine this fruit with a piece of cloth in the sewing machine to craft the mask.

 </ul>
 <p>
  At some point, players will end up finding the same artifacts over and over with no use for them. After players donate one of each item, these artifacts are either kept for random quests or sold off for a few extra coins. Thankfully they can also be used to tailor cute clothing items, like the Hair Bone. If players have an extra Prehistoric Tibia lying around, combine this with a piece of cloth and get a cute hairstyle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prehistoric Tibia bones are found when digging through artifact spots near the Railroad or in Cindersnap Forest. There is also a 30% chance that a Pepper Rex will drop one when defeated. If players have access to Ginger Island, they can also be found when breaking Bone Nodes at the dig site. If players combine the bone with a piece of cloth in the sewing machine, they will get this item.

 </ul>
 <p>
  The Golden Mask is strange and somewhat ominous-looking, but its rarity makes it a prized possession for those who are looking to accentuate their style with something truly unique. Thanks to its shining gold color, the Golden Mask can be used with an array of dark clothes, which will help it stand out among the players' face. It's fun to look at and almost makes the player look like a robot (or a James Bond villain). Unfortunately, it can be a bit of a nuisance to get ahold of, as players will need a "real Golden Mask" to use on the Sewing Machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get the Golden Mask, players need to first find an actual Golden Mask relic. This can be done by digging through Artifact spots sprinkled around the Desert. It can also sometimes appear within an Artifact Trove. That said, it has a measly 3 percent drop rate.

  Those looking to dabble in a little Prehistoric fashion should get their hands on the Dinosaur Hat. This adorable little topper will accentuate the Dinosaur Pants, but it's super cute simply on its own. The Dinosaur Hat can go well with any clothing as it simply stands out, without the need for color-matching. Those who want to be a bit silly while also showing their appreciation for the reptiles of yesteryear can head to a Sewing Machine and toss in the required materials to pop out this precious headwear.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dinosaur Hat can be made by feeding a Dinosaur Egg into the spool of the Sewing Machine. Players can obtain a Dinosaur Egg from a variety of sources, including Artifact spots hidden within the mountains, any Prehistoric floors within the Skull Cavern, fishing treasure chests, and even from the Claw Machine game at the Movie Theater.

 <p>
  Most players use Squid Ink as a dye thanks to its beautiful appearance, but it can also be added to the spool of the Sewing Machine to craft a unique and stylish jacket. Those who want something a bit ornate, with gold buttons that stand out proudly against a dark blue color, should save some Squid Ink for their tailoring escapades. The Midnight Dog Jacket is one of the coolest pieces of clothing that a player can craft, and it looks fantastic with a variety of hats and pants, making it a focal centerpiece of many different designs and styles.
 </p>
 <p>
  To craft the Midnight Dog Jacket, players need to first go ahead and grab some Squid Ink. This can be found from a variety of sources, such as drops from Squid Kids or Blue Squids in combat. It can also be gained from Squids and Midnight Squids pulled from fishing ponds.

  For those who prefer a goofy look for their character, the Trash Can Shirt is perfect; it makes the player's character look almost exactly like a trash can in town. When paired with the Trash Can Hat, players can look like trash (if they really want to, that is!).
 </p>
 <p>
  Because
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  features numerous items that take a wacky approach to fashion design, many players choose to create outfits that incorporate strange items like the Trash Can Shirt, sometimes even using mods to change their hair or other features. Players who want to tailor a Trash Can Shirt of their own should head to the sewing machine inside Emily and Haley's house. They will then need to combine Cloth with one of the following: Broken CD, Broken Glasses, Driftwood, Soggy Newspaper, and Trash.

  The Garbage Hat is the perfect item to accompany the Trash Can Shirt to create a complete outfit. Alternatively, players can wear it on their own to add a lighthearted touch to a more serious outfit of any kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being one of the strangest hats in the game, the Garbage Hat's silly design combined with its rarity makes it a fun and exciting find for any players who may randomly come across it in a garbage can in town. The Garbage Hat can be found in garbage cans at a 0.2% find rate. Players must open at least 20 garbage cans before they can find the Garbage Hat.

   <em>
    Path of Exile 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  launched in early access just a little over one month ago, and it was arguably already in a great spot. Then, this week, GGG released
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  's first big 2025 patch, which addressed a plethora of issues and bugs, and it implemented or acted on player feedback in some key areas. For example, players can now overwrite Runes and other socketables like Cores in their items with a different socketable, which was a big issue with the Rune system so far. While the game is doing great and can only grow from here, it can capitalize on three changes to its current version of the endgame.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it stands, there is a lot for players to do after they finish the campaign and the Cruel difficulty Acts.
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  takes players to the Ziggurat Refuge, which acts like a base of operations for players to slowly make their way through higher tiers of Waystones, starting from Tier 1. The Atlas has a multitude of map nodes for players to choose from, with several icons that represent different League mechanics or other modifiers, such as bosses. All this can be quite exciting at first, but there are changes GGG can implement to improve the overall experience: a Waystone stash tab, better map/biome visibility on the Atlas, and a less frustrating approach to death.

  's endgame requires players to constantly move through Waystones, as they are needed to advance through the Atlas and its fog of war and to complete objectives, like getting Atlas passives or reaching key parts of it, like the Burning Monolith and the three Citadels. As such, a great addition to the game would be a dedicated Waystone stash tab where players can easily store and access all their Waystones, filter by keywords, and group them by Tier.

     Stash tabs are usually paid content in Path of Exile 2 (and its predecessor), but a Waystone stash tab would be such a massive quality-of-life addition that it would arguably be fine even if it weren't free.

  How Path of Exile 2 Could Improve its Mapping Experience
 </h3>
 <p>
  While the recent 0.1.1
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  patch did add new functionality to the Atlas where each map node states its biome, this could be taken to the next level. For example, each map node could have a brief video attached to it showcasing both a sample layout of the area and its mini-map. This would be a game-changer because some League mechanics, like
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  's Breach or Ritual, are area-based. If a Breach or Ritual spawns in a narrow corridor, with some map types having multiple of these, they can be dramatically less rewarding than they would otherwise.
 </p>
 <h3 id="why-path-of-exile-2-should-reconsider-its-one-portal-policy">
  Why Path of Exile 2 Should Reconsider its One-Portal Policy
 </h3>
 <p>
  Last but not least,
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  's approach to death might need some changes. It's no secret that GGG wanted the game to be slower and more methodical in its combat, especially with boss fights being a prevalent part of the ARPG. However, the game can be very punishing in the endgame section, where dying in any Waystone means losing experience and access to the Waystone itself, including all loot that hadn't been picked up before the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reasoning from GGG seems to be that, this way, players can learn from the experience and improve their characters and builds accordingly. However, this is hardly the case for many reasons, like how it can be very hard to change gear pieces on the fly or how the game doesn't really have a death recap screen where it clearly states what happened. On top of that, although
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  can be paused, which it is also supposed to do automatically in case one is disconnected, it does happen that players may be disconnected and still die to it. What follows is that making death less punishing, alongside the other changes, would make
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  the best version of itself.

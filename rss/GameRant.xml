  Matching up against the true master of Puck, the Faerie Dragon, is one of the scariest experiences in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dota 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . With multiple escape tools at its disposal, along with massive burst damage from its abilities, a skilled Puck player can dominate the game from the laning phase to the moment the opponent's Ancient is destroyed.

  However, Puck is also one of the most challenging heroes in
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  to learn, let alone master. While the hero's item build is relatively straightforward, truly mastering Puck requires time, patience, and a lot of practice. In this build guide, we'll outline the optimal ability order and item progression to help you learn the hero the right way.

 <p>
  Puck is a ranged Intelligence hero with a complexity rating of two stars in
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  . The hero starts with decent primary stats, but its exceptionally low base Strength and Strength gain make it an easy target to kill. However, the mobility spells at its disposal offset this weakness, allowing Puck to evade threats and stay alive in fights.

  Additionally, Patch 7.36, aka the Crownfall update, introduced an Innate Ability and two Facets for the hero to choose from at the start of the game:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Innate Ability (Puckish):
   </strong>
   Puck restores a bit of health and mana anytime it disjoints an attack or spell projectile.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Facet 1 (Jostling Rift):
   </strong>
   Waning Rift can be set to Alt-Cast, pulling enemies towards the center of its AoE.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Facet 2 (Curveball)
   </strong>
   : Illusory Orb becomes a vector-targeted spell that can be curved in any direction. Its travel speed and duration are also increased.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">

  Puck also gains upgrades for its abilities after purchasing the Aghanim's Shard and Aghanim's Scepter:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Aghanim's Shard:
   </strong>
   Upgrades Phase Shift, allowing Puck to attack all enemies within its attack range each time the ability is used. It also grants bonus magic damage to Puck's auto-attacks.

  <li>
   <strong>

  There are two ways to play Puck in
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  : as a physical damage-dealer, or a caster that relies on his spells. While both builds are good, in the high MMR bracket, most players tend to favor the caster build. This build focuses on building items that allow Puck to survive in fights and use his abilities to deal massive damage to the enemy heroes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   For this guide, we will focus on the caster build,
  </strong>
  as it utilizes Puck's abilities to its fullest extent. Puck's biggest strength is his elusiveness. With this build, you'll be playing from a distance and using your spells to contribute to the teamfight. You can also commit to killing the opponent backline if you find the right opportunity.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Most Puck players opt to go with the
  <strong>
   Jostling Rift Facet
  </strong>
  when playing Puck. It adds an extra bit of catch to the hero's toolkit. Since
  <strong>
   Waning Rift
  </strong>
  has a low cooldown on its own, you can use it multiple times during a chase to keep the enemy from running away. Besides, you can still turn off Auto-Cast to push enemies and break coils.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for his abilities, Puck usually focuses on maxing out its two nukes early on during the laning phase. The first ability you'll take for the lane is
  <strong>
   Illusory Orb.
  </strong>
  It lets you harass your lane opponent from a safe distance and shove out the creep wave under the tower. You can put a value point in Phase Shift if you're up against a nuker like Lina to dodge some of her spells. Alternate between Phase Shift and Waning Rift and put a point in your ultimate when you hit level 6.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Puck's Talents, we recommend the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10:
   </strong>
   +40 Illusory Orb Damage
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 15:
   </strong>
   +60 Waning Rift Damage
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 20:
   </strong>
   -3s Waning Rift Cooldown
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 25:
   </strong>
   Dream Coil Pierces Debuff Immunity.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Puck is one of those heroes who doesn't like to build damage items, especially when playing as a spellcaster. You'll want to work towards mobility items so that you can survive the teamfights while consistently spamming your abilities to create chaos in the enemy ranks. Here are the items that work well on the hero.
 </p>
 <h3 id="starting-items">
  Starting Items
 </h3>
 <p>
  Since you're playing as the solo mid, you don't need to focus as much on regen as a safe lane carry. A set of
  <strong>
   Tango, one Faerie Fire, and four Iron Branches
  </strong>
  should be all you need to secure the last hits on the lane without dying until you get your Bottle. You'll also want an
  <strong>
   Observer Ward
  </strong>
  on the rune spot to scout gank attempts from the enemy team.
 </p>
 <h3 id="early-game">
  Early Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  As a midlaner, your first two waves of creeps are extremely important. Use your spells to harass the lane opponent while securing the last hit to buy your
  <strong>
   Bottle
  </strong>
  . Once you have your Bottle, make sure you pick up the
  <strong>
   Water
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Bounty Runes
  </strong>
  to ensure a steady source of regen in the laning stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  After your Bottle, buy a
  <strong>
   Null Talisman
  </strong>
  for some stats, a
  <strong>
   Magic Wand
  </strong>
  for an extra bit of sustain, and
  <strong>
   Boots of Speed.
  </strong>
  Upgrade the Boots of Speed to Power Tread as soon as you manage to save up enough Gold for it.
 </p>
 <h3 id="core-items">
  Core Items
 </h3>
 <p>
  The biggest power spike for Puck in the early game is when you manage to buy the
  <strong>
   Witch Blade
  </strong>
  . This item increases your projectile speed and also gives you an extra DOT (Damage Over Time) attack to help kill enemy heroes on the map. If your other lanes are doing well, focus on farming until you get your hands on the item.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that's done, you can start playing a bit more actively. Rotate to your side lanes and help your Offlaner secure kills on the enemy core. The next item to go for is the
  <strong>
   Blink Dagger
  </strong>
  . This will serve as your primary initiation tool.
  <strong>
   Aghanim's Shard
  </strong>
  comes next, adding more damage to your arsenal.
 </p>
 <h3 id="situational-items">
  Situational Items
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  is an extremely dynamic MOBA where every matchup can affect your item choice and decision. After picking up your core items, you'll want to take a moment to consider what you'll need to be more effective during fights. If the enemy team has too many disables for you to play around, go with
  <strong>
   Black King Bar
  </strong>
  . Against one or two silences, however,
  <strong>
   Eul's Scepter of Divinity
  </strong>
  should suffice. You can even upgrade it to Wind Waker in the late game. When you're playing against a strong initiator like Storm Spirit, it's better to go with a
  <strong>
   Linken's Sphere
  </strong>
  to disjoint the first instance of disable.

  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_38">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     In certain matchups, you can even consider going with Aeon Disk if you're having trouble staying alive.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  If you'd rather buy aggressive items, you've got a few good options.
  <strong>
   Upgrading your Witch Blade to Parasma
  </strong>
  is an excellent way to maximize your inventory space while adding more damage potential.
  <strong>
   Aghanim's Scepter
  </strong>
  is also a fantastic pickup for Puck to upgrade the Dream Coil.

  The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport is a luxurious hypercar with a convertible design. Powered by a whopping quad-turbocharged W16 engine, this beast of a machine offers incredible acceleration and is capable of reaching a top speed of whopping 407 km/h.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Bugatti excels on the straight highways, but its weight makes it a challenge to maneuver sharp turns at high speeds. Drivers that enjoy blazing past the competition on straight roads, or simply want to experience the thrill of top-speed driving, should be satisfied with the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Snap
   </strong>
  </em>
  is offering compensation rewards to account for its period of unavailability across the United States due to a brief shutdown period earlier this month. While the rewards package offered by
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  will be available to players across the world, players in the United States will have access to extra rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nuverse, the publisher for Marvel's PC and mobile-based card battler, is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese-owned company that also owns the video-based social media platform TikTok and has become a focal point in U.S. politics over the past several months. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. Congress approved the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which listed ByteDance by name as one of said adversaries. On January 19, the ban on
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  caused the game to become unavailable to all players in the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the action against ByteDance has been temporarily stayed, and as of last week,
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  has returned to the U.S. market. In a recent Twitter article, developer Second Dinner expressed a need to make amends for the timed rewards, contents, and missions that have been disrupted by the outage. This culminates in all U.S.-based players who had logged in within 30 days of the outage's start date receiving one of two different US Downtime Packages, depending on whether their Collection Level exceeds 500. Rewards for those over 500 include two Spotlight Keys, 4,150 Credits, 6,200 Collector’s Tokens, five Gold Conquest Tickets, three Infinite Conquest Tickets, 4,000 Conquest Medals, and three Cosmic Gold Borders. Under-500 players receive six Mystery Series 3 Cards, 7150 Credits, and three Cosmic Gold Borders. Both versions of this package also contain 1,000 Gold, a Mystery Variant, six Premium Mystery Variants, a Cosmic Red Border, and 155 x5 Random Boosters.

 <p>
  Starbreeze Studios has announced a surprising collaboration between the 2012 indie game
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Payday 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  . While the two series have collaborated in the past,
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  hasn't been particularly relevant for a long time, making its inclusion in
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  a pleasant surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  has faced an uphill battle ever since its launch. It received an extremely polarizing response upon launch, and didn't feature nearly as much content as its predecessor. Many were left wondering why they'd bother to leave
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  behind at all. For a short time in 2024,
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  clawed its way to "Mostly Positive" Steam reviews, although this has since fallen back to "Mixed." That hasn't stopped Starbreeze Studios from continuing to work on
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  , despite the game failing to meet critical or commercial expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new trailer released online confirmed that
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  is getting a
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  collaboration, bringing one of the best indie games of all time to the heist shooter. The pack itself will allow gamers to play as the voiceless protagonist Jacket, and adds several new weapons to the game. One of the new Overkill Weapons is called Sociopath, and looks just like the baseball bat Jacket uses in
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  . The Jacket Character Pack is set to release for
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  on February 3, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions of the game.

 <p>
  Curiously, this isn't the first collaboration between the two. A
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  DLC was also released for
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  back in 2014, although notably, this was when the hype for the original game was still high, and the sequel was still in the works. There hasn't been a
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  game in almost a decade, and as great as it is, it's undoubtedly less relevant than it was at the time. Therefore, it's pretty surprising to see this collaboration come to life. It's still a welcome surprise - more
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  is never a bad thing.

 <p>
  It remains to be seen what the future holds for
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  . The franchise still has plenty of name value among gamers, but it has undeniably been hurt by the reaction to
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  . It was announced at the tail end of 2024 that
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  will be getting a lower level of investment moving forward, a worrying sign for fans. While Starbreeze Studios remains confident it can deliver good value to players, it has a very long road ahead if the game is to live up to the legacy of its predecessor.

  Just like in most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, redeeming
  <em>
   UGC Limited
  </em>
  codes is not difficult, and it is just one of the few actions you can do here. However, if you encounter any difficulties or something doesn't work properly, follow these instructions to figure out what to do:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    UGC Limited
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the top of the screen. There will be a button that says UGC CODES. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open a new menu. There will be two big buttons. Among them, interact with the second one, which says Redeem Codes.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the redemption menu. There will be an input field and a white Redeem button below it. Now, enter manually or, better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lastly, click on the white Redeem button to submit your reward request.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, you will see a notification “Code successfully redeemed” and the limited UGC will appear on your screen.

  To find more
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  codes, you'll need to follow creators who use
  <em>
   UGC Limited
  </em>
  as a tool to promote their UGC. Considering that the audience engagement in this experience is quite high, you can easily find a content maker whose stuff you like and get a code, or become a UGC creator yourself and share it with others.

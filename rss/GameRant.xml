  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  offers a variety of Contracts, each requiring
  <strong>
   players to complete specific in-game tasks in exchange for valuable rewards
  </strong>
  such as cash, gas masks, armor, and other essential items and intel to aid survival in Verdansk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game features
  <strong>
   five base Contracts
  </strong>
  , including the familiar
  <strong>
   Bounty
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Most Wanted
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Scavenger
  </strong>
  , along with the return of two originals from the first iteration:
  <strong>
   Recon
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Supply Run
  </strong>
  . Each Contract aligns with its name, offering players rewards for completing the assigned task within a set time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contracts are an
  <strong>
   excellent way to kick off a match
  </strong>
  , allowing players to
  <strong>
   earn enough money to purchase a Loadout Drop
  </strong>
  and access their custom loadouts as quickly as possible. Alternatively, they can be used to
  <strong>
   stock up on armor, UAVs, and other equipment
  </strong>
  to maximize survival chances throughout the game.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Recon
  </strong>
  Contract replaces the previously available Intel Contract and is identified by a flag icon. Players have
  <strong>
   four minutes to reach the comms station
  </strong>
  objective,
  <strong>
   stand within a small radius
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   upload data
  </strong>
  . The more teammates present, the faster the upload process. However, while capturing the objective, a flare is shot into the sky, revealing your location to enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Completing the Recon Contract rewards players with cash, loot, and a
  <strong>
   preview of the next safe zone
  </strong>
  , marked by a yellow circle on the Tac Map. Additionally, completing
  <strong>
   multiple Recon Contracts in succession reveals several future safe zones
  </strong>
  , giving your squad a strategic advantage.

     With the arrival of the train system in Verdansk in
     <em>
      Warzone
     </em>
     Season 3 Reloaded (mid-season update), the Recon Contract will also be available on the train’s cargo carriages. However, activating this contract is riskier than a standard Recon, as data uploads occur while the train is in motion.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Supply Run
  </strong>
  Contract is marked by a timer icon and
  <strong>
   designates a nearby Buy Station that you must reach within two minutes
  </strong>
  . Completing this contract rewards you with
  <strong>
   cash
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   triggers a Fire Sale
  </strong>
  . Additionally, you'll be able to pick up a Self-Revive Kit or redeploy a fallen teammate for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, keep in mind that each player in the squad can only select one discounted item from the Buy Station Fire Sale event. Choose wisely, as once an item is selected, all prices return to normal. As a unique adjustment for Verdansk, the Supply Run Contract will undergo a minor adjustment starting from the second gas circle, making it more focused on travel and vehicle use.

  The
  <strong>
   Scavenger
  </strong>
  Contract is marked by a magnifying glass icon and tasks players with
  <strong>
   opening three special Supply Crates within five minutes
  </strong>
  . These crates are highlighted on your Tac Map and appear as yellow-glowing crates in-match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each crate is revealed only after opening the previous one, and while they remain within close range, players will need to move around the map to collect all three. These crates contain rare loot, and completing the contract guarantees an armor satchel from the final crate, along with a significant amount of cash.

  Contract is marked by a hitmarker icon and

  </strong>
  . Their approximate location is displayed on the Tac Map inside a yellow circle with the same contract icon, and to complete the contract, you must eliminate the target before another team does.
 </p>
 <p>
  Successful completion rewards you with a substantial amount of cash and a UAV ping centered on the fallen target’s location. Keep in mind that your target will be aware of your pursuit, as the remaining time to complete the task – along with the enemy’s name – will be displayed below the mini-map.

 <p>
  The Most Wanted Contract, marked by a crown icon, is one of the most challenging contracts in the game. It functions similarly to a Bounty, but instead of hunting a target, the
  <strong>
   player who picks it up becomes the target for all enemies in the lobby
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once activated, a
  <strong>
   large crown icon appears over you
  </strong>
  (and your squad in team modes),
  <strong>
   signaling your position to opponents
  </strong>
  . You then have
  <strong>
   five minutes to survive enemy attacks
  </strong>
  at all costs. During this time, eliminating enemies or opening supply crates reduces the countdown, helping you complete the contract faster. Successfully completing it
  <strong>
   revives all eliminated squadmates
  </strong>
  and rewards you with a
  <strong>
   considerable sum of cash
  </strong>
  .

  The
  <strong>
   Big Game Bounty
  </strong>
  Contract will be available in Verdansk starting with the
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Season 3 Reloaded update. It functions similarly to the standard Bounty contract but with a key difference – it targets the player with the most eliminations in the match. If completed within the time limit, players will be rewarded with an
  <strong>
   instant 20-second Advanced UAV
  </strong>
  and a
  <strong>
   cash bonus
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="warzone-contract-multiplier-system-explained">
  Warzone Contract Multiplier System, Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  Verdansk's return to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  is also reintroducing the original
  <strong>
   Contract Multiplier
  </strong>
  system, which rewards players with increasing bonuses for each successfully completed contract after the first. Completing
  <strong>
   multiple contracts grants additional bonus cash
  </strong>
  , and every contract across Verdansk receives an
  <strong>
   extra
  </strong>
  <strong>
   30% additive bonus
  </strong>
  <strong>
   to its payout
  </strong>
  . However, this bonus is
  <strong>
   capped after a player completes their fifth contract
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The multiplier system rewards players for completing consecutive Contracts, encouraging their use – especially early in the match when every bit of cash and loot is crucial for gearing up and gaining an advantage as the game progresses.

     To maximize this process, it’s

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong
   </em>
  </strong>
  has recently been confirmed for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and gained an official release window during the recent Nintendo Direct.
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  is one of the most eagerly awaited games of the year, and the fanbase was glad to see it finally getting an official release window.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally announced in 2019,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  has been in development for a while, and developer Team Cherry has mostly remained silent about the project in recent years. After recent disappointments with
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  , some fans grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of news surrounding the title, and many were expecting to get more information about the game during the recent Nintendo Direct.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  appeared during the April 2 Nintendo Direct, confirming a release window for 2025, and that the title will be available for the upcoming Switch 2, which will be out on June 5. While the game was only showcased in a very short teaser that features the protagonist Hornet exploring caves and fighting enemies, its appearance was enough to excite the fanbase. On social media, the reception of this news was very positive, as
  <em>
   Hollow Knight Silksong
  </em>
  fans celebrated that the game “was actually real.”

 <p>
  Unfortunately, it’s impossible to tell when
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  will be out, as any guess between June and December 2025 is essentially fair game. A few weeks ago,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  gained an encouraging update, as the Steam repository for the game was updated in late March, which at least indicated that Team Cherry was still working on the title. However, the current status of development remains unknown, as Team Cherry only confirmed earlier this year that the game “is progressing well.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Previous predictions from the leaker Extas1s, for example, have indicated that
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  could be released by June 2025, but this does not seem very likely. The Switch 2 will be released early in June 2025, and
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  did not have an exact release date, so it’s much more probable that the title will be available later rather than sooner during the year. Obviously, it’s possible that
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  could be delayed, and only be out in 2026, but if the developers shared this release window after so much time, it’s possible that they are confident in it. In any case, the release of
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  will likely mark an important time for gamers in 2025, as many gamers are incredibly excited about the title.

 <p>
  Nintendo fans were greeted with a wealth of new information about the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  during the April 2 Nintendo Direct livestream, and now Nintendo has revealed prices for the upcoming console's controllers and accessories. The Nintendo Switch 2 is officially launching on June 5, with several games like
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  being released right alongside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be two versions of the Nintendo Switch 2 available for pre-order. The standard edition includes the main console for $449.99, while a limited-edition bundle will throw in the recently revealed
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  for $499.99. Pre-order availability might vary depending on retailers, but the Nintendo Switch 2 won't be available to order until April 9. Furthermore, the
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  Nintendo Switch 2 bundle will reportedly only be available until Fall 2025, so gamers who want to pick up the game at the same time as the console might have to hurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The console itself is only part of the gaming experience, and Nintendo has revealed the prices for a host of Nintendo Switch 2 accessories that will be available alongside the system. As shown in a Facebook post from IGN, the standard Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Controllers will be priced at $89.99, while the recently announced Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller costs $79.99. A Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip has a price of $34.99, while a set of spare Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 straps is $12.99.

  All of these controllers and accessories will presumably be made available when the Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025. Nintendo has stated that it has plans in place to deal with scalpers who try to snatch the Switch 2 and resell it at inflated prices, and analysts expect the new console to fly out of retailer inventories when it is finally made available to pre-order.

      <title>Every New Feature Confirmed For Mario Kart World So Far</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  was not only the highest-selling game on the Wii U, but is also currently the best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch, beating out the second-place spot (
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  ) by an eye-watering 20 million copies. It's only natural that Nintendo would want to capture that success from the outset with the Nintendo Switch 2. The very first teaser for the Switch 2 featured around 20 seconds of footage of what seemed to be a new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart

  </em>
  entry, one that looked much bigger than anything the series had done before.

 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  's trailer taglines, players will be able to "drive virtually everywhere" in the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. This means that players will now be able to jump, grind on rails, and seemingly drive on walls for a brief duration. While grinding on rails, players will also be able to perform tricks, presumably to receive continuous speed boosts.

 <h3 id="a-world-spanning-track-list">
  A World-Spanning Track List
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  is really making the most of its namesake feature. The meat of the game will be its 7 Grand Prix cups, each consisting of four individual tracks. Each of
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  's tracks is set in a different location, some of which take place in the same real-world-inspired region. When playing
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  's Grand Prix mode, each track in a cup is connected and flows seamlessly into one another, meaning players race through four tracks consecutively with no loading screens in between.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  's Knockout Tour mode, players will drive from one end of the world to the other. This mode will see players racing across 6 consecutive tracks, and at the end of each one, they'll pass through a numbered gate. If the player's position is lower than the gate number, they'll be eliminated from the race entirely.

 <h3 id="free-roam">

 <p>
  Another huge new feature is
  <em>

  </em>
  's Free Roam mode, where players have free rein over the entire world and all of the game's tracks. Either alone or in co-op, players can drive freely around various environments, discovering shortcuts that they can use during races, and finding fun secrets hidden throughout the world. This Free Roam mode also seems to come with a Photo Mode feature,

It's also unclear if this customization is solely item-based or if players will be able to swap outfits before a race.

 <p>
  By the time the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  Direct came to a close, Nintendo confirmed a whopping 20 launch games for its next-generation console. The Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449.99, with a
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  bundle available for $499.99.
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  is easily the headlining launch game for the Switch 2, but Nintendo highlighted some other games that are in development for the console as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  A little over a month after the Switch 2 launches,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Bananza
  </em>
  will release, while
  <em>
   Kirby Air Riders
  </em>
  is on deck for later in 2025.
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment
  </em>
  is coming this winter, and the brand-new FromSoftware game,
  <em>
   The Duskbloods
  </em>
  , is scheduled to launch as a Switch 2 exclusive in 2026. But while there are plenty of upcoming Switch 2 games to be excited about later in the year and beyond, most are likely focused on what the console has in store in terms of its launch lineup.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's entirely possible that Nintendo will add to the Switch 2 launch games list, but 20 games were confirmed during the company's latest Direct presentation. As announced by Nintendo, the Switch 2 launch games are

  The Switch 2 exclusives will likely get the most attention when it comes to the launch lineup.
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  is the main Switch 2 exclusive for launch, with the new game offering open world racing, new power-ups, a battle royale-style mode, and more, but there's also the tech demo-like
  <em>
   Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour
  </em>
  to take into account as well. Switch 2 early adopters may also be interested in purchasing the upgrades for
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , as both games will have special Nintendo Switch 2 Editions available at launch that give them significant performance boosts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, the Switch 2 launch lineup largely consists of ports of games that are readily available on existing platforms, but that's not a bad thing.
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  had a rough start, but is now considered one of the better RPGs on the market, and
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  has earned widespread critical acclaim since its release earlier this year. All things considered, the Switch 2 launch lineup isn't too shabby, and there will be many more exciting games released for the console in the years to come.

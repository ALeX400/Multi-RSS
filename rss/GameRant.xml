 <p>
	Xbox is currently hosting a sale that heavily discounts
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Call of Duty
	 </strong>
	</em>
	games, but since all these titles are likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the near future, it may be best not to buy them. Xbox's acquisition of Activision Blizzard means that the company now owns all the games published by the company. In turn, this means Xbox is free to bring said titles, like
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/call-of-duty/">
	 <em>
		Call of Duty
	 </em>
	</a>
	, to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service.

 <p>
	Xbox Game Pass has been key to Xbox's strategy in recent years, with the company doing whatever it possibly can to bring in new subscribers.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-may-2024-perks-apex-legends-sea-of-thieves/">
	 Xbox Game Pass subscribers enjoy exclusive benefits and discounts
	</a>
	, plus they get access to a huge library of games that is updated regularly. Brand-new, day one releases come to Xbox Game Pass all the time, but the service is also home to plenty of older games. And soon, it will most likely be a one-stop destination for the vast majority of games in the
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	series.

	 <em>
		Call of Duty
	 </em>
	 coming to Xbox Game Pass
	</a>
	is only a matter of time, which is why Xbox gamers may want to hold off on buying the
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	games that are part of the console's latest sales promotion. Currently, the vast majority of
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	games can be purchased on Xbox for less than $20, with the most recent entry in the series, the 2023 version of
	<em>
	 Modern Warfare 3
	</em>
	, discounted to $45.49. In total, gamers would have to spend around $350 to buy all the discounted
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	games, or they could just sign up for Game Pass for a fraction of that price and soon have access to all the
	<em>
	 CoD
	</em>
	s and the many other games that are part of the service.

	</a>
	just before the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. Rumors have suggested that Xbox will announce its plans to bring classic
	<em>

	games to Game Pass as part of the June 9 showcase, where fans can also expect to get their first proper look at the franchise's 2024 release,

 <p>
	The CEO of Avalanche Studios, the developer behind the most recent
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Mad Max
	 </em>
	</strong>
	<em>
	</em>
	game, has spoken out about comments made by George Miller, the creator and director of the
	<em>
	 Mad Max
	</em>
	film franchise. While on the red carpet for the premiere of
	<em>
	 Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,
	</em>
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/mad-max-game-hideo-kojima/">
	 Miller stated that he would like Hideo Kojima to be the developer of the next
	 <em>
		Mad Max
	 </em>
	</a>
	video game adaptation, if there ever is one.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Mad Max
	</em>
	the game was released in September 2015 and received mixed reviews. While it currently sits at an “Overwhelmingly Positive” user rating on Steam, it has a 69 critic average on
	<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/1518/mad-max/charts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
	 OpenCritic
	</a>
	and a similar score on Metacritic. Players praised the game’s setting and combat, but opinions on its story and cast of characters were varied. Generally, it was agreed that Avalanche succeeded in replicating the unwelcoming atmosphere of the
	<em>
	 <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/mad-max/">
		Mad Max
	 </a>
	</em>
	films, though some people felt that the open world and locations were a bit too plain and repetitive.

	George Miller apparently fell into the category of people who weren't satisfied with the
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/mad-max-game-canon-furiosa-chumbucket/">
	 2015
	 <em>
		Mad Max
	 </em>
	 video game
	</a>
	. The director stated that the adaptation “wasn’t as good as I wanted it to be,” despite the film studio giving “all of our material to a company to do it.” Christofer Sundberg, CEO of Avalanche Studios, understandably took umbrage with Miller’s comments. The developer stated on social media that the remark was “complete nonsense and just shows complete arrogance.”

 <p>
	According to Sundberg, the film studio wanted to make the game adaptation linear even though Avalanche was an established creator of open-world titles. The Swedish development studio had already released two well-received
	<em>
	 Just Cause
	</em>
	games and was working on a third, as well as two entries in
	<em>
	 theHunter
	</em>
	franchise and
	<em>
	 Renegade Ops,
	</em>
	a vehicular combat experience with RPG elements. Despite his consternation at Miller’s comments, Sundberg agreed that Hideo Kojima would make an “awesome
	<em>
	 Mad Max
	</em>
	game, but it would be a completely different experience.” And perhaps that’s what Miller is hoping for.

 <p>
	However, the likelihood of Kojima taking the reins of a
	<em>
	 Mad Max
	</em>
	game adaptation seems unlikely, at least in the near future. The esteemed video game director is undoubtedly
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/death-stranding-2-news-updates-2024/">
	 hard at work on
	 <em>
		Death Stranding 2
	 </em>
	</a>
	, which has just finished shooting and recording with the cast. Kojima Productions is now moving on to the game’s adjustment phase, which will focus on gameplay and graphics and is expected to take about a year to complete.

	Other game developers have defended Avalanche, including

	 Larian Studios’ Michael Douse

	<em>
	 Mad Max: Fury Road,
	</em>
	the
	<em>
	</em>
	film that came out four months before the game. And due to the aforementioned disagreement over linear versus open-world gameplay,
	<em>
	 Mad Max
	</em>
	’s direction was rebooted a year into development. Despite this, many people consider
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/mad-max-every-game-released-cancelled-explained/">
	 Avalanche’s

	 to be the best game adaptation

 <p>
	Elements are a common theme in many games. This theme is especially common in gacha games, where a certain element is associated with the characters that players can control. The elements in
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Solo Leveling:ARISE
	 </strong>
	</em>
	play an important role in the game and, without proper knowledge of these elements, it can backfire on players. With correct elements used in every stage, players can change the tide of the battle in their favor.

	 Han Song-Yi

	, at the time of writing, is the worst Water character available in the game.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-strongest-protagonists/">

 <p>
	Han Song-Yi can poison her target with a 100% uptime on her skill if used correctly, which makes her a good option in DoT teams. Apart from this, Han is not very impressive, as she does mediocre damage to enemies, which makes it hard to justify investing in order to build her. However, players who like her character design and her gameplay should still try her out, as not everything in the game has to work according to the meta.

	 Anna Ruiz
	</strong>
	is a SR Water-type hunter in
	<em>
	 Solo Leveling:ARISE
	</em>
	who belongs to the Ranger class. While Anna might not be the most impressive Water-type character in the game, her status changes when she crosses Advancement Level 3. Anna works well with other DoT characters, and can be used as a shield breaker in teams thanks to her passive skill.

	Her passive ability gives her a chance to deal 100 break damage and additional damage equal to 30% of her attack for every 3 seconds, for 30 seconds, if one of Anna’s skills hits her target.

		Lee Joohe
	 </strong>
	 is an all-out healer in the game
	</a>
	that provides rapid healing to her team members. This SR Healer uses the power of the Water element to heal allies and prevent their deaths on the battlefield. Lee Joohe is built in a way that provides great healing, which can be utilized by players until the endgame content.

 <p>
	However, Lee Joohe has her own limitations as a character. While her healing is strong, she fails when it comes to damage-dealing abilities, and her damage multipliers are worse than any SR character in the game. Lee Joohe is a free unit, so players can obtain her without the gacha, and players looking for an exclusive healer might find their answer with her on the team.

	Apart from her ability to shred shields, Nam can freeze enemies with most of her skills for 2 seconds, and her passive ability works in harmony with this. Nam's passive allows her to deal 20% more damage to the frozen targets, making her a great pick for a team, where players can deal heavy damage to enemies and bosses alike without the risk of being attacked by them.

	Her skills are absolutely broken. Most of her skills when used provide the team with a shield. The break damage she deals increases when using Lightning Kick, one of her basic attacks, making her one of the best breakers in the game.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-highest-longest-skill-cooldown/">
	 Her passive allows her to reset the cooldown on her basic skills
	</a>
	and make them more powerful, allowing her to stay on the field for a long time without swapping. Because Jiwoo scales with max HP, it is easier to build her as well and, with all her broken abilities, Seo Jiwoo is one of the best available allies and team members against any monster.

	The final events of
	<em>
	 Village
	</em>
	saw the story of
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Resident Evil
	 </em>
	</strong>
	come full circle as the beginnings of Umbrella were revealed. After
	<em>
	 Resident Evil 7
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Village
	</em>
	took new protagonist Ethan Winters on a harrowing journey to find his missing wife Mia and their child Rose, the next
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/resident-evil/">
	 <em>
		Resident Evil
	 </em>
	</a>
	game would make a mistake by dropping these characters completely.
 </p>

 <p>
	Although Ethan ultimately sacrifices his own life at the end of
	<em>
	 Village
	</em>
	to save his wife and child, the series offers a follow-up story with the Shadows of Rose DLC. This DLC follows a now-teenage Rose as she figures out how to live with her superhuman abilities, and provides a little more insight into the Winters family. However, if rumors are to be believed, and
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-9-leak-protagonist-leon-s-kennedy/">
	 the next
	 <em>
		Resident Evil
	 </em>
	 game
	</a>
	focuses more on the series' past characters, it would be a letdown.

	Rose and Her Special Powers

 <p>
	The franchise's legacy characters definitely need to start making a comeback to the overall series, but that doesn't mean the franchise's newest additions to
	<em>
	 Resident Evil
	</em>
	's roster have to be dropped completely. Ethan may be long gone, but there are still plenty of questions surrounding Rose and Mia, especially the former.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-9-rose-powers-similar-characters-good/">
	 Rose and her superhuman abilities
	</a>
	can't just be swept under the rug, and if
	<em>
	 Resident Evil 9

	These powers that Rose was born with hold huge implications for the broader
	<em>
	 Resident Evil
	</em>
	universe. Furthermore, this also puts Rose in the position to be a compelling character who could teeter on the fine line between hero and villain. Such great power could potentially corrupt her into being the next big villain, or she could use it to
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-9-fantasy-chris-redfield-new-setting-rumor-leak/">
	 assist Chris Redfield
	</a>
	and his unit, especially since it seems like he's become her caretaker.

 <p>
	Ethan's wife, Mia, is a character who seems to have been completely forgotten in the grand scheme of things. In

	, she disappears after things go wrong while she's on assignment caring for the bioweapon Eveline.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-7-village-ending-mia-winters-saga-bad/">
	 Mia is an operative and researcher
	</a>
	for The Connections, a crime organization that is focused on creating various bioweapons. So, technically, Mia is a terrorist, and that's too compelling of an angle to just completely forget.

	Also, Mia is nowhere to be found in the

	Less than a week after its highly anticipated launch,
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	reached the top of the charts in over 100 regions. With over 30 million players pre-registered before the game's debut, many users expected that Kuro Games' open-world action RPG would become one of the biggest releases for the free-to-play gacha game genre in recent memory.
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/wuthering-waves/">

 <p>
	While it was only released on May 22,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	has been at the center of the gacha gaming community for quite some time now. Since it was first announced, the title's marketing was predominantly focused on
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/wuthering-waves-combat-system-guide/">
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	 ' spectacular combat
	</a>
	and fast-paced traversal mechanics, which set it apart from its direct competitors. The closed-beta tests additionally fostered even more excitement for its release. Fans praised Kuro Games' latest project and the developers' willingness to listen to their player base's feedback, with the team behind
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	even reportedly rewriting most of the script for the game in response to criticisms from the first closed beta test.

 <p>
	Though the game is an extraordinary triumph for Kuro Games,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is still dealing with a few hiccups along the road. Hundreds of players previously reported technical issues with everything ranging from graphical textures to overall stability, leading to

	 Kuro Games offering in-game compensation
	</a>
	and apologizing for the game's shaky state. Thankfully, developers have also continued to roll out daily hotfixes since release, and

	retains respectable scores of 4.3 and 4.4 stars on the Google Play and App stores respectively.

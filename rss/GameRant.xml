 <p>
  Survival games are often a testament to overcoming incredible odds, either alone or alongside friends, and persisting against harsh environments, lethal enemies, or even other players looking to get ahead. Like some other popular genres, the difficulty is the main draw to survival games. How players can not only match the odds set against them - but overcome them - has been the core feature of many popular titles today.
 </p>
 <p>
  So how can players track how well they're faring in a survival title? Building a thriving community, or really any kind of functioning base, might be a start. For some games, however, the main metric for how well a player is doing is how technologically advanced they are. These survival games, in particular, have incredibly expansive tech trees - either spanning a set of 'eras' from the Stone Age to the Space Age or keeping to a more consistent theme - but with loads of options for players to research and explore.

  Few survival or management games offer the difficulty and immersion that
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  does. Hardly a game for the faint-hearted,
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  is constantly pushing players to their limits with grueling events and ever-shifting environments to adapt to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of this adaptation is steadily progressing in technology.
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  is an interesting spin on typical tech trees as players tend to start in the 'middle' of it. If it means a better-defended settlement, ancient crafts of metallurgy or herbal medicine can be researched right alongside robotic and technological innovations that push players closer to finally building a ship.

 <p>
  Taking a much more focused and tense approach to survival than most games in this genre,
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  instills in the player early on in the main campaign that surviving in the Amazon is a temporary affair - only needed while searching for the protagonist's wife.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means players won't be researching a tech tree that includes high-tech prefabs, air-conditioning, or anything beyond what could feasibly be strung together with fiber and wood. Within these constraints of an 'improvised' technology tree, however,
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  still manages to offer an incredible amount of variety and individuality to what can be researched and crafted.

  At the opposite end of the spectrum to the focused style of
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  's tech tree is the colossal collection of engrams that comprises
  <em>
   Ark: Survival Ascended
  </em>
  's technology tree. In
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  , wooden palisades will give way to stone walls and eventually a colossal, high-tech steel base.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players level up and learn new engrams, these technologies will underpin everything they do, from clothing themselves to taming animals, to engaging in combat. Few games have a tech tree that encompasses the same breadth of technologies as
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  .

  Standing out as an incredible title among some stiff competition in the sci-fi survival genre,
  <em>
   Icarus
  </em>
  has players explore a warped, failed terraforming experiment while building up an expansive tech tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  A great game for those who love hard sci-fi,
  <em>
   Icarus
  </em>
  doesn't encompass different 'eras' of technological progression like
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  but instead goes from low-tech to high-tech sci-fi as players continue finding more resources to craft.

  Exploring a fantastical, Norse-inspired world, there is a myriad of crafting benches that players can use in
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  to improve their combat and defense capabilities, and each of these benches expands the tech tree with tiered products based on what resources are used.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a classic survival formula and one that
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  utilizes perfectly. This tech tree is oriented towards combat, in a similar fashion to something like
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  , as many of the magical beasts in this land are not in a talking mood.

  Crafting is paramount to survival in this title. Players might be able to scrape by on scavenged gear and hastily crafted weapons for the first six days, but the seventh day brings a level of intensity that the unprepared won't be able to handle.

  From the humble beginnings of the copper shortsword and tin pickaxes,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  swells to encompass a truly staggering amount of gear within its tech tree. High-tech, futuristic weaponry, fabled artifacts of myth, and weapons forged from the very flesh of gods wait in the higher tiers of this technology tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can follow this tech tree in a non-linear fashion, with plenty of 'horizontal' options to specialize in instead of just continually working upwards to the next, objectively best tool for their class. It's an incredibly broad, satisfying experience for new
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  fans and veterans alike.

  leans more toward its moment-to-moment action gameplay, it offers a fair amount of weapon and outfit customization as well. You can often create one outfit suited for sneaking around machines, while another might be better for melee or ranged combat.

  In
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  , you can enjoy the effects of two outfits, but this feature is
  <strong>
   not available in the original version
  </strong>
  . A recent patch for the Remastered edition introduced the transmog feature, allowing you to keep the stats and effects of one outfit while wearing the appearance of another. Now, you no longer have to settle for an unattractive outfit just because you need its stats.

  If you want to use the effects of two outfits, there are a few important things to keep in mind. The technique described below
  <strong>
   doesn't work with all outfits
  </strong>
  . While one of the outfits can be any of your choice, the other must be one of the following three:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Banuk Werak Runner
  </li>
  <li>
   Banuk Werak Chieftain
  </li>
  <li>
   Banuk Werak Chieftain Adept (only available in New Game Plus)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     You can't use the method described earlier at the start of the game, as the outfits mentioned above are only available in the Frozen Wilds DLC area. Fortunately, you don’t need to complete the base game to gain access to it.

  If you want the Banuk Werak Chieftain, the better of the two outfits, you’ll need to complete the "
  <strong>
   For the Werak
  </strong>
  " quest, which is the third main quest of the
  <em>
   Frozen Wilds
  </em>
  DLC. You'll want to have your best gear equipped, as this mission can be quite challenging. Alternatively, you can lower the difficulty to Story mode to complete the quest and unlock the outfit more quickly.

 <p>
  First, equip any outfit you prefer, ensuring it’s the one with the stats you want. Keep in mind that you can improve an outfit’s stats using Weaves. Once you’ve selected your ideal first outfit,
  <strong>
   use the transmog feature to apply the appearance
  </strong>
  of one of these three outfits. While these outfits don’t provide additional stats, they do offer automatic healing after taking damage for a while.
 </p>
 <p>
  This method allows you to keep the stats of your chosen outfit while gaining the auto-healing perk from any of these outfits. If your first outfit is the Shield Weaver, you’re essentially unstoppable, as you rarely take damage. And in the rare instances you do, the Banuk Werak outfits’ healing perk will automatically kick in after a short delay.

    <p>
     The healing perk of the Chieftain and Chieftain Adept outfits activates much faster than the Banuk Werak Runner's, so try to use these outfits if you have them.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  announced the debut of Gigantamax Kingler on February 1. Last year,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  received one of the most eagerly awaited updates by players, finally adding the Dynamax and Gigantamax forms. Since then, the devs have been gradually expanding the list of these variants available in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gigantamax is a type of Dynamax that not only increases in size and strength of a Pokemon but also changes in appearance and grants exclusive abilities called G-Max Moves. While in the main series games, there are 32 pocket monsters capable of Gigantamaxing, there are only six of these in Niantic's game, with the addition of Gigantamax Lapras to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  being the most recent. However, this list will soon increase after the developers confirmed a new event beginning in the coming weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gigantamax Kingler will debut in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  on February 1 in the upcoming Max Battle Day. The event will run from 2 to 5 pm local time and will make the Water-type Pokemon available for the first time in six-star Max Battles, with trainers having the chance to encounter a shiny one. To help their teams, players can use Max Mushrooms, the controversial
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  item that temporarily increases all damage dealt by Dynamax and Gigantamax critters in Max Battles.

 <p>
  Max Battle Day is one of February's events, but it's not the first confirmed for next month. Niantic recently revealed the Lunar New Year event, which will begin on January 29 and end on February 1. While Gigantamax Kingler won't debut in the augmented reality game, players have other exciting events to look forward to. One of them will be the return of Shadow Ho-Oh in a Shadow Raid Day on January 19, with more Galar Pokemon coming to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  in the next few days.

      <title>PSA: Marvel Rivals’ Doctor Strange Portal Ruse Has an Obvious Counterplay</title>

 <p>
  Innumerable clips have now shown how Doctor Strange players in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  have conjured portals at the beginning of matches to trick opponents into unknowingly leaping out of bounds and KOing themselves. This will be edged out of most
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  matches aside from the rare occurrence when a Doctor Strange player is attempting to be cheeky, and with more players learning about it daily—perhaps the hard way through experience themselves—they aren’t likely to fall for it much longer.

  ’ Doctor Stephen Strange is a nuanced Vanguard and his Pentagram of Farallah ability is easily one of the most creative and opportunistic of any character on the roster. It’s certainly impressive being able to instant transmission through a loop, and how Doctor Strange mains have managed to flank or fool opponents is hysterically inventive and humorous. Players aren’t going to be bamboozled by mystical portals forever in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . But, as long as Doctor Strange’s subversive tactics are fresh, it may be invaluable to know that players can tell the difference between a teammate’s portals and an enemy’s portals from a mile away.

  If this was common sense by now then surely fewer people would be falling for enemy schemes. However, it’s true that it can be difficult to resist hopping into any portal manifested before players if only to experience its satisfying real-time teleportation gimmick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Likewise, the success rate of this troll can probably be attributed to the fact that players were sneakily placing their portal directly in front of an enemy Doctor Strange who was mid-animation producing their own portals, meaning that opponents would naturally assume a portal there would be their teammates’ and not the enemy’s. Nowadays, Doctor Strange’s portals are implemented more in blocking chokes with looping obstructions that prevent enemy progression on a map, which is brilliant in Convergence/Convoy matches on maps such as Klyntar’s Symbiotic Surface.

 <p>
  Positioning them immediately as a match begins has been fruitful because it either helps teammates reach a control point or choke quicker while also taking advantage of enemies’ lack of situational awareness right as Galacta allows them to rush out of their spawn room. On the other hand, a clutch portal at the end of a match can clinch a point and prevent a loss. If Wong is ever introduced to
  <em>

  </em>
  ’ roster in the future, it would be exciting to see if he, too, could summon portals for a similar effect.

  oddly only considers Doctor Strange to be a two-star character in terms of difficulty. He certainly thrives with terrific healers around, and yet Doctor Strange is arguably one of the more methodical tanks to play due to how little he has available in his kit. Doctor Strange wields a lot of slick portal tech, even in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ infancy, but as players become more accustomed to enemy strategies and such strategies become ubiquitously known via viral memes there will inevitably be counters for all stealthy techniques a character may be harboring.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this character’s case, simply taking a moment to observe what color a portal’s swirling border is can thwart an enemy Sorcerer Supreme’s deception. Of course, players can simply invoke Cosmic Selection on

  ’ competitive Diamond rank and higher and ban whoever they believe is overpowered, anyhow.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared a fantastic discovery with the RPG’s community, showcasing a statue of Walton Goggins’ The Ghoul from Amazon Prime’s series. Thanks to
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  ’s in-depth lore and rich world-building, the team of creatives behind the adaptation, including creators Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, managed to flesh out their original ideas while still staying true to the source material, and giving an expansive narrative to one of the game’s Ghouls has proven to be one of the show’s strong points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Created by Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, the post-apocalyptic RPG game series first gained popularity in 1997 under Black Isle Studios, before being passed to Bethesda in 2008. The Game Awards 2024 nominated two of this year’s most popular video game adaptations, and the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series managed to beat
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  for the crown. While the
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  Netflix show has concluded with its second season,
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans are all ears to hear what’s in store for Amazon’s successor season out in the wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  Posted on Reddit by NatureHates, photos were posted in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  subreddit, showing a fan posing beside a detailed statue of The Ghoul.
  <em>
   Sons of Anarchy
  </em>
  actor Goggins brought The Ghoul to life in the adaptation, and the statue is based on the live-action version, identified by its gunslinger apparel and cowboy hat.
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is finally letting wastelanders play as a Ghoul, which is thanks in part to the live-action series’ success.

 <p>
  The original poster confirmed the statue is located at Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, and several Redditors noted the location with the hopes of visiting the attraction in the future. Additionally, more onlookers noticed there was a small statue of Godzilla hiding in the background as well. This isn’t the first time a fan has spotted a wasteland relic in the real world, as another
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  player stumbled upon a Nuka-Cola motorcycle outside their place of work.

  Becoming one of the most popular video game adaptations of all time is no small feat, considering the slew of bad-to-mediocre live-actions that came before, including the
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  movies.
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  and HBO’s
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  have certainly shown fans these ambitious adaptations can be achieved, and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  is expected to continue that winning streak. A
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  producer has teased a
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  location thought to be in season 2, and fans have also been trying to predict the relationship that will develop between Ella Purnell’s Lucy and Goggins’ Ghoul.

  Francesca is a beautiful character, whose elven heritage and status as a sorceress ensures that her looks could make any man's jaw drop.

 </p>
 <p>
  While the true extent of her power isn't known, the fact that she was chosen to be the leader of the elves of Dol Blathanna showed that everyone respected her might as a sorceress. She is certainly not a character to be trifled with unless a poor soul wants to be fried inside out by her magical powers.

 <p>
  Lambert is one of the most powerful witchers in the series, showing off his ability time and time again during the games when he's given his chance to shine. While he can possibly die in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  based on Geralt's inaction, most players will rescue this character in time and let him show off more of his skills against the Wild Hunt.
 </p>
 <p>
  He resents how his life was stolen from him as he was forced to become a witcher, but Lambert doesn't let his frustration over his torrid past marr his combat readiness. He may be a bit too emotional at times, but there's no denying that he's one of the
  <strong>
   strongest
   <em>
    Witcher
   </em>
   characters
  </strong>
  when he puts his mind to something.

 <p>
  One of Geralt's closest friends who's been with the witcher through thick and thin, it's easy to see why Eskel is such a
  <strong>
   strong character in
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Witcher
   </strong>
  </em>
  . He's a witcher who can obliterate enemies with his swift swordplay and smart use of witcher Signs.
 </p>
 <p>
  He may not be as powerful as the White Wolf himself, but that shouldn't take away from Eskel's allure as a powerful warrior in the slightest. When push comes to shove, he can pull his weight and then some. The fact that he manages to hold his own against the might of Caranthir for a lengthy period is a testament to his skill as a witcher, and it's a shame that the Netflix series did not give his legacy the respect it deserved.

 <p>
  <em>
   Hearts of Stone
  </em>
  is one of two exemplary DLCs released for the game, showing some amazing narrative chops as players embarked on another chapter with Geralt as they tried to break the curse placed upon them by Gaunter O'Dimm, the Man of Glass. The scar on his face serves as a way to tie them both together, and Geralt has to do O'Dimm's bidding for quite some time as they enlist Olgierd's help to figure out how to get rid of the curse.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players decide to give Olgierd a taste of his own medicine when his gang is burning down the villa they had their first encounter in, they must be prepared to engage in a challenging duel. Even though he's just a human, Olgierd's sword-fighting skills are a force to be reckoned with. Geralt will have his work cut out for him as he tries to take out this charismatic individual, who pushes the witcher to his very limits only to be beheaded. However, instead of dying, Olgierd casually screws his head back on in a cutscene many people missed, displaying the powers of immortality he's been cursed with.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Fringilla is one of the more interesting sorceresses in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  . Just like many other characters in the series, she also develops a soft spot for Geralt, even if their relationship doesn't amount to anything substantial. Ultimately, Geralt simply can't get over his feelings for Yennefer, and his relationship with this sorceress is soured as a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  As one would expect from any powerful sorcerer, Fringilla is one of the most
  <strong>
   powerful characters in
   <em>
    The Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Her mastery over magic is truly impressive, and it helps that this character has the wits to aid her power in battle, allowing her to strategize on the fly and use powerful magical spells whenever the situation demands the same.

 <p>
  A sorceress who serves as a thorn in Geralt's side during the second
  <em>
   Witcher
  </em>
  game, Sile de Tansarville is a conniving sorceress who dedicated her time to research and shied away from power-hungry political moves. So, Geralt and the player were surprised in equal measure to find out that she played an active role in the assassination of the king of Aedirn, Demavend.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was more invested in magical research as opposed to making power plays, so it was rather odd to see that Sile didn't realize that her megascope had been tampered with when she tried to escape from Loc Muinne. Geralt can save her in this instance, but this doesn't have major ramifications in the third game since the White Wolf can find her in a cell, where she has been tortured to the point where the only respite Geralt can offer her is a swift, honorable death.
 </p>
 <p>
  All these instances may fool people into thinking that Sile wasn't as powerful as everyone made her out to be, but that's an erroneous train of thought given the amazing power she wields as a sorceress, even if her aptitude in battle isn't tested in either the books or the games.

  Despite being a mere human without any mutated abilities or magical powers, Leo Bonhart is one of the most skilled fighters in the entire series and a bounty hunter worth his salt.

  Ciri had to get over her fear of Bonhart to finally end his life after a duel for the ages, finally making the man pay for the many times he'd terrorized her. One can only imagine how much more powerful Bonhart would've been if his natural aptitude for combat was further enhanced by the potions witchers used to hone their senses.

  It takes someone special to educate some of the strongest sorceresses of all time, making Tissaia de Vries someone truly special who is, quite unfortunately, shoved under the limelight time and time again simply because she doesn't show the true destructive nature of her powers. However, it doesn't take an expert to gauge that she's one of the most
  <strong>
   powerful characters in
   <em>
    The Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It helps that she's extremely wise to boot, and can sniff out a person's potential with just a simple test or two. She's wise beyond her years and can retain a cool, calm, and composed demeanor no matter the situation that she faces. In many ways, maintaining her clarity of mind at all times makes her stronger than any powerful mage with a short temper.

  Though on the younger side, when it comes to being a powerful sorceress, Triss was able to learn quickly to become a very
  <strong>
   strong character in
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    <strong>
     The
    </strong>
    Witcher
   </strong>
  </em>
  . She knows a vast amount of magical spells that have helped many protagonists and have killed many enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Triss has made it through many battles, coming out of them alive due to her intelligence and strong magical abilities. She has been in crucial roles in politics for most of her life, leading her to gain great strategic knowledge. Despite the restrictions placed on fire magic in the Netflix series, this redheaded sorceress uses a bevy of fire magic to decimate her opponents in the games. Oddly, this expertise isn't present in the books, with the most impressive moment for this magician coming in the form of a hailstorm she summons along with Yennefer during the Pogrom in Rivia.

  All of her traits, along with her intense magical abilities, make Yennefer a nearly unbeatable character in the series since she will fight at no limits to ensure she gets what she wants.

 <p>
  The introduction of Regis is one of the most memorable events in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Blood &amp; Wine
  </em>
  , with many fans of the books loving the fact that this man survived his encounter against Vilgefortz and will play a major role in this amazing expansion. Despite his aged nature and the tendency to not drink any blood, no matter how strong his urges are, Regis is a very powerful higher vampire who can easily rip his foes into shreds.
 </p>
 <p>
  He is saved by Dettlaff after almost dying at the hands of Vilgefortz's fiery attack and owes a debt of gratitude to this vampire. However, this doesn't change the fact that he must take the side of good and fight Dettlaff before the man can completely ruin the beautiful city of Beauclair out of revenge... and a broken heart, too.

    Loses his life to Eredin near the end of the Battle of Kaer Morhen
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It's only a given that the witcher who served as a mentor to a new batch of these mutants following the sacking of Kaer Morhen would be one of the
  <strong>
   strongest characters in
   <em>
    The Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Vesemir is no slouch, and his sword-fighting skills are truly a thing of beauty. It's a shame that he met his end during the battle against the Wild Hunt, with the lovable Witcher sacrificing his own life to save Ciri from being captured by this heinous group.
 </p>
 <p>
  If he wasn't distracted during the battle, he could've easily dealt with most of the Wild Hunt. However, his love for Ciri resulted in him making the ultimate sacrifice, with all the fighters in Kaer Morhen mourning the loss of their mentor in such a cruel and unfair manner.

   <strong>
    The King of the Wild Hunt and the antagonist of the base game
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin, had immaculate power that led him to be in the position he was in. His raw power, strategic abilities, and intellect made him able to conquer any feat he wished alongside his battalion. He is the main antagonist throughout the third game's main story and ends up causing some major damage to his enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eredin is talented with magic, teleportation, ice conjuring, and fighting with weapons. He's no slouch in battle, and Geralt had to pull out every move in his arsenal to beat down this powerful foe and end his hunt for Ciri after a long and arduous journey.

  The main antagonist of the book series and later mentioned in the games, Vilgefortz is one of the most powerful magic users to exist in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  franchise. He was a leader in the Chapter of Sorcerers and was incredibly power-hungry. He wanted Ciri's blood to gain her Elder Blood powers, which would arguably make him unstoppable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Vilgefortz was able to take down Geralt without even using his highly advanced magic and imprisoned and tortured Yennefer before the two were eventually able to defeat him. Even this could only be accomplished with the help of the vampire Regis and an enchanted amulet Geralt was gifted.

Suffice it to say, players will die over and over again to the transformed Dettlaff before eventually being victorious against a worthy foe.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's true that Dettlaff was a lover scorned by Syanna, that didn't excuse his destructive actions in the slightest. He brought this fate upon himself, and even Regis couldn't deny the fact that his dear friend needed to be put down once and for all.

  Players should check out the first Witcher game if they want to see the imposing antagonist that Geralt had to deal with at the end of his adventure. Jacques de Aldersberg is the Grandmaster of the White Rose and a man that no one should trifle with, but Geralt is no man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only does he chase down Jacques all the way to a world ruined by the White Frost, but he also kills this villain after an epic duel. Keen-eyed players will pick up on the many hints given by this character, connecting him to Alvin, a young boy with the power to channel Source who disappears partway through the game. It turns out that he traveled backward in time and used everything he learned to become a powerful figure. There's no denying that he's one of the
  <strong>
   strongest
   <em>
    Witcher
   </em>
   characters
  </strong>
  and could've easily bested Geralt in battle if he had received sufficient training on how to control these mysterious powers.

      <title>What to Expect From Slay The Spire 2 in 2025</title>

 <p>
  The original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  is generally considered a pioneer among roguelite deck builders, so with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Slay The Spire 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  expected to release in early access soon, there’s naturally a lot of hype surrounding the upcoming sequel. However, while 2025 will be a big year for
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  , the sequel is only expected to be available on PC platforms during its early access period, so the full game and its release on additional platforms may not arrive until after 2025.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Based on what’s been revealed,
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  will retain a similar gameplay loop to the original game, except with several twists and improvements, including new and returning playable characters, new gameplay mechanics, and fully updated visuals. Even though the full game won’t be available during
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  ’s early access period, the upcoming sequel will surely provide a fresh experience for returning players, as well as a golden opportunity for newcomers to join in on the addicting fun of the beloved franchise ahead of the game’s full release.

 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-is-coming-to-early-access-on-pc-in-2025">
  Slay The Spire 2 Is Coming to Early Access on PC in 2025
 </h3>
 <p>
  As confirmed by the recent trailer shown off at The Game Awards 2024,
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  will be coming to early access on PC platforms sometime in 2025, specifically via Steam. Since the early access period for the original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  lasted for around a year and a half,
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  could repeat a similar release schedule. Considering that 2025 is fast approaching and there’s still no exact release date, the upcoming sequel may not be available until later in the year, with its full release highly unlikely to arrive throughout 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the full game and its release outside of PC platforms is unlikely to arrive in 2025, regardless, this will still be a big year for the franchise that has significantly influenced an entire genre of PvE roguelite deck builders. The studio behind
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  heavily credits its success to early access, so whether players will be returning from the first game or if the sequel will be their first experience with the franchise,
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2

  How Slay The Spire 2 Builds on the Original Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  The upcoming sequel to
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  will retain a familiar gameplay loop from the original, except with an all-new look thanks to fully updated artwork for returning characters, cards, and enemies.
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  will also introduce new gameplay mechanics that expand upon the new and returning buildcrafting tools, one of these new gameplay mechanics revealed so far is the ability to curse cards with permanent buffs associated with debuffs and other side effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another thing revealed about the upcoming sequel is that it will take place 1,000 years after the original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  . While it’s unclear how this new setting will affect the minute-to-minute gameplay, this will surely come into play for players who can reach the endgame of
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>

  It’s been confirmed that
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  will feature both new and returning playable characters, some of which won’t be available until the full release. Ahead of
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  ’s early access coming in 2025, four playable characters have already been revealed:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ironclad
  </li>
  <li>
   Silent
  </li>
  <li>
   Necrobinder
  </li>
  <li>
   “??????”
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-rsquo-s-ironclad-character-explained">
  Slay The Spire 2’s Ironclad Character Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ironclad is a returning character who is expected to retain their overall class identity, except with a mix of new buildcrafting tools. The Ironclad character from the original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  is generally considered a well-rounded character class with a natural self-healing relic and several defensive abilities, although their attacks are rather basic compared to other characters.
 </p>
 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-rsquo-s-silent-character-explained">
  Slay The Spire 2’s Silent Character Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  Silent is another returning character confirmed for
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  ’s early access. Silent specializes in debuffs and poison status effects, and while their individual attacks are relatively weak, they can often be chained together in long, devastating combos.
 </p>
 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-rsquo-s-necrobinder-character-explained">
  Slay The Spire 2’s Necrobinder Character Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Necrobinder is a new character appearing in the sequel who will be accompanied by their companion Osty. While this character’s full ability kit has yet to be revealed, having necromancy powers and a permanent companion is expected to present a variety of new playstyles and buildcrafting options compared to the characters from the original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-rsquo-s-mysterious-fourth-character-explained">
  Slay the Spire 2’s Mysterious Fourth Character Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  A total of four playable characters have already been confirmed to be available during
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  ’s early access, though little to no information about the fourth character has been revealed outside of their appearance. So far, the popular theory among the game’s community is that this character could be a sentry class with abilities and attacks that reactivate on consecutive turns.
 </p>
 <h3 id="slay-the-spire-2-rsquo-s-roster-of-playable-characters-will-continue-to-grow">

 <p>
  While some of the features that will be available during
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  ’s early access have yet to be revealed, there are expected to be more than four characters available, with more potentially coming when the game fully releases. This will likely include the Defect and Watcher from the original
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  as returning characters, though any characters beyond this currently remain a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game draws closer to its early access release date players will surely learn more about the playable characters and other new features coming in
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  , although the game’s full release is still likely a while away. In the meantime,
  <em>
   Slay The Spire 2
  </em>
  is already shaping up to build upon the original game in major ways, so the 2025 early access will still be worth checking out for both new and returning players.

  2018's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Subnautica
   </strong>
  </em>
  proved an unexpected hit. The series quickly resonated with players for their meticulously crafted environments and the uniquely alien creatures that inhabited them, creating an atmosphere that blurred the line between survival horror and diving simulator. With
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  being such a popular game, it made sense that Unknown Worlds would want to make a sequel, which was revealed to the public in 2024 with the teaser for
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  There isn't a lot of information about
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  just yet, beyond some glimpses of the new protagonists and the introduction of co-op gameplay. However, there are some fascinating things
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  could do to build on its predecessors.

  The Cyclops was the biggest vehicle used by Riley Robinson in the original
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  . It was difficult to build, requiring several components to be found in fragments before it could be assembled, but built it was an effective means of travel that could get him around the crater quickly. It also had the advantage of a customizable interior that Riley could build onto, allowing it to function something like a mobile base. This vehicle quickly became a fan favorite. However,
  <em>
   Subnautica: Below Zero
  </em>
  chose not to include the Cyclops, instead having the sea truck fill a similar role. This has led to a lot of interest in the possibility of its return for
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  There may actually be some credence towards the idea of the iconic submarine coming back. The teaser trailer shows one of the player characters piloting what appears to be a seamoth, a smaller vehicle used in the first game. While this does not definitively prove the Cyclops will return, it does suggest that
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  will be reintroducing some familiar vehicles from the previous games.

  Virtual photography has become an increasingly popular hobby among gamers, but so far neither
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  game has included options for taking photographs of their detailed ecosystems. There is a way to take and save screenshots, but these games have some really nice visuals and deserve way more than that.
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  needs a proper photo mode. Not just "
  <em>
   press X to take a screenshot
  </em>
  ", but an actual photo mode with the full package. It should pause the game, give you a free-moving camera, and edit options including lights and contrast.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is so much in these games worth photographing. All the different sea (or land) creatures would make excellent subjects. Players would undoubtedly enjoy capturing action scenes and encounters with leviathans. Even just the player character and their vehicles would make great shots. Plus, virtual photography is also a great way to create community engagement with fans. In this one respect,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  really needs to follow the examples of other games.

  One of the coolest details of
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  and Below Zero's worldbuilding is the way the developers went as far as to include fossils of seemingly extinct creatures from a bygone era. Perhaps the most recognizable to players will be the gargantuan leviathan, the skeleton of a creature large enough to eat a sea dragon. Having more fossils for players to find would be a great way to build on the lore around it. And if Unknown Worlds is feeling particularly ambitious, they could experiment with the appearance of a living specimen. That has been a popular idea among players.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the gargantuan leviathan is far from the only prehistoric creature that could be expanded on. There is also the
  <strong>
   ancient skeleton
  </strong>
  . sometimes known as the
  <em>
   titan leviathan
  </em>
  by fans, which has even more questions associated with it, or the large bony fish known as
  <strong>
   research specimen theta
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   Below Zero
  </em>
  also introduced a mysterious trilobite-like fossil that was studied by the architects. All of these would be cool to see expanded on through new specimens;. or maybe even a living version. And of course, there would have to be some new fossils as well. By building on the existing prehistory,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  would be revealing a very interesting and different world.

  Both
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Below Zero
  </em>
  were structured around an immersive first-person perspective. This makes sense from a practical standpoint, as it saved resources on making a character model, but first-person does come with limitations. One of the biggest problems is it can be hard to see just how big some leviathans are. A third-person perspective offers a simple workaround. Having a human in view for scale makes all the difference. When you can see their size in relation to a human, it really puts things into perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, some people still love the first-person perspective, and many fans would argue that is part of what makes the
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  games so great. But it doesn't have to be an either/or decision. One option could be to simply have options to toggle between first and third person or perhaps specific scenarios where a perspective is automatically assumed. Having the option for a third-person perspective in
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  could allow a very unique experience.

  While the teaser for
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  didn't reveal much about the game's story, it did show one interesting detail: a co-op mode. In the teaser, we get to see the two playable characters: a man and a woman. We don't have any information on who these people are, including their names, other than the fact that they seem to be the two-player characters. What isn't clear yet is how much choice players will have in who they control. Will they be able to pick one, or is one automatically assigned to player 1 and the other to player 2?
 </p>
 <p>
  The ideal outcome would be for players to be given a choice at the start of the game. This could theoretically mean having duplicates of the same character while playing in multiplayer, but there are ways that can be addressed if necessary. Offering choices, especially in single-player, allows players to choose who they are comfortable playing.

 <p>
  Going deep is a big part of
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  . Both games are built around exploring and require the player to reach the deepest points of their maps to complete the story. It would make sense for
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  to follow suit, but maybe it could go further. The deepest point of Earth's oceans, the bottom of the Marianas trench, is 11 thousand meters deep, much deeper than either of
  <em>
   Subnautica's
  </em>
  maps combined. Assuming 4546B's oceans are at a similar depth, that certainly leaves room for exploration of deeper waters. This would allow room for ways to experiment with gameplay since it would get to a point where the player also has to worry about pressure, and presumably has to build equipment to handle it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would also open up some opportunities for biomes that haven't been touched yet. Despite the wide range of environments in both
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Below Zero
  </em>
  , there has never really been an equivalent of a "deep sea" biome. On Earth, the deep ocean's extreme environment can produce some bizarre and frightening creatures. The anglerfish is perhaps one of the most iconic, but there is also the gulper eel (a creature that can swallow prey bigger than itself). This biome is also home to the giant squid and the even bigger colossal squid. So lots of potential inspiration for leviathans. They could also take advantage of
  <strong>
   deep sea gigantism
  </strong>
  , a phenomenon that makes it a lot more common for creatures to evolve to be alarming size, to produce some really nasty surprises in the dark.

  Every
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  player learns to recognize The Void — the dark expanse of nothingness that surrounds the map. Traveling too far into the void will result in a warning about the "ecological dead zone" and ignoring those warnings may lead to a nasty encounter with a leviathan. It makes sense from a development standpoint, as a way of keeping you from going too far out of bounds. But what if it could be more than that? There is already a mod titled
  <em>
   Call of the Void
  </em>
  based on that exact question, even featuring a whole new biome to explore.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a fan-created mod can pull it off, then surely it would be feasible with the resources allotted to a full game. The void would be a great place to introduce a sense of looming dread. The darkness that comes from traveling deep enough would make it a lot harder to spot leviathan-class creatures, and the ocean floor could probably make for a unique biome. Allowing more room to explore the void could make for a very unique experience compared to the previous games.

  In both
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Below Zero
  </em>
  , the player gets access to new equipment and technology by finding pieces of it in the world and scanning them. Many technologies require at least three fragments to be scanned before the item can actually be made. The fragments are usually scattered around the map and have to be actively tracked down. In theory, it encourages exploration. However, in practice, it can be frustrating. With no idea of where to look, it more or less comes down to stumbling around the map until you find something by accident. While some players may enjoy this aspect, it can get frustrating and drives some to instead look up the locations online so they can build the item and move on.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this idea could be reworked with the implementation of a research mechanic as an alternative. Essentially, instead of having to track down all the fragments, the player could instead collect resources to spend on research projects as a means of getting new equipment.
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  wouldn't even have to remove the old system, just treat it as one of multiple options. They could still be used in conjunction (i.e. scanning fragments reduces research costs). This would allow multiple options for moving forward while still encouraging exploration and resource-collecting.

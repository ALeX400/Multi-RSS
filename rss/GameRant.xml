  The Energized Neck Coil is a niche accessory that can supercharge one of the best builds in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . However, like the majority of powerful items in the game, this one is hidden in an area that's very easy to overlook.

  The Energized Neck Coil is
  <strong>
   found in the Labyrinth
  </strong>
  . Specifically, it's
  <strong>
   in a hidden chamber near the Fractured Ingress checkpoint
  </strong>
  . Teleport to this checkpoint, then head up the stairs to your left. You'll be greeted by some stone guardians as soon as you reach the hub area that contains portals leading to
  <em>
   Remnant 2's
  </em>
  multiple worlds.. Get rid of them, then
  <strong>
   go to the statue at the other end of the hallway

  Look to your left, and you should be able to

   spot a small crawlspace

  . Crouch down and pass through it. This path leads to a room containing the Energized Neck Coil, though you'll have to fight a bunch of extra guardians to get to it. The amulet is on a stack of stone panels at the end, ready to be taken to a new home.

  This amulet
  <strong>
   is all about Status Effects
  </strong>
  . Not only does
  <strong>
   it increase the damage dealt by effects like Burn and Bleed by 20%, but it also triggers explosions
  </strong>
  around a 2m radius around enemies whenever you apply a Status Effect on them. The explosion effect has deals 20% of the inflicted Status Effect's total damage, and it has an unlisted cooldown of five seconds.

 <p>
  Energized Neck Coil works with any weapon or ability that inflicts Status Effects. The Twisting Wounds Mutator in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is an excellent way to give your weapon a free Bleed effect on-hit, and weapons like Hellfire or Nebula are also great for this accessory, as they innately deal elemental damage that builds up into the Burning or Corroded status effects respectively.

 <p>
  This amulet naturally works well with the Ritualist Archetype, as it focuses on inflicting and amplifying DoT damage. The extra Status Effect damage from Energized Neck Coil alone makes it a good choice, though something like the Sinister Totem that gives up to 50% bonus Status Damage may be better when it comes to high-difficulty runs or boss fights.

 <p>
  A talented
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan designed a piece of fusion fan art combining Ninetales and Umbreon. Dubbed Umbranine by the artist, the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan's artwork managed to combine several iconic features of both Pokemon into one unique design.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community can be incredibly creative when it comes to fan art for the series. Ranging from traditional fan art to more modern creations, the fan base is always finding new ways to share their love of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  in their work. Fusion fan art is particularly popular among
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans as it imagines what a combination of two or more Pokemon might look like. The community has seen a wide variety of these fusions, with some incredibly creative fans combining unlikely Pokemon duos such as Togekiss and Chandelure. However, a majority of these fusions combine Pokemon that are similar in looks, type, or design, much like what this
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan did with Ninetales and Umbreon.

  Shared on Reddit, user Verdahn showcased fusion art combining Ninetales with the Dark-type Eeveelution Umbreon. The art showcased a combination of the two Pokemon in their sprite form alongside an original art piece based off of the sprite. Like most other Pokemon fusion art, this fan's design featured iconic aspects of both Pokemon being combined. The art was primarily based on Ninetales' form, including the iconic nine tails and elegant fur, but featured Umbreon's color palette and yellow circles throughout the design.

  The artist also shared their name for the fusion, Umbranine. The design received praise from other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans online, with several people pointing out how well these two Pokemon work as a fusion. Others shared how the name made them think of a fusion including the Pokemon Arcanine instead of Ninetales and brainstormed alternate names for this specific fusion, such as Umbretales. Overall, many fans agreed that the fusion did a great job combining Umbreon and Ninetales and created a very elegant but intimidating Pokemon.

  With as dedicated a community as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  has garnered, it is no surprise to see impressive artwork such as this fusion Pokemon coming from fans of the series. While the idea of creating art combining similar Pokemon into a single fusion is nothing new,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans are still finding all sorts of unique ways to mix together some Pokemon into a single impressive design. With over a thousand Pokemon in the series, there are still numerous combinations for fans to explore.

  Side quests are a large part of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but you won't be able to really break into them until you've cleared the dungeon in Suthorn. After reaching your first objective that Impa gave you, you can explore most of Hyrule to your heart's content. One quest you'll undoubtedly find is "Up a Wall," and it's the easiest side quest in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  . It's most likely the first quest you'll take, and as such, better to complete when you're in the beginning stages of a playthrough.

  Before you can take this side quest, you'll need to clear the rift covering the Suthorn Ruins and save Minister Lefte. After this, she'll guide you to Lueberry's house, which will advance the story. Your next goal is to clear the giant rifts that opened in the Gerudo Desert and Jabul Waters.
  <em>

  </em>
  lets you choose which one to do first, but you can explore Hyrule a little before continuing the story quests.

 <p>
  Go north up the path from Lueberry's house, and you'll find a spot with nine pillars. There are some new Echoes you can learn here, including the useful Crawler, a spider monster that makes it possible to scale most surfaces. Until you get the Frog Bracelet or Platboom, the Crawler is a good Echo to use while exploring.

  Near the

   northeastern pillar

  , you'll find two Spear Moblins and a young boy named Verley standing atop the broken ruins. This will automatically start the "Up a Wall" side quest. Your goal is simple: Defeat the two Spear Moblins. You can dispatch them with the Darknut you obtained from the Suthorn Ruins rift, or you can use aerial monsters like the Keese. Spear Moblins can attack you and your Echoes from far away, so make sure to put some distance between Zelda and the enemies. Don't forget to Learn the Spear Moblin Echo once you've defeated them.

  As soon as the last Spear Moblin falls, you'll speak to Varley, who mistakes you for Link. You'll receive 20 Rupees for saving him, a modest reward and one that definitely has more use at the beginning of
  <em>
   Echoes
  </em>
  than the end. The obvious way to use Rupees is to spend them at shops. Considering there are several accessories you can get from stores around Hyrule, you may want to save the pocket change for later. Rupees can also be used to pay for smoothies or play minigames, such as Mango Rush.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  series is one of FromSoftware's most beloved titles. It's also one of the most customizable action RPGs ever, especially
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  , which is filled with tons of outfits, builds, magic, and all the weapons players could ever want.

 <p>
  However, with all the variety, one would need to separate the good from the bad and what works with a build and what doesn't. As an example, we’ll be ranking the very best weapons one would need for a quality build. A quality build is one which does not focus too much more on either Strength or Dexterity but instead increases both of them. This allows the player to use more weapons but also means that certain weapons that scale with both Strenght and Dexterity become incredibly powerful.

   <strong>
    Updated on October 2, 2024, by Aldous Foster:
   </strong>
   As players explore the lands of Lothric, they may not want to specialize too much into Strenth or Dexterity without knowing which great weapons might wait just around the next corner. Quality builds are not just a middle ground, however, as they are some weapons which benefit the most from having both high Strength and high Dexterity. These weapons can truly shine in the hands of a quality build. Players looking for these great blades should read on to find out their stats and locations.

  The Dark Sword is a weapon that looks simple enough but weighs a ton and packs a punch. It is dropped by Darkwraiths, which can be found at the High Wall of Lothric or close to the Abyss Watchers boss door at Farron Keep.

 <p>
  The weapon was quite overpowered at release but has since been nerfed. Nevertheless, it is a great weapon that works well with strength builds and quality builds alike. It is also the only straight sword with the
  <strong>
   Stomp Weapon Art
  </strong>
  , making it a good defensive option.

 <p>
  The best infusion for this sinister Straight Sword is
  <strong>
   Refined
  </strong>
  , for at +10, this grants the Dark Sword B-tier scaling in both strength and dexterity. Combined with its 198 physical attack, when fully upgraded, can lead to an excellent damage output.

 <p>
  The Estoc is an assassin class weapon that is automatically given to players choosing the
  <strong>
   Assassin Starting Class
  </strong>
  . It can also be purchased for 3000 souls from Greirat once released from his cell in the High Wall of Lothric.

 <p>
  The Estoc is not only great for players choosing the quality build but also a good sword for thrusting enemies with a shield at hand or for close-quartered but not too close combat. Its speed, its range, and the
  <strong>
   Shield Splitter Weapon Art
  </strong>
  will prove dangerous to any foe in PVP or PVE.

 <p>
  As with most other quality build weapons, the Estoc benefits the most from a Refined infusion. At the maximum level of upgrades, it will receive C-tier scaling in strength and dexterity that goes nicely with its 189 physical attack. Despite being a bit weaker than the Dark Sword, this piercing blade is a fair bit faster, and its thrust-type attacks allow it to take advantage of the extra counterattack damage exclusive to this damage type.

  Right after players have cut down their first Lord of Cinder, the Abyss Watchers, and maybe even attained a Dark Sword from the Darkwraiths roaming the area, this weapon can then be transposed from the Soul of the Blood of the Wolf.

  The Farron Greatsword is an Ultra Greatsword, especially good for quality builds. It combines a Greatsword and a dagger and has a rather unique and pleasing moveset as well. In PVE, its wide, swing-based moveset is especially useful for attacking multiple enemies at a time. However, it's quite lacking when it comes to PVP, as it can easily be parried mid-attack.

 <p>
  As a unique weapon, the Farron Greatsword cannot be infused and can only be upgraded to +5. Though, when boosted to the max with the help of Andre of Astora, it gains C-tier scaling in strength and A-tier scaling in dexterity. This is a bit strange for an Ultra Greatsword, though, likely due to this paired weapon's lightness and the inclusion of a dagger in the offhand. It should also be noted that the Farron Greatsword does
  <strong>
   20% additional damage to foes and bosses who are tied to The Abyss
  </strong>
  . This makes it great for taking out some more challenging enemies like Darkwraiths and Pus of Men as well as a few bosses like
  <strong>
   High Lord Wolnir
  </strong>
  and Darkeater Midir.

  This straight sword may seem simple at first, but it can output a ridiculous amount of damage in a very short window. Aside from its great base damage, it also has the
  <strong>
   longest reach of all the straight swords
  </strong>
  and has the joint
  <strong>
   highest critical modifier
  </strong>
  at 110. It also has the Stance Weapon Art, which deals good damage and can break through guard.

  Players wanting to find this incredible weapon will want to farm Lothric Knights, as they have a small chance to drop it. It can also be bought from Greirat for 4,000 souls after he has fully pillaged Irithyll Valley.

  At +10, the Refined infusion gives the sword a B scaling in both strength and dexterity, which makes it one of the best-quality weapons in the game. As it also has 185 physical attack and the quick attack speed of a straight sword, this weapon makes quick work of players and bosses alike.

  Murakumo can be found by heading to Irithyll Dungeon and killing Alva, Seeker of the Spurned. As the
  <strong>
   longest-curved greatsword in the game
  </strong>
  , Murakumo has the best reach. Like all curved greatswords, it has the
  <strong>
   Spin Slash Weapon Art
  </strong>
  and also has good hyper armor and deceptive animations, which make it very strong against other players.

 <p>
  It is also one of the few weapons in the game that can get a B scaling in both strength and dexterity with a Refined infusion. With this scaling and 225 physical attack at +10, Murakumo is a good option for quality builds, especially against aggressive foes or in PVP.

 <p>
  The Black Knight Sword is regarded as one of the best weapons in the game for PVE, mostly due to its high poise stance and
  <strong>
   Perseverance
  </strong>
  , which can be capitalized on to deal a good amount of damage to enemies.

 <p>
  Players can find this sword in the Smouldering Lake on a corpse. It's also a sword with decent reach and speed, and among the other Black Knight weapons, it is merciful to the stamina bar. The Black Knight Sword is a dependable sword that can take players all the way to the end of the game if treated right.

 <p>
  With moderate scaling in strength at C-tier and dexterity at D-tier, a player's stats won't add to the attack rating of the Black Knight Sword as much as its base damage will. At +5, it possesses a huge 302 physical attack as well as a 20% damage bonus against all demonic enemies.

 <p>
  The Black Knight Greataxe is another fantastic choice for PVE. This weapon can be attained as a drop from Black Knights wielding a Greataxe with some good RNG. It is an excellent weapon with incredible damage, a variety of moves, and a wide range to boot.

 <p>
  For more reasons as to why this weapon is so great, its weapon art,
  <strong>
   War Cry
  </strong>
  , adds a 10% damage boost. It also naturally deals with 20% damage to demons, like all black knight weapons, making it a solid choice for a particular location in the game.

 <p>
  Much like the Black Knight Sword, this devastating Greataxe possesses C-tier scaling in strength and D-tier scaling in dexterity. However, its massive 350 physical attack at +5 makes it a fair bit more dangerous. The weapon skill also grants it a unique attack combo that bestows some hyper armor for a great way to poise through almost any attack while unleashing devastation in return.

  After players have finally defeated Pontiff Sulyvahn, some would either use up his Soul due to the sheer annoyance and frustration of the fight or transpose it with 3000 souls to acquire the Profaned Greatsword, which is a fantastic weapon for both PVP and PVE.

  It deals an impressive amount of damage but is only at its best with a quality build. Although it may not be an end-game boss killer, it is still an excellent weapon to use before moving on to a better one later in the game.

 <p>
  With C-tier scaling in both strength and dexterity, the Profaned Greatsword is pretty much locked into a quality build-only niche. However, 294 physical attack when fully upgraded to +5 is nothing to laugh at. Especially when one uses its unique skill,
  <strong>
   Profaned Flame
  </strong>
  , to give it a natural fire buff that enhances its deadliness.

  The Claymore can either be attained from enemies wielding it in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley or in the High Wall of Lothric near the firebreathing dragon. It is perhaps the most balanced of all the Greatswords, with a mix of range, speed, and damage.

  It has a great move set and works well with strength and quality builds especially. It has a wide swing that easily staggers and crushes weaker foes and a good thrust that's good for fighting other players in PVP.

 <p>
  With a Refined infusion, the Claymore gains C-tier scaling in strength and dexterity at +10, as well as a sufficient 248 physical attack stat. This Greatsword's weapon skill, Stance, is the variant that can break a foe's guard with a light attack and deliver a devastating upward slash and lunge with a strong attack.

  These paired swords can quickly tear through enemies and can absolutely destroy boss health bars. They have the
  <strong>
   longest reach of all paired straight swords
  </strong>
  and can combo from attacks into the Spin Slash Weapon Art, which makes them very popular against other players too. To obtain them, the player must first defeat Aldrich, Yhorm, and the Abyss Watchers. Then these excellent blades can be found just outside the Grand Archives.

  In addition to their extremely fast attack speed and the powerful physical attack of 180, they also have a B scaling in strength and dexterity. This makes these blades one of the most reliable ways to tear through even the toughest bosses and is one of the best options for any quality builds.

  The Astora Greatsword is the

  The Astora Greatsword is a sword that generally favors the stamina bar. Like other Ultra Greatswords, it has a long reach, and while it's better for PVE, in PVP, its Weapon Art can deal a devastating amount of damage to opponents. For quality builds, infusing it with Refined is the best.

  At +10, Refined infusion grants excellent B-tier scaling in both strength and dexterity; some of the highest dual-scaling of any quality build weapon alongside the Dark Sword. 237 physical attack may not be much compared to other Ultra Greatswords, though its stamina-conservative attacks mean that it can unleash more of them without needing to rest for higher overall damage per second.

 <p>
  The Exile Greatsword is by far the
  <strong>
   best curved Greatsword
  </strong>
  as it deals the most damage of all the curved swords but at the cost of terrible range. Its weapon art, Spin Slash, is an especially useful skill that deals massive damage to enemies around the wielder.

 <p>
  The weapon can be attained from the Farron Keep and is held by one of the two Exile Watchdogs near the ladder. When it comes to curved Greatswords, it is the most used for quality builds.

 <p>
  B-tier scaling in strength and dexterity yields an excellent attack rating when combined with the Exile Greatsword's 266 physical attack at +10 Refined infusion. This weapon, like many others in its class, is ideal for staggering foes and stunlocking them into an early grave.

  This shattered blade is obtained by Transposing the Soul of Slave Knight Gael and offers the player some excellent damage and quick movement. As it is obtained from the final boss of the Ringed City DLC, it is certainly a late game item and requires a lot of work to get.

 <p>
  Its Weapon Art is
  <strong>
   Blade of Peril
  </strong>
  , which sends the player flying into a jumping attack that can then be followed up with a wide sweep or a strong slam. This gives the player the ability to either take out a group of enemies at once or deal massive damage to a single target.

  With decent scaling in both Strength and Dexterity, this blade shines in the hands of a quality build where its massive 268 base damage can make quick work of even the toughest late-game foes.

  When it comes to quality builds, players cannot go wrong with the Hollowslayer Greatsword. It can be earned after defeating the Curse-Rotted Greatwood via Soul transposition with the Soul of the Rotted Greatwood and 1000 souls.
 </p>

 <p>
  As the name suggests, it is especially useful against hollows as it deals an additional 20% damage to them, which is a plus as most enemies in the game are hollowed. It is also very adaptable, as players can wield it with one hand and a shield, which is especially useful in PVP situations.

 <p>
  D-tier scaling in strength and C-tier in dexterity offset this blade's power for game-balancing, though 264 physical attack at the max +5 is more than enough to slay hollows, as this Greatsword's name implies. Beyond common hollowed foes, its damage bonus can be quite handy on certain bosses as well, such as the
  <strong>
   Deacons of the Deep
  </strong>
  and the later phases of
  <strong>
   Slave Knight Gael
  </strong>
  .

  As a probationary officer,
  <strong>
   Carmine Costello
  </strong>
  — played by
  <strong>
   52chains
  </strong>
  — is trying to rebuild his career after losing his job as the warden of the prison he named "Dog Town." Despite being an easy target for teasing from criminals, gangs, and even his fellow officers, Carmine is taking his new role seriously, dedicating himself to solving criminal cases while still maintaining a playful side.

 <p>
  52chains and streamers like him are crucial to the NoPixel roleplay server because they bring characters like Carmine to life, blending serious police work with moments of levity and interaction with criminals. By playing a character who doesn’t always fit the typical "tough cop" mold, 52chains adds depth and unpredictability to the police force, making for more engaging and dynamic roleplay.

  <strong>
   Travpiper
  </strong>
  has recently made his return to the NoPixel community with his new police character,
  <strong>
   Tyler Peters
  </strong>
  . Following his previous role as William Gunner in NoPixel 3.0, Travpiper has brought back the same high-energy, unpredictable roleplay in Tyler. Although he has earned the title of Assistant Chief of Police, Tyler Peters is far from the typical serious cop. Instead, he injects an unserious, playful energy into the police force, often landing himself in hot water for his antics.

 <p>
  Streamers who play characters such as Tyler are highly valued because they bring hefty doses of humor to otherwise serious roles. By pushing the boundaries of what’s expected from a cop character, Travpiper adds a layer of unpredictability that keeps other players on their toes and his hilarious character keeps viewers thoroughly entertained.

  The streamer known as

  plays Officer
  <strong>
   Opal Pryce
  </strong>
  , a character who has quickly captured the hearts of the NoPixel community. Known for her quiet and innocent demeanor, Opal stands out from the more boisterous characters on the server, yet her confidence has steadily grown as she climbs the ranks in the police force. Opal has formed ties with the infamous Chang Gang — a group notorious for violent and terroristic actions — making her lisajfc famous amongst CG viewers.

 <p>
  Opal's evolution from shy, insecure officer to a dependable and strategic member of the police force shows character growth, which is highly valued in the roleplay community. By portraying Opal Pryce as a more introverted officer who still finds her place in a high-stakes world, lisajfc creates compelling, character-driven roleplay that resonates with both players and viewers.

  <strong>
   EsfandTV
  </strong>
  brings one of NoPixel's most iconic characters to life with
  <strong>
   Cletus Cornwood
  </strong>
  , captain of the BCSO and dedicated Police Liaison in the city council. Despite coming in second to Jeffrey Bones in the sheriff election, Cornwood has remained relentless in his mission to improve law enforcement and uplift the lives of all characters.

 <p>
  While some viewers and criminal streamers might feel that police characters take their roles too seriously — killing roleplay by imposing jail sentences and hefty fines — Cornwood and his fellow officers play a crucial role in shaping the server's narrative. They inspire fresh roleplay arcs and introduce necessary consequences for criminal activities. Without these stakes, the thrill of the chase and the intricacies of roleplay would diminish, leading to a less engaging experience for everyone involved. For these reasons and many others, EsfandTV is among the best streamers in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  roleplay.

 <p>
  The first-person shooter is among the most saturated video game genres in the modern day, recently enjoying a resurgence in the boomer shooter subgenre. This sub-genre is particularly notable for its use of pixelated textures and 2D, pixel-art sprites.

  While not all first-person shooters in this niche make use of 2D characters in 3D environments, many of them do. These are just a few excellent examples of modern shooters with an old-school, pixelated look.

  <em>
   Fashion Police Squad

  This psychedelic action roguelike has players speeding through various rooms and corridors at a breakneck pace, taking out enemies as fast as they can on their way to the exit. To be successful, players must blast their way through each zone before the liquid in their idol runs out, representing a constantly-draining health bar.

  frantic, chaotic gameplay is only matched by its psychedelic, pixel-art style. 2D, pixelated sprites represent the various unhinged enemies in the game, as well as the player's skinny arms and arsenal of snappy guns. The environments are painted in pixelated textures, featuring a vast array of bright colors that can frequently be disorientating.

  -inspired old-school FPS is packed with punchy gunfights and a low-resolution, pixelated art-style.

  2D, pixelated enemies are plentiful, giving players plenty of reasons to use their arsenal of old-school weaponry. Furthermore, despite the environments using a variety of pixelated textures, atmospheric lighting prevents the screen from getting too messy.

  <em>
   Fortune's Run
  </em>
  is a strange game that's slow to start, but players that are patient with its slower pace will find a truly distinctive experience that offers a combination of tactical stealth and fast-paced action gameplay. The slower pace of the game, in comparison to other boomer-shooters, can likely be attributed to the game's implementation of immersive-sim elements.

  ),
  <strong>

  , and
  <em>
   Blood

  influences are apparent from the get-go in

   Ion Fury

  <em>
   Ion Fury

  is a retro shooter through-and-through, with a pixelized aesthetic to boot.

  This high-octane gore-fest is a fast-paced boomer shooter that puts players in the hulking shoes of an Ultramarine.
  <em>

    Warhammer 40k: Boltgun

  As with all boomer shooters,
  <em>
   Boltgun
  </em>
  takes a great deal of inspiration from classic 90s shooters, both in its visuals and its gameplay. However, the faithfully recreated Warhammer 40k setting, excessive gore, and a chainsword allow
  <em>
   Boltgun
  </em>
  to stand out among the crowd.

  <em>
   CULTIC's
  </em>
  gameplay is non-stop, action-packed fun with a dense atmosphere. This atmosphere is facilitated by strong art direction and an old-school approach to sound design and music. Sound effects are crunchy, matching the pixelated visual style perfectly. 2D sprites represent the player's FPS rig, as well as directional 2D sprites for the enemies, with a wide array of pixelated textures for the 3D environments that players explore throughout the game.

 <p>
  Achievements (or Trophies on PlayStation platforms) have become commonplace since they first made their debut on the Xbox 360. While many players do not care for achievements/trophies, just as many players go out of their way to get every single achievement or trophy in a game. Obtaining achievements/trophies will vary in difficulty across all games, and in some cases, players will not have to 100% the game to get every achievement.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Alan Wake 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a fairly easy game to get all the achievements/trophies in, especially since there are no achievements associated with difficulty. That said, there are plenty of collectibles that are easy to miss that will result in needing to do another playthrough. There are 66 achievements (or 67 for PlayStation because of the platinum trophy) in total for
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  , and here is how to get them.

  </em>
  With the release of the first DLC for
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  , there are 12 new achievements/trophies for players to unlock. While it won't take a lot of time for players to unlock them all, Night Springs is certainly a DLC that longtime fans of the Alan Wake series will enjoy. When Lake House is released, the achievements/trophies part of that DLC will be added as well.

  's new Prismatic subclass is undoubtedly one of the best features of the latest expansion, The Final Shape. With it, players can wield the powers of both the Light and the Darkness, using a unique combination of abilities from every subclass they've learned up to this point. Similarly to
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  's Warfarer vocation,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Prismatic subclass allows players to build a powerhouse of a Guardian, and these builds can grow even more powerful with the addition of the game's new Exotic class items. However, to unlock the Prismatic subclass, players will first need to play The Final Shape's campaign, which sees them acquiring the subclass fairly early on.

 <p>
  Although players can unlock the new Prismatic subclass not too far into The Final Shape's campaign, they won't unlock every Prismatic Fragment automatically. Instead, they must venture off the beaten path many times throughout the campaign to find the missing Fragments and flesh out their Prismatic build. This is a new form of subclass progression for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , and it's already not a popular one. That being said, there is an undeniable benefit to it, even if the whole system initially seems to be a bit of a pain.

  The Final Shape's Prismatic Progression System Encourages Thorough Exploration
 </h3>
 <p>
  In The Final Shape, the subclass progression system is much different from what it has been before. In Lightfall, the expansion before The Final Shape, players could unlock Fragments for their Strand subclass by earning Strand Meditations and spending them at the Pouka Pond. For
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's normal subclasses — Void, Solar, and Arc — players can visit Ikora Rey in the Tower and unlock those Fragments there. This is a very dependable system, as it simply requires players to obtain the resources necessary for purchasing the Fragments and then spend them on whichever Fragments they wish to unlock. Unlike
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's other subclasses, the Final Shape's Prismatic Fragments require a bit of exploring.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1310} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->

 <p>
  As players progress through The Final Shape's campaign, they will regularly come across opportunities to obtain more Fragments for their Prismatic subclass in special chests. These are often found after challenging encounters and boss fights, but others can only be found by looking in the most unlikely places. One Prismatic Fragment, for instance, is hidden in a crashed plane on the mountain during the Ascent mission in The Final Shape. Hiding the Fragments like this encourages players to explore the Pale Heart a bit more than they might initially think they should, and since the Pale Heart is more than worth exploring, this part of the Prismatic progression system works. Unfortunately, there is a downside.

  It's Possible to Finish The Final Shape's Campaign Without All the Prismatic Fragments
 </h3>
 <p>
  The biggest issue with The Final Shape's Prismatic progression system is that it's possible to make it through the expansion's campaign without all the Fragments for the Prismatic subclass. When players are first granted access to the Prismatic subclass during the campaign, it might feel exciting at first, but it quickly becomes noticeable just how unreliable it is without all of its Fragments unlocked. This makes the fact that it's possible to miss all the Fragments during a playthrough of the campaign a massive letdown, especially since it would mean playing through the campaign again. Furthermore, there is sometimes no indication of where the Fragments can be found, so players have to be extremely thorough, get lucky, or look their locations up online before venturing into the campaign.

 <p>
  While there is certainly a benefit to The Final Shape requiring players to seek out the Fragments for their new Prismatic subclass, it's unfortunate that it's possible to make it to the end of the campaign without obtaining all of them. Perhaps Bungie will eventually alleviate this issue by making each Fragment more readily available, but for now, players may just have to face the music.

  First, you need to enter the objective area, which is marked by a purple circle on the map. So open the map and travel to the objective area. Once you're there,
  <strong>
   use the Super Earth Flag Stratagem
  </strong>
  to set up the flagpole and raise the flag in the enemy territory.

  For those who don’t know, Stratagems are special tools that you can summon during a mission to complete missions and deal with your enemies. The Super Earth Flag Stratagem is a mission-specific tool. To summon it, go to the Stratagem menu, where you will see the Super Earth Flag Stratagem option. Just click on it, and a flagpole will land.

  Once the flag lands, you will be attacked by bugs. Use your best weapons to deal with them. While you do that, a timer will start, and the Super Earth flag will begin to rise. It will take almost two minutes for the flag to go all the way up.

 <p>
  After killing the enemies, wait for the flag to rise. And yes, make sure to stay around the flagpole, as the timer will stop if you move away and won’t start until you are back. While the flag rises, the anthem of Super Earth will play in the background to boost your spirits. After the timer ends, the mission will be completed, and you will get your rewards.

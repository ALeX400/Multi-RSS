  In his latest appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Elon Musk revealed that he is ranked in the top 20 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Diablo 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  's global leaderboard, which was not only very surprising to Rogan, but also to the rest of the world. Musk has been very vocal in the past about how much he enjoys playing and talking about
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , which might explain why he was so eager to tell Joe Rogan the news.

 <p>
  Among the many great improvements that this game has over its predecessors is
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's mythic unique items, which grant players incomparable perks. The game has received critical acclaim and is beloved by many, but few in the fanbase could have ever imagined that Elon Musk, a man who apparently has no free time, would be ranked in the top 20 positions of the global leaderboard.

  In a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, labeled as episode #2223, Elon Musk and Rogan had a conversation about video games and how they can help gauge mental tiredness. At one point, Musk commented that there were only two Americans ranked in the top 20 positions of
  <em>
   Diablo's 4
  </em>
  leaderboard, and that he was one of them. Earlier in October,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  blew up on Steam, with a record of 55,561 active players at one point, which puts into context just how popular the game is and how hard it is to reach the top 20 positions on the global leaderboard.

 <p>
  Elon Musk's revelation of his ranking on the global leaderboard has left many players perplexed and wondering how such a busy man has enough time to not only play the game, but also rank so high. Especially when
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Rawhide and Iron Chunks issues, as well as other technical bugs here and there, sometimes make progression a lot more difficult than it should be. Judging by the comments on social media, players are reportedly even wondering whether there's someone playing on Musk's behalf while he's busy, as all other explanations seem unlikely.

 <p>
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has taken the world by storm since it was first released last year. Over time, various patches, updates, and changes have been made available to players, and many, such as
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's modifications to the Paragon system in Season 6, have been very well received. Whether Elon Musk will ever delve deeper into how he manages to run a multi-billion-dollar empire and also rank among the top 20 global
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players remains to be seen.

  Since it was released, this title has had its fair share of issues. However,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  releasing hotfixes for the Vessel of Hatred expansion and other buggy content proves that Blizzard Entertainment wants to remain at the top of its game and keep delivering players an enjoyable experience for the years to come. There's no telling what the future holds for
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , but with Season 7 coming up, everything looks just a little brighter.

  <strong>
   Strategy
  </strong>
  games are very fun and challenge players when it comes to the different approaches they must take to succeed in their campaigns and vanquish their enemies. Regardless of what a game is about, players will always have a ton of options when it comes to the decisions they can make and what they want their playthrough to feel like.

 <p>
  While there are many strategy titles that have multiple prequels and sequels, as well as spin-offs, others are single installments. These shine for what they are and are often carefully made to make an outstanding first impression that players remember for years after completing them. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best strategy games that are not part of a franchise.

  As this title and the previous entry prove, the deep-space thematic is popular in strategy games, and with good reason, as it often makes for inhospitable environments that require resource management and strategic planning.

  doesn't really have much going on story-wise. In a nutshell, it's just a bunch of settlers trying to establish themselves on a remote planet. However, as simple as that sounds, what this game does, it does well.

  As far as concepts go,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rusted Warfare
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn't really innovating much, as it takes clear inspiration from other similar titles, such as
  <em>
   Supreme Commander
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Total Annihilation
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer
  </em>
  , and more.

 <p>
  That said, it's often unnecessary to break the mold when what's already in place works well. Players will have to build bases, command units and take different strategic approaches to defeat their enemies and proclaim themselves the victor on the battlefield. Those who like long strategy games will deeply enjoy the roughly 40 hours of gameplay this title offers, presenting various opportunities for varied gameplay.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Bad North
   </em>
  </strong>
  is probably the poster boy for strategy games that pit players against impossible odds while challenging them to face and survive them. This title will have players defend their small territories against invading forces after the chieftain of a small group of islands is slain. While not the only strategy game based on the Viking era,
  <em>
   Bad North
  </em>
  offers a unique experience that strategy game lovers will certainly enjoy.

  Similar to what players might have seen on TV shows and horror films,
  <em>
   <strong>
    They Are Billions

  focuses on a version of the world where humanity has been overrun by relentless, bloodthirsty zombies. Players' job will be to rebuild civilization and survive the vicious zombie hordes as they try their best to ensure that what's left of humanity survives.

  This is harder than it sounds, though, as players will not only have to ensure their monopoly is well established, but also that it's valuable and necessary to the market. All in all,

  is great all-around and offers a wonderful experience.

  An observant player has spotted an easy-to-miss historical inaccuracy in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The anachronism in the single-player story campaign sparked discussion of other potential inaccuracies in other parts of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  and throughout the series.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops
  </em>
  franchise has long been the home of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's more inventive storytelling gambits. This is thanks to the "black ops" premise, which heavily emphasizes the idea of secret histories and conspiracy theories behind otherwise well-known historical events and figures. The original game dug deep into cold war-era espionage missions, while other entries embraced branching narratives and choice-based consequences. The latest entry in the series appears to be keeping with the tradition, with the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  campaign praised by celebrities like Ice T and in reviews.

  Praise isn't perfection, though, and one detail-oriented

  player highlighted a funny historical inaccuracy they noticed in the campaign. Reddit user critlvcritlvcritlv shared a screenshot of what they said was a Ford Transit van seen in the campaign with the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  community. The problem was that the vehicle's design appears reminiscent of the 2018 Ford Transit, while the mission itself takes place in 1991, nearly 27 years earlier.

  The screenshot was taken from the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  campaign mission "Blood Feud," which involves the characters Case and Sev investigating a lead in Avalon on the Medditerranean Coast in 1991. Sev meets Case in a large, disguised spy van, and it's this van that appears to be anachronistic. In addition to its resemblance to a much more modern Ford van, the van appears to include high-intensity headlights. Such headlights (also known as xenon headlights) were not common until the late 1990s, and would thus be unlikely to feature on a van intended to look inconspicuous.

  Fellow
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players joked about the admittedly minor anachronism, claiming that
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was now "literally unplayable," and acknowledged that the vast majority of players are unlikely to notice or care. Some theorized that the van model is a stock asset reused from a different modern
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game, like the
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  campaign, which is set in the 2020s. Other players disputed the assertion that the van in the screenshot is a Ford Transit, suggesting instead that it's a Fiat Ducato, though even in that case, the design would still be ahead of its time compared to 1991.

 <p>
  Minor, if noticeable, issues like asset reuse highlight the ongoing debate around the practice in games. Reusing high-quality assets is a valuable cost-saving measure for game developers, but excessive reuse can leave players thinking that a game looks "cheap" or "lazy." Some series get around the issue, like when, like when
  <em>
   Like A Dragon
  </em>
  games reuse assets elegantly, taking advantage of familiar sights to give players a sense of familiarity.

      <title>Every Diablo Expansion, Ranked By How Long They Take To Beat</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Every
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  is an almost endless hole of content even from the base package. The developers do not stop there, though. In addition to updates, each game is also treated to content expansions, adding new chunks of story to the main adventure. These expansions usually come paired with radical changes to the game's systems, often acting as a refresh.

 <p>
  Those purely interested in the campaigns will be more interested in finding out the lenghts of these expansions. None of them rival the length of a base
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  campaign, but they generally offer enough gameplay to justify a purchase even just for one playthrough.

  <em>

  is old enough that players can buy the whole bundle for the price of a single full game or even less.

  <em>
   Hellfire
  </em>
  is a unique expansion in that its content does not affect as much of the main game as the other expansions for future games did. It was also handled by Synergistic Software and not by Blizzard. Multiplayer is not as easily integrated into the adventure as the main story, though LAN is still possible.

  This probably is not as big a concern for modern gamers since
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  is not as active as the newer games or even
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  . Though the shortest of the expansions with an actual campaign,
  <em>
   Hellfire
  </em>
  still adds some elements that affect the main story. There is a new class and also new items. New enemies also show up, but only in the dungeons specifically made for
  <em>
   Hellfire.
  </em>

  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  was a return to the morose atmosphere of the second game. Some fans considered
  <em>
   Diablo 3's
  </em>
  aesthetic a little too bright for their tastes. The expansion continues with the oppressive atmosphere and art that would look right at home on a heavy metal album cover. Few names are more metal than
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , after all.

  The expansion brings with it a relatively meaty campaign and a new landmass to explore that is directly connected to the currently existing open-world environment. Even if players do not purchase it, there is a lot of new content to explore in the update that comes with it, including a whole new class. Those who do buy it are treated to eight and a half hours of gameplay picking up where
  <em>
   Diablo 4's
  </em>
  story left off.

  <em>
   Diablo 3

  had a rocky launch, compounded by the maligned always-online requirement. The
  <em>

  expansion was more of a refresh than the other expansions on this list, massively overhauling almost every system in the game to make
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  a smoother experience.

 <p>
  Loot, difficulty, and leveling were all tweaked, making
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  a more beloved game because of it. The expansion itself is considered a highlight of the whole
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  package. The main game is still a fun time, but
  <em>
   Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  more than lives up to the
  <em>

  </em>
  name.

  As great as the debut is,
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  is when the series became one of the most renowned names in gaming. The game is still beloved to this day and some see its less forgiving sensibilities as a plus over its sequels. While it is not an easy game today on the normal and harder difficulties, it was way harder back before the
  <em>
   Lord of Destruction
  </em>
  expansion came out.

 <p>
  This new content, which came out almost exactly a year after the main game in 2001, brought with it heavy gameplay rebalancing along with new features to make the overall gameplay more interesting. It also added two more classes to the mix for players to use. At more than 19 hours to beat,
  <em>
   Lord of Destruction
  </em>
  is longer than a large handful of full games, making the extra purchase more than worthwhile.

  Leaked images from Blizzard seemingly suggest a remastered version of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warcraft 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is in the works. If the leak proves true,
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Remastered
  </em>
  could be announced at the upcoming Warcraft Direct showcase coming on November 13.

 <p>
  November 15 marks the 30th anniversary of the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  franchise. To celebrate, Blizzard is holding tons of collaboration events across its various games, as well as the inaugural Warcraft Direct presentation on November 13. What’s more, between a new
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  mount bundle and trading post reward,
  <em>
   WC3
  </em>
  -inspired art on the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  Direct key art, and a brief update on the internal PTR catalogue, evidence suggests something big is in store for
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Now, new evidence suggests more exciting news for
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  RTS fans – but this time, it isn’t about
  <em>
   WC3
  </em>
  . Several new promotional images recently appeared on Battle.net under the heading of
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Remastered
  </em>
  Internal Alpha. Discovered by renowned Blizzard dataminer Stiven, these images depict Anduin Lothar sailing on an Alliance vessel against Orcish grunts wearing
  <em>
   Warcraft 2
  </em>
  -style armor, complete with multiple logos that perfectly match modern Blizzard’s style.

  Though part of
  <em>
   Warcraft 2
  </em>
  can be played in
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  thanks to a fan campaign, an official remaster is an exciting prospect. This leak was verified by Marlamin and Chaud, two other credible sources within the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  community, with the alpha publicly visible on BlizzTracker. While this still isn’t technically a confirmation by Blizzard itself, between the quality of the leaked images, the multiple origins of verification, and the alpha build, it seems extremely likely that an announcement for
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Remastered
  </em>
  is imminent.

 <p>
  Judging from the name,
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Remastered
  </em>
  will likely not be a full remake of the original RTS, but rather a version with improved graphics and optimization for modern PCs. Looking at what Blizzard did with
  <em>
   Diablo 2: Resurrected
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   StarCraft: Remastered
  </em>
  , the core of the game will likely be unchanged, though it may include modern accessibility options, convenience, and audio and visual upgrades.

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Remastered
  </em>
  is real, it will almost certainly be announced at
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  Direct, which takes place on November 13. It is possible the potential project could be linked to whatever might be happening with
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  as well, though it remains to be seen if that is the case right now. Either way, fans of the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  franchise are eager to learn if this leak is real – and also apprehensive, considering how much of a disappointment
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  was to many players. Regardless, it seems RTS gamers may have many reasons to tune in to the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  Direct presentation.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Rocket League
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  are two widely different experiences. While most players go to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for its battle royale mode, along with various other modes like Rocket Racing and the popular
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , those looking to play soccer with cars may dive into
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  . As different as these games are, they share a few things in common — one of which is transferable cosmetics.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  features a wide range of cosmetics that can also be acquired in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , allowing players to use their favorite vehicle in both games without additional cost. Transferable vehicles are an excellent addition for players enjoying both games, but how exactly do players

 <p>
  After
  <em>
   Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and its sequel,
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , largely left their stories overshadowed by a massive open world,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been a refreshing change of pace for the franchise. Not only has the latest installment offered an engaging narrative that more recent installments have somewhat lacked, but the titular princess herself, having filled the role of lead protagonist, also proves that characters other than Link can head up a noteworthy
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  story. As such,
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  could be a forerunner of sorts for future installments, opening the door for even more unique characters to take center stage.

 <p>
  While it might seem strange to feature someone other than Link or Zelda in a lead role, it could be a way for
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  to reinvent itself. Nintendo has been fairly consistent about ensuring each
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game is different from the last, but it still might be worth taking some even sharper turns sooner rather than later to keep the series on top of its innovative trends and maintain its momentum moving forward.

  There Are a Couple of Great Non-Link Characters Who Could Lead a Compelling Zelda Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  With Zelda now having proven that Link isn't the only one who can lead the way in a mainline installment, the series could look at putting some of its other major characters at the helm. Impa, for instance, might be considered one of the series' most notable characters worthy of a lead role, due to her persistent recurrence and the intriguing nature of her character. A challenging action-adventure game similar to
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  might be a solid choice for the battle-hardened and stealthy Sheikah, despite her occasional appearance as a non-fighting character.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker

  's Tetra could be the star of her very own pirate adventure prequel, especially considering her backstory and true identity. Prior to the events of
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  , Tetra spent her life on the open seas, leading a pirate crew in search of treasure. However, as the game's story unfolds, it is revealed that Tetra is, in fact, the reincarnation of Zelda. In light of that revelation, a prequel featuring Tetra in her life before
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  could be a compelling story.

 <p>
  While a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game could feature its "good" characters in a lead role, other unconventional characters like Ganondorf and the Skull Kid might offer unique perspectives in a lead role. Featuring Ganondorf in a lead role would certainly make for a dark story, but it could grant players firsthand experience with certain timelines where the villain actually defeats Link. Additionally, a game featuring the Skull Kid, who is most known for his role in
  <em>
   Zelda: Majora's Mask
  </em>
  , could show his life before he was corrupted by Majora's Mask, as well as his slow descent into madness.

  Some Zelda Characters Might Even Offer Intriguing Sim Experiences
 </h3>
 <p>
  Branching away from its normal story-driven format,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  could even venture into sim territory with a couple of its characters — namely, Beedle and Dampe. Beedle has been a recurring character in the series for some time now, occasionally appearing selling various wares like potions, arrows, and other essential items. As such, perhaps a shopkeeping sim where players are in control of Beedle and can travel throughout Hyrule selling items to Link and other Hylians might be in order. Additionally, Dampe has frequently played the role of gravekeeper, suggesting a sim akin to Lazy Bear Games'
  <em>
   Graveyard Keeper
  </em>
  might be a good fit for the world of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  There are clearly plenty of characters in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  universe who would produce unique stories if they were featured in a lead role, like Impa, Tetra, Ganondorf, and the Skull Kid. Furthermore, characters like Beedle and Dampe could see
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  branching out into the sim genre for a fresh departure from the series' traditional gameplay. Hopefully,
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has started something here that Nintendo will continue by putting more non-Link characters in the spotlight.

  Ahead of an official reveal, reputable leakers have claimed that the beloved
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  OG mode will return permanently this December. If the leak is true, every Chapter 1 season will return to
  <em>
   Fortnite

  on a monthly basis alongside all-new content.

  Chapter 2 Remix went live on November 2, marking the return of the Chapter 2 map. Every week, certain areas on the Chapter 2 map are themed after famous rap artists, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD. Players may also level up the new Remix Pass by earning XP in all
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  modes, thanks to various updates to the battle pass progression system. In the months leading up to Chapter 2 Remix's launch, many fans anticipated the return of
  <em>

  </em>
  OG, which proved to be a highly successful mode when it was introduced in 2023.

  According to leakers HYPEX and ShiinaBR, the popular
  <em>

  OG mode will be a permanent addition to the popular battle royale game this December. All 10 seasons of Chapter 1 will supposedly return on a monthly basis, so Seasons 1 through 10 will run consecutively from December 2024 to September 2025 if the leak is accurate. Moreover, only OG loot will be available in the returning mode, and this loot pool will be present in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG's Build and Zero Build variants.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is also expected to receive a slew of new content as the OG mode rotates through its seasonal content each month, but further details were not revealed.

  A reveal trailer for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG's return could be released as soon as the upcoming
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Chapter 2 Remix Finale event on November 30, according to the anonymous source that reached out to the leakers. However, both HYPEX and ShiinaBR note that the announcement could also happen at The Game Awards 2024 show on December 12, with millions of gamers watching around the world. At least eight other
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  modes are currently in development, so more reveals are expected in the near future.

  Once Chapter 2 Remix ends,
  <em>

  is expected to undergo some changes this December as well. Once December 1 rolls around, all future Music and LEGO Passes in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  will have one track featuring free and premium rewards. Players may claim rewards on the unlocked pages of each active pass in a non-sequential order on all passes. An auto-claim feature will be available, allowing players to automatically receive their free and premium rewards once they're unlocked. According to Epic Games,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players will also have "an easy way" to purchase all premium passes at once or buy pass rewards individually.

  features an abundance of playable characters over their games that can be crafted into the ultimate potential for being overpowered and fun. Since
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  boasts of being the original looter shooter, it’s no surprise that a world as expansive and chaotic as Pandora would need a slice of fun in order to progress through it, and luckily, the playable characters serve that role well.

   </strong>
   As players prepare for the excitement that awaits within the secrecy of Borderlands 4, it might be time to head back to Pandora for one last thrill ride before the next adventure and experience the lives of some of the most fun characters. Whether it's a fun time punching anything that moves or an experimental style with different skills to make for a true bezerking gunslinger that fights off the rest, the best Borderlands characters to play as certainly offer an immense degree of fun that's hard to replicate anywhere else.

 <p>
  Moze is one of the best choices for Borderlands 3, especially for solo players who want a little extra firepower to grace their mayhem. Moze has one of the most fun action skills out there, with Iron Bear, which shows her summoning a giant mech suit that can unleash devastation upon the warzone, with or without Moze inside the suit.

 <p>
  Being able to control a giant mech suit feels extremely powerful, especially with the right skill trees invested in that will further bolster the firepower and health of the mech suit. Those who play as Moze will certainly stand out against their Vault Hunter allies.

  Nisha is a law-bringer who can be absurdly fun in the right hands. Anyone who enjoys a good Western will enjoy putting on Nisha's holster, and that's especially true when it comes to her Showdown ability. Increasing the fire rate, reload speed, damage, and accuracy of her weapon, Nisha basically gets a critical hit aimbot for a couple of seconds to really lay down the law.

 <p>
  Nisha's power can definitely be abused with some of the best gameplay in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and paired with Showdown, players are going to absolutely destroy every minor enemy in sight. Each fight is in Nisha's favor thanks to her quick draw, and who wouldn't want to run around with dual pistols?

  Zane is easily one of the more fun Vault Hunter picks for
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  thanks to his witty and rude dialogue and his backstory as a Flynt brother. Yet, there’s more to Zane than just that, as he’s a character that can have two active abilities at once, allowing further versatility of use and play in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . Whilst his latter ability might sacrifice his grenade, it can definitely make it worth it to be a gadget-throwing operator.

 <p>
  Zane has a plethora of abilities to choose from, like a digital clone, an automated drone, a barrier shield, and a shoulder cannon. Each of Zane’s gadgets has their own use for situational use, and his flexibility with weapons and gear allows players to enjoy fast-paced mayhem.

 <p>
  One of the vanilla and exciting options for
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  is most certainly Salvador, a man who proves that size matters not, especially when this particular specimen is extremely violent and vulgar. Salvador is a hilarious character who shoots first and asks questions later, but playing as him is even better thanks to his rapidly recharging ability to dual-wield any weapon in the character’s inventory.

 <p>
  Salvador can dual-wield two of the best rocket launchers to great success, allowing him to annihilate the toughest of enemies across Pandora. With weapons that refresh ammo and reload rapidly, the Gunzerker is a solid choice for players who only care about shooting guns and healing back with no consequence.

  As a playable character in
  <em>

  via DLC, Gaige presents an entirely new skill set that can benefit all, but especially those players in solo. Gaige’s ability summons D

  74-TP, her Deathtrap that is more than capable of handling some tough enemies, and even reviving players that go down. Deathtrap is the perfect companion, bringing forth co-op to those who are not playing in co-op.

 <p>
  Gaige is a lot of fun, and Deathtrap definitely makes her an iconic pick. The character has a death machine on the field for an entire minute and paired with the right skills, players are able to create some truly powerful builds that will have them become immortal conductors of death, complete with visual upgrades to Deathtrap the further they progress it.

  Claptrap might annoy some players, not just for the randomness of his abilities, but for the dialogue that spouts from his audio chamber. Claptrap is funny, and a lot of fun to play as, and for players seeking a roll of the dice in
  <em>
   Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel
  </em>
  , they should definitely check him out – especially when it can offer a variety of unique styles due to how Claptrap works compared to other playable characters.

 <p>
  Claptrap’s skill set is somewhat random, and his super ability can provide him with unconventional and familiar abilities that permit him to devastate the field. However, there are some drawbacks to Claptrap that make him a high-risk and high reward, as players might find the randomness not in their favor. Either way, it certainly aids the way Claptrap plays.

  Krieg becomes the first playable Psycho character in
  <em>

  , and as the DLC character to
  <em>
   Borderlands 2

  , he is definitely something players who want a good time do not want to skip. Krieg is all about melee combat, and he greatly benefits from getting injured in the fight, as the right perks will increase his damage and resistance to damage.

 <p>
  Krieg is a lot of fun to play as thanks to his speed and weight. Krieg is a heavy character who cannot be pushed around, and his special ability allows him to wield his axe, throwing it and slashing everyone in his path to gain all of his health back. With the right skills, players can become a mutated version of Krieg, growing in size, health, and strength to bring mayhem to Pandora.

  The original
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  featured Brick as the Berserker class, a character who prominently focused on explosives and melee. Brick made for a great choice for those who wanted to embrace the chaos of Pandora, as they could greatly benefit from overwhelming enemies by punching them to death and healing rapidly, showcasing a character that would never back down from the danger and mayhem that awaits.

 <p>
  Brick’s skills and abilities focused on his rage state, which improved melee strength and his health pool, allowing him to be nearly invincible when facing off against enemies. Brick is definitely a viable pick for the potential of fun and ease of access when it comes to creating builds for him.

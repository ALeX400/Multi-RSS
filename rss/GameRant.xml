 <p>
  Following the Dragonite Tera Raids,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  revealed that the next Seven-star Tera Raid boss will be the fiery Starter called Incineroar. The upcoming battle in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  will be the first new Tera Raid battle to feature a Starter in over two months when Sceptile the Unrivaled was previously featured.

 <p>
  Known as the Heel Pokemon, Incineroar first debuted in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun and Moon
  </em>
  . As the final evolution of Litten and Torracat, Incineroar is a Fire and Dark dual-type beast based on professional wrestlers who play the "heel" or "bad guy" role in the squared circle. Although Incineroar is motivated by the crowd's reaction and strongly prefers facing challenging opponents, it is also shown to have a soft spot for its younger fans and will go out of its way to lend a hand. In
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , Incineroar can be obtained by catching a Litten in The Terarium's Canyon Biome and evolving it through leveling.

 <p>
  With the Dragonite Seven-Star Tera Raids coming to a close,
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  players will soon have another challenge to take down. According to Serebii.net, the Seven-Star Tera Raid battle against Incineroar the Unrivaled will start on Thursday, September 5, at 8:00 PM Eastern, and end on Sunday, September 8, at 7:59 PM Eastern. A rematch will take place the following week, from September 12 through 15, which will give players another chance to take down the Heel Pokemon. Similar to Primarina, Incineroar the Unrivaled will have one of its natural types as its Tera Type. In this case, it will be a Tera-Dark type and will grant the Mightiest Mark to Pokemon that can defeat it.

 <p>
  Following a pattern established by other Starter Pokemon raid bosses, Incineroar the Unrivaled will likely have its Hidden Ability Intimidate available at the start. This will lower the physical attack power of its foes by one stage to begin the bout and is one reason why Incineroar is a constant threat in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  's VGC-ranked battles. As for potential moves, the Heel Pokemon can use powerful physical attacks like Darkest Lariat, Flare Blitz, Earthquake, and Close Combat to overwhelm its foes. As a Dark-type Pokemon, Incineroar the Unrivaled is immune to Psychic damage but also vulnerable to Fairy and Fighting attacks.

      <title>The Best Games On Xbox Game Pass (September 2024)</title>

  Microsoft’s Game Pass service is easily worth the price of admission. Many might balk at the concept of having their video game library locked behind a subscription service, but the fact is subscribers get access to an incredible selection of titles spanning from indie darlings to triple-A blockbusters for a surprisingly affordable monthly fee.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":354} -->

 <p>
  With such a dizzying array of fantastic titles on display, it can be a daunting task deciding which ones are worth a player’s time. Given that the cost of entry is taken care of with the subscription fee, the most pressing matter is determining the best use of your hard drive space. Thankfully, the diamonds of this collection are readily apparent. Here’s a look at the greatest games that Xbox Game Pass has to offer.

  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  looks like a pretty direct
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  -like (we’ll call this a subgenre, why not?) at first blush — the stylistic presentation, the UI, it’s all pretty familiar. And while that can be sort-of an apt description for starters, it definitely does the entirety of the game a disservice.

 <p>
  Things start simply enough. The game casts you as an explorer that got a bit too curious with a discovered relic and then — presto — you’re deposited into a deep, dark cave and expected to craft your way to a sustainable subterranean lifestyle (alongside up to eight of your friends, if you please).

  Where
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  has the cozy social sim elements polished to perfection,
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  veers solidly into survival-crafting territory. There’s a pretty well-developed RPG-lite system at play alongside significant base-building elements more akin to
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  — you’ll be fighting big bad bosses more often than you’ll be dating the locals, but if you’re up for a grindier experience, then
  <em>
   Core Keeper’s
  </em>
  going to be the ticket to satisfy your crafty retro kick.

  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  is a masterpiece of cinema. It captured the nuance and customs of one Italian-American crime family, and sparked an interest in the mafioso lifestyle it portrayed. I wouldn’t have thought it possible for a video game to capture that same mesmerizing dynamic, full of vendettas, personal codes, and contracted hits, but the original
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  game did a damn fine job. However, you can’t be expected to play a 2002-era game in this day and age.

 <p>
  Which is why
  <em>
   Mafia: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  is a godsend now available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You play as Tommy Angelo, a former cab driver who finds himself joining and rising in the ranks of the Salieri crime family. Tommy, and you as the player, prove your loyalty through various acts of service to the main mafia boss, Ennio Salieri. But, as you may expect, things start to unravel once loyalties are questioned and people try to extricate themselves from the crime-family life.

 <p>
  I know this all sounds like heavy stuff, but it’s an enjoyable as well as an engrossing time. The narrative is the key strength of the game, so if you’re looking for a story-driven title to occupy your time and scratch that Godfather itch you’ve now remembered you have,
  <em>
   Mafia: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  is the perfect cure.

  With Microsoft’s acquisition of companies like Activision and Blizzard, we’re just beginning to see popular titles from these publishers make their way to Xbox Game Pass. And while getting
  <em>
   Modern Warfare III
  </em>
  on the service has been all well and good, nothing oozes such volatile levels of excitement the way
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  does. So thanks to the addition of the
  <em>
   N. Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  to Game Pass’ library, that excitement is ready to hop, spin, and dash its way into our hearts.

  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  is a competitive tactical shooter with heavy hero shooter elements — there are quite a few different game modes, but it typically boils down to a 5-on-5 with teams alternating attack and defense. It’s a familiar format for any
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  veteran, but the focus on high-octane mobility and character abilities will definitely take some getting used to.

 <p>
  That said, the game hosts a rabidly competitive playerbase. In addition to conventional “Competitive Matchmaking,”
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  features a “Premier” queue and game mode specifically for players that are looking to go pro — so if you’re looking for an esports grind to get good at, this is the title to fill that void for you.

  <em>
   The Case of the Golden Idol
  </em>
  is an exceedingly clever murder mystery game that stages a series of horrible events players need to unspool bit-by-bit. The premise is simple: players are presented with an image of some ghastly event and a block of text where crucial information is missing that they need to fill in.

 <p>
  By poking and prodding at the image like a good detective, players start to uncover the names of people and places, as well as potential murder weapons and actions, that explain everything that transpired the day or night of the incident. It’s clever, satisfying, and its twisted world and events are so inventive, it’s impossible to put down.

  If you’re someone who is tired of FPS games frequently leaning toward the photorealistic and wish there were more that embraced a striking visual art style but still played phenomenally, have you met my friend
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  ?
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  is a must-play FPS game if you’re at all a fan of the genre. We know that’s a phrase that’s used a lot (we’ve probably used it ubiquitously in several entries here), but the flash and polish of
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  makes it more than worthy to be labeled as such.

 <p>
  In a dizzying blend of
  <em>
   Mirror’s Edge
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  pirouettes its way into the genre as a platforming shooter that has you racing as the main protagonist across levels, exterminating heaven-invading demons as you go. For each run, you must shoot all enemies as quickly as possible using the abilities at your disposal, and what follows is a dance of gunplay and traversal that makes you feel like a veritable badass.

  The story (a former denizen of Hell trying to earn a spot in Heaven) is fun, and getting to hear Steve Blum’s dulcet tones is always a plus. But the cream of the crop is the gameplay, which, as we said earlier, is a must-play phenomenon.

  Though it originally surfaced as a launch title for the Xbox One some ten years ago, this fairly straightforward third-person brawler wears its age fairly admirably — though that isn’t to say that it doesn’t wear it at all. It’s definitely an Xbox One game, but it’s a solid one.

  <em>
   Ryse: Son of Rome
  </em>
  slips you into the hobnailed sandals of Roman general Marius Titus, and… well, without spoiling too much, proceeds to unspool a plot more than vaguely reminiscent of the Y2K film
  <em>
   Gladiator
  </em>
  . In terms of story, it does the job, but it’s far from the game’s selling point — the meaty, visceral, highly stylized combat.

  On the tin, it’s a simple enough affair of timed prompts and quick-time events. It never gets too complex, but will certainly offer a challenge and manages to provide some depth with a series of unlockable “perks” that provide different bonuses upon defeating enemies.

 <p>
  The real kicker, however, is the sheer amount of visual flair that it manages to pack in and the fluidity with which it implements its systems into the visual effects. If you missed this one upon the Xbox One’s 2013 launch, it’s well worth the seven or eight hour spin to beat.

  It’s not often that a game comes close to matching the arena brawl perfection that is
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  ; that title has long been the bar that similar games strive to reach. Quite honestly, the first
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  was an absolute failure and didn’t come within miles of that standard. However, with this second entry, the unbelievable has occurred: we’ve gotten a brawler that feels unique, has fantastic, nostalgia-driven fighters, and comes leagues closer to that
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  mark.

  There is twice the polish here than there was before, and the inclusion of Slime-fueled ultimate attacks lends the game an extra bit of identity. And being frank once again, it’s just freakin’ cool to be Squidward slapping the heck out of Jimmy Neutron. We grew up on these cartoons, so getting the chance to play as them with such a silly fun concept is a blast. Plus, there aren’t many fighting games available on Xbox Game Pass, so this makes for a great addition to the library.

  The walking-simulator style of horror games we’ve gotten in recent years have been superb. And one of the most exemplary titles of this genre is
  <em>
   Still Wakes the Deep
  </em>
  . This game places you in one of the most unique settings we’ve been to in a video game, and a ripe one for scare potential. You play as Caz, an electrician aboard the Beira, an oil rig way out in the North Sea. Everyone working on the rig is pretty much isolated from the rest of the world save for some shoddy radio equipment, aged lifeboats, and one lone chopper.
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  This isolation, as you could probably guess, comes into play when the workers drill into something they should not have drilled into. As Caz, you have to navigate the crumbling rig and bypass these otherworldly horrors that begin enmeshing themselves within the infrastructure of the rig and your human coworkers. The performances in
  <em>
   Still Wakes the Deep
  </em>
  are absolutely phenomenal. No fake screaming here. As the people begin undergoing grotesque transformations, their howls, moans, and shrieks all feel terrifyingly legitimate.

 <p>
  And while the minimal gameplay is not going to win any awards, it’s an enjoyable, albeit spine-tingling walk through what it would feel like if a Cthulhu-inspired infection/monstrosity broke out in your place of work.

  Work yourself to death. Or, well, a little ways past it. That’s the gist of
  <em>
   Have A Nice Death
  </em>
  . This slick little roguelike puts you into the tattered robes of an adorably stylized Grim Reaper — or Death — and tasks you with getting the whole business of the afterlife back on track. And it is very much a business, these days. Things have gone a bit wonky with Death Inc. and you, as the CEO, have a moral obligation to fix it with some… relatively aggressive micromanagement.

 <p>
  Which, naturally, entails taking up your scythe, spells, and a host of other potent tools and hacking, blasting, and platforming your way through disgruntled minions to get to the bottom of Death Inc’s management woes. The action’s pretty fast-paced — you’ll need to coordinate your dashing, jumping, and various attacks pretty effectively to make meaningful progress, but it’s pretty easy to get the hang of once you’re into the swing of things.

  Most of the game’s trappings aren’t reinventing the wheel. You have limited (but replenishable) heals a la
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , you’ll map your powers and equipment to a precious few limited slots, and spend currency on upgrades between deaths or at the occasional shop along the way. But where
  <em>
   Have A Nice Death
  </em>
  shines is in the tight gameplay elements, cutesy aesthetics, and naturally, the humor born of a corporatized afterlife. It’s bound to be particularly appealing if you loved Team Cherry’s
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , so give it a swing.

  Many were disappointed with
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  when it first launched as they were expecting a direct analog to
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  given that developer Striking Distance Studios’ Glen Schofield, one of the original co-creators of Isaac Clarke’s first adventure aboard the Ishimura, was behind the game. However, when you begin your first forays with
  <em>
   Callisto
  </em>
  , it’s clear that while some inspiration for the setting and monsters are apparent, the gameplay and principle behind combat is wildly different.
 </p>

 <p>
  You play as Jacob Lee, a man wrongfully imprisoned on the moon of Callisto at the worst possible time. An outbreak of something is turning the inmates into monsters, and you play as Jacob as he struggles to make his way out of Black Iron Prison. An intriguing premise, and when you first get control of Jacob’s movements, there’s this feeling that it’ll be just like walking in Isaac Clarke’s shoes once again. However, combat is a more measured affair, relying on timed swings with your melee weapon, dodging swipes from hideous monsters, and conserving ammo for when you encounter larger monstrosities. The fighting is more restrained, and the journey itself is far more linear.

 <p>
  Despite these differences,
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  is a more enjoyable horror romp than people give it credit for. The tension as you trudge through dilapidated prison corridors is vivid, and the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking despite the horrific surroundings. Both its linear nature and inclusion on Xbox Game Pass’ library lend added weight to the game’s approachable nature. So if you’re looking for another horror offering,
  <em>
   Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  is the perfect game for you.

  You might take one look at
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler’s
  </em>
  cover art, skim over a few screenshots, and assume that it’s nostalgia bait — a plainly-written love letter to JRPG enthusiasts stricken with the notion that it never got better than ATB battles rendered in 16-bit graphics. And really, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But you’d be doing yourself a significant disservice if you assumed that was the entirety of what this game is putting on the table.

 <p>
  Octopath Traveler wears its nostalgia trap on its pixellated sleeves, that’s true. But it wraps that core in several layers of modernized goodness that truly make it pop. Firstly, the entirety of the game is rendered in an initially disorienting (and eventually charming) 2D/3D design direction, with 2D sprites for characters interacting in 3D environments. It also sprinkles in a few decidedly “modern” graphical effects — just-modern-enough to give its mid-90’s aesthetic a modern sheen.

  Upon getting started, the game immediately confronts you with eight overlapping character stories to choose from (each character resembling a different JRPG class trope, naturally), each with its own arc and satisfying conclusion. That said, having eight distinct character arcs to work through can be a bit time-intensive — but hey, those of us used to four-disc PS1 epics shouldn’t really find that to be an issue.

  Xbox Game Pass has been really on top of adding fantastic games to its collection these past few weeks (and for you reading, we mean at the time of writing this updated entry). So many titles have been added, it’s been tough playing them all in a timely fashion to keep up with including the best ones here. Which is why we’re a bit late to add
  <em>
   Another Crab’s Treasure
  </em>
  to our list.

  You play as a small hermit crab who gets their shell “repossessed” by a Loan Shark (a talking shark head; it’s hilarious) on behalf of the Duchess of Slacktide. And thus begins your journey to reclaim your shell, find out what is going on in this deteriorating ocean land, and battle a heck ton of bosses.

  To put it simply,
  <em>
   Another Crab’s Treasure
  </em>
  is a Soulslike with a cute visual style and a whopping amount of humor. When we first picked it up, we were not expecting it to be as charming as it was. But the heart of the game and its fairly deep yet still approachable mechanics make it a fantastic Soulslike game to try.

  Before even thinking about installing
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  , you should know exactly what kind of game you’re getting into.
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  is a glacially-paced, narrative-driven title that, on the surface, doesn’t say much. You’re following along the amiable yet bland Harold aboard the Fedora, an underwater ship that has been marooned on a watery planet for years.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":24,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":24,"nbrPlacementsScanned":24,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":369} -->
 <p>
  This station is full of quirky characters you can talk to and assist throughout the game’s runtime. And while there are a handful of fascinating gameplay moments sprinkled throughout, you’re largely just side-scroll-ambling down corridors to start mild conversations with these people.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":24,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":24,"nbrPlacementsScanned":24,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":668} -->
 <p>
  This all may sound like harsh critiques against the game, but
  <em>
   Harold Halibut’s
  </em>
  status as a hidden gem is enshrined between two pillars: its unique visual style and the unrelenting adherence to the themes it's going for. The handmade, stop-motion techniques on display are both delightful and impressive. There is no other game that looks like
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Similarly, there is no other game that is about what
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  is about. (I’m not going to spoil the plot.) So while there is a possibility you will play through the game and find it resoundingly boring, there is also a chance that the themes it’s trying to convey will just solidly land for you. And if they do land, they will land hard.

  Have you ever wanted to know what Josef Fares was up to before he worked on
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  ? Prior to those amazing, cooperative-driven titles, Fares worked on a small but ambitious single-player puzzle game called
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  . And to our delight, it’s been added to the Xbox Game Pass library. Even though this game is meant to be played by one person, you can feel the seeds of “cooperation DNA” in its bones.

 <p>
  Each brother is controlled by one half of a controller, with one toggle moving the oldest and the other moving the youngest. At first, it’ll make your brain go cross-eyed as you acquaint yourself with this disjointed style of control, but as you stick with the boys’ journey to save their father, climbing mountains, causing diversions, and dodging enemies, it feels more natural.

 <p>
  As with many of Fares’ games,
  <em>
   Brothers
  </em>
  doesn’t overstay its welcome, with each section of the adventure lasting as long as it needs to before moving on to the next thing. And by the time the conclusion rolls around, you’ll find that this may be one of Fares’ most emotionally satisfying narratives yet.

  The
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  series has a whole host of fantastic games in its history, from the iconic title that started it all to the much-beloved
  <em>
   Tomb Raider: Legend
  </em>
  . And though we often see reboots that don’t do the original justice in the video game world, thankfully, Crystal Dynamics did not let us down with the beginning of its Survivor trilogy.

  In this outing, Lara Croft isn’t the seasoned raider of tombs we’ve known for years, but rather an inexperienced explorer thrust into an incredibly dangerous adventure that will have her clinging to life (and a lot of cliff sides) more often than not. This rebooted
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  has you guiding Lara through some of the most harrowing situations you will ever see in a game. Not only does she have to unravel a perilous mystery at the heart of a lost island’s cult, she has to deal with armed thugs and terrifyingly sharp river debris.

 <p>
  I kid you not, if you thought Lara Croft was a light-hearted adventure with a bit of “archaeology” thrown in, this Survivor reboot will catch you unprepared. Near the very beginning of the game, Lara needs to crawl through a literal tunnel of blood after she and her team crash-land on the island. It’s gritty, but fun, action-packed with a light sprinkling of puzzles, and a joy to run a completionist playthrough on. And while it might feel wildly different from classic
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , as you play it, you can feel the love and respect it has for what came before.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe, despite how oversaturated it may become with films, TV series, and games, is one that’s always ripe for new stories. One of the standout
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  narratives of the past decade was
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,
  </em>
  Respawn Entertainment’s adventure game that follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan who escaped the massacre of Order 66. That was a fantastic game in its own right, but its sequel,
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  , doubles down on those narrative chops.

 <p>
  The gameplay largely remains the same, with a Souls-lite style of lightsaber combat, platform puzzling, and open-world-ish exploration. But the story is seriously where
  <em>
   Survivor
  </em>
  shines. It’s not the typical galaxy-ending conflict that we’ve seen in this franchise before, but it’s got high emotional stakes that will keep any fan of the first game gripping their controller long into the night.

 <p>
  Cal has to confront some ideological differences between himself and others who, while still fighting against the Empire, aren’t exactly aligning with what he views to be the right course. And, as the story proves, surviving and keeping ideologies intact don’t always go hand in hand.

  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is probably the single most divisive point of contention for a lot of dedicated fans of the franchise — and deservedly so. At launch, the game’s many shortcomings, bugs, and awkwardly executed design choices were derided pretty heavily. With that said, it did establish one significant pillar for Bethesda to build upon: it created what was, for most intents and purposes, a multiplayer Fallout experience.

 <p>
  In the years since its unceremonious 2018 launch, the developers have had a lot of time to reflect, adapt, and course-correct — and all that tinkering has manifested in one of those from-the-ashes stories so rarely witnessed in today’s terminally online gaming ecosystem. In its current state,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is a pretty decent game, and a perfectly reasonable answer to the question, “What if
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  were kind-of an MMO?”

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Now that we’ve spent entirely too much time on the preamble, the premise of the game is essentially summarized in the preceding paragraph. If you’ve played
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , then a lot of
  <em>
   Fallout 76’s
  </em>
  bones will be familiar to you. Largely taking place in the Appalachian region of West Virginia,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  sees your custom-made character emerge from the depths of Fallout 76 on “Reclamation Day” alongside your fellow Vault Dwellers and try to bring some semblance of civilization to the surface world while surviving its nuclear-ravaged wilderness.

 <p>
  It’s a solid translation of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  formula into a multiplayer format, complete with quests, NPCs, a number of factions both familiar and foreign, and that signature wasteland weirdness that makes the setting so special to begin with.

  Underworld is an early main quest in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  that requires players to steal a file from Gorak, the head of the Pyke crime syndicate. While the quest itself seems straightforward, one objective—
  <strong>
   Infiltrate Gorak’s Base
  </strong>
  —can trip up many players. The challenge? You must remain undetected throughout, which can be tricky given the base’s heavy Pyke soldier presence (and
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  <em>
   ’
  </em>
  not-so-convenient stealth mechanics).

  <strong>
   Avoid the guards by moving behind the boxes

      The Black Ops 6 beta includes new maps, weapons, and the Omnimovement system - though one of its maps has some players scratching their heads.

  A player recently noticed a rather unusual error in one of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  's new maps and shared their findings with the rest of the game's online community. The discovery revolves around a prop on one of the multiplayer maps and was made during the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  beta, which allows fans to get their hands on the exciting new FPS weeks ahead of the game's release later this fall.

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is one of the year's most anticipated releases and shakes up the decades-old
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  formula in a variety of ways. Players got their first taste of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's new omnidirectional movement system during the game's beta, which began at the end of August. This beta has also allowed players to explore some of the game's new weapons and maps, though there's still plenty in store for when
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  officially releases later this year. As players wage war on
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's new maps, new strategies and discoveries are coming about at a rapid pace, though one map in particular has caught the community's attention in an unexpected way.

  Reddit user Someweirdspookboi shared an image of Skyline, one of several new maps to be featured in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . This map places gamers in a luxurious resort getaway, though the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  community is particularly interested in Treyarch's choice of musical instruments. Inside the lounge area on Skyline, players will find a piano with 111 keys. While this number may not mean anything to some players, standard pianos have 88 keys, making this video game representation inaccurate. The same Reddit user joked about this inaccuracy, calling
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  "unplayable" because of it.

  Skyline is one of several maps featured in the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  beta, with a few more set to debut as the event continues this September. The
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  beta opened to those who pre-ordered the game on August 30, with this early access window ending on September 4. The beta will open to all players on September 6, with it officially coming to a close on September 9. The
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  beta only includes access to multiplayer, with the game's Zombies and campaign modes still being kept somewhat secret.

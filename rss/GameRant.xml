  <strong>
   Marvel Games
  </strong>
  has had a pretty great run over the last few years. The
  <em>
   LEGO Marvel Superheroes
  </em>
  games were great family-friendly adventures, the Insomniac
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  series has continued to elevate the superhero video game genre,
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  had some great writing, and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is already a major success, amassing over 20 million players within its first few weeks.

  Things aren't going quite as well for DC, however.
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  is the one shining jewel amid a sea of disappointments for DC, with
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  delivering a disastrous one-two-punch for the brand's sales targets. It seems safe to say that 2025 is probably going to be a very different year for Marvel and DC Games.

 <p>
  Marvel's latest success story,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is a 6v6 hero shooter that's taken the gaming world by storm. Following the live-service model set out in games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has only just begun its journey, with its next season beginning in January 2025. Though no details of the next season's content have been confirmed just yet, developer NetEase has stated that new characters, new maps, and new modes will be coming to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  in future updates.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  will likely continue to receive new content throughout 2025. Its current season, Season 0, is said to be around half the length of a proper season. This means that fans can expect
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  Season 1 to last around 2–3 months, meaning they can expect around 4–5 seasons of content in 2025.

  In October 2021, Skydance New Media announced a brand-new project in collaboration with Marvel games. In September 2022, this Marvel project received its first trailer, seemingly confirming a World War 2 setting and that Black Panther and Captain America would be the game's central protagonists. In March of this year, the project was given an impressive story trailer that made full use of Unreal Engine 5, along with an official title:
  <em>

  <em>

  Back in September 2022, EA Motive announced that it was working on an Iron Man game. In July 2023, EA confirmed another collaboration with Marvel, announcing a Black Panther solo game from brand-new studio, Cliffhanger Games. Little news on either game has come out since their announcements, but it seems likely that fans will get to see a reveal trailer for at least one of these games in 2025, likely EA Motive's Iron Man, as the studio hit a "major internal milestone" back in April.

   Marvel's Spider-Man 2

  ,
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  hasn't received any official update in over three years. While the Insomniac hack in December 2023 resulted in early builds of the game being released and some story details being leaked, Insomniac has made no official statements regarding the game's story, gameplay, or release date. Hopefully, fans will finally get to see at least a new trailer for
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  in 2025.

  A live-service looter-shooter,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League

  was meant to be Rocksteady's triumphant return to the DC universe, but it ended up being one of the year's most infamous disappointments. Despite its consistently low player-count,
  <em>

  </em>
  has continued to receive post-launch content, with new playable characters being added every few months. But
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League

  Season 4 will be its last.

  Another DC game that's been cooking for quite a while now, Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first announced at the 2021 Game Awards, and fans have heard nothing official since. Aside from some concept art leaks and some rumors about the game being live-service that were quickly put to rest, DC and Monolith have been radio silent. Recent reports from Jason Schreier suggest that Monolith's Wonder Woman didn't start proper development until after its announcement, so it's unlikely fans will see anything substantial from it anytime soon.

  The

  cast may include Johnny Ray Gill, an actor who previously worked on both
  <em>
   GTA 5

  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . That's according to Gill himself, who hinted at his involvement in

  Rockstar hasn't yet officially confirmed any voice actors who have been hired for its much-anticipated

  protagonist Lucia.

  Another actor possibly involved in the upcoming game is Johnny Ray Gill, the star of Amazon's crime series
  <em>
   Cross
  </em>
  . The 40-year-old actor seemingly teased his potential involvement in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  during a recent interview with YouTube channel Check It TV. As first picked up by The Game Post, the December 13 interview saw Gill reflect on his "dope" experience working with Rockstar in the past, in addition to hinting at yet another one of his collaborations with the gaming giant being on the horizon. "Stay on the lookout, you know, I can't say anything, but there's another situation happening, you know, in that [GTA] world, that may be coming out in 2025–2026, that I'm really happy about," the actor said around the 19:35 minute mark, all the while winking knowingly toward the camera.

  <em>

  would mark Gill's third acting credit in a Rockstar game, following
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   RDR2

  , where he voiced various pedestrian characters. Prior to that, the Portland-born actor was involved in just one other video game, the 2009 browser MMO

  Apart from Gill and Perez, another actor potentially involved in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is Gregory Connors. Game Rant previously discovered Connors's online resume that claimed that he's working on an unnamed Rockstar game slated for a 2025 release. The CV, which has since been pulled, stated that he was playing a "lead" role in the mysterious project, which is likely referring to
  <em>
   GTA 6

  December 5 marked the first anniversary of the
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  reveal trailer. No new footage from the highly anticipated game has been shared by Rockstar ever since.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is still officially targeting a 2025 launch, with Take-Two Interactive recently narrowing down its release window to next fall. Although Gill's latest interview teased a "2025–2026" project, this shouldn't be interpreted as an indicator that the game has been delayed. While a delay remains possible, it’s unlikely that any actor involved in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  would be privy to changes in its release schedule.

  <em>
   Infinite Script Fighting
  </em>
  is an unusual Battleground game where, instead of using the usual abilities, you will use scripts to fight your opponents. There are very few similar
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences, which makes
  <em>
   Infinite Script Fighting
  </em>
  almost unique in this concept.

 <p>
  In this game, scripts play the role of superpowers, but they are many times stronger and more unpredictable. By redeeming
  <em>
   Infinite Script Fighting
  </em>
  codes, you can get even more scripts and choose the one that suits you best.

  <em>
   Boss Tycoon
  </em>
  offers players to build their business empire. At first, you won’t even have a building, but by investing a lot of Boss Bucks, you can hire dozens of employees. And with the help of
  <em>
   Boss Tycoon
  </em>
  codes, you can significantly speed up your progress.

  <em>
   Boss Tycoon
  </em>
  gameplay is pretty typical for the genre, as you need to earn money and buy various upgrades to make even more money. However, in the initial stages, it is quite difficult to progress quickly. To remedy this, you should use
  <em>
   Boss Tycoon
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":136} -->
 <p>
  Each of these codes is a great source of free rewards, including the main currency of the game. Some of them will even give you up to 5000 Boss Bucks, so you do not want to miss these codes. But as always, they are valid for a limited time, so you should hurry.

  Fortunately, the developers add new codes to
  <em>
   Boss Tycoon
  </em>
  quite often. This usually happens when players reach certain milestones, such as liking the game. And in order not to miss new rewards, you need to redeem
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  codes immediately after their release. Therefore, we recommend players to visit the developers' social media. There, you will find all the news about events, updates, and codes first-hand:

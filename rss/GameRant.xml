      <title>5 Open-World RPGs That Age Better Every Year Thanks To Mod Support</title>

  If there’s one indisputable advantage that PC has over consoles, it’s the flexibility offered by thriving
  <strong>
   modding communities
  </strong>
  . Almost every popular game inevitably attracts enthusiasts who strive to enhance it, improving key areas or altering divisive elements from the original. As a result, players can tailor their experience to their vision, as mods vary widely — from minor additions like extra cosmetics, skins, outfits, or hairstyles to significant changes, such as rebalanced combat systems, graphical enhancements, removed level caps, expanded inventories, new weapons, armor, and much more. Some dedicated fans even create their own quests and entire campaigns for their beloved games, or produce spectacular conversion mods, sharing them with other players just for the fun of it.

 <p>
  Over time, several
  <strong>
   open-world RPGs
  </strong>
  have developed a true cult following for modding, with thousands of mods available to tweak every aspect of the base game. This grants an extended lifespan, allowing the game to improve over the years as more mods are created and released, bringing it closer to modern standards and delaying its obsolescence.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is often the first example that comes to mind, as is the case for most role-playing games by Bethesda, Obsidian, BioWare, and CD Projekt Red. Let’s take a look at some of the most notable
  <strong>
   modern open-world RPGs that aged gracefully thanks to active mod support,
  </strong>
  offering fans some of the widest selections of mods on the market.

 <p>
  We’ve already mentioned
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  as one of the evergreen pillars of the modding scene (along with
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  ), but let’s examine a more recent Bethesda game to see how fans and modding enthusiasts have embraced it.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  proved to be a highly divisive game at launch, seemingly failing to meet the lofty expectations set by its pre-launch hype. With a much grander scope than any previous Bethesda title,
  <em>
   Starfield’s
  </em>
  biggest challenge was its fragmented world of countless planets that often feel repetitive, diminishing the sense of a seamless adventure that the studio previously achieved with a single, expansive map. However, this doesn’t mean
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  lacks potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Starfield's
  </em>
  key selling points was its flexible ship-building and base-construction mechanics, offering even greater depth and versatility than those in vanilla
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . These features were merely a starting point for modders, who continue to expand the original possibilities. This applies to nearly every other aspect of the game as well, including the character creator, weapons and gear systems, new quests and adventures, and more.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  also quickly received a variety of unofficial patches to refine the overall experience, addressing persistent bugs and introducing numerous reshades and custom graphics presets to enhance its visual appeal. Some ambitious mods even offer total conversions, such as transforming the game into a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe, bringing fan-favorite aesthetics and atmosphere to this spacefaring RPG. It’s worth noting that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  features a curated platform called “Creations,” where players can access both official and community-made mods with seamless integration (though some are paid). Despite a less-than-stellar launch, it’s clear that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  continues to improve each year, thanks to both the core team’s efforts (such as the addition of the Rev-8 Rover vehicle) and the dedicated modding community, so the game’s best days are still ahead.

 <p>
  Another example of an initially troubled launch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn’t simply aging well — it continues to evolve, with CD Projekt Red releasing patches and content updates for five years straight. Today’s vanilla
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is vastly superior to its 1.0 version in every aspect, featuring substantial changes such as a complete overhaul of the skill tree, clothing and implants systems, as well as a proper police system. However, official support is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the boundless passion and dedication that modding enthusiasts bring to the world of Night City.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being released five years ago,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  remains one of the most visually stunning open-world games available, thanks to official implementations of cutting-edge technologies like path tracing. Mods take its visual grandeur even further, enhancing the quality of textures, materials, and models, improving or customizing the UI for a more immersive experience, and making NPCs more distinct and lifelike. Characters are the heart and soul of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , so it’s no surprise that countless mods expand the game’s character creator, introducing exciting new possibilities, outfits, and tattoos to help players craft the exact character they want to roleplay. This extends to new additions like weapons, ranging from guns to katanas and everything in between, as well as new driveable vehicles. Moreover, some truly game-changing mods introduce features like flying vehicles, fully dynamic quests and activities, and in-depth survival mechanics, allowing players to virtually live in Night City beyond its main story and side quests.

  Even in its vanilla form,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands tall among open-world RPGs, offering unmatched flexibility in gameplay, tactical and strategic possibilities, and a realistic, historically grounded world. While it may lack the polished flair of typical triple-A titles and feel rough around the edges, it more than compensates with its sheer grandeur and freeform gameplay, allowing players to focus on the aspects they enjoy most. With all that,
  <em>
   Bannerlord
  </em>
  provides a near-perfect foundation for enhancement through mods, which largely target gameplay features and core mechanics, rebalancing or refining them for an even more immersive playing experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  From detailed character creators, enhanced third-person combat, and the ability to roleplay as virtually anyone to more expansive features like reworked diplomacy, realistic smithing, improved large-scale battles with better AI, and more robust reputation and companion systems, there are no limits to what players can alter in
  <em>
   Bannerlord
  </em>
  to keep it fresh. Many mods also enhance the game’s presentation, adding immersive details, dynamic weather conditions, and significant graphical improvements. As with any great open-world RPG, fans can explore total conversion mods that transform
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
  </em>
  into, for example, Tolkien’s Middle-earth (Tales from the Age of Men) or George R.R. Martin’s Westeros (Realm of Thrones), among others. For hardcore fans, numerous mods emphasize the game’s historical roots, prioritizing accuracy and authenticity above all. With all these additions,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
  </em>
  exemplifies a game that refuses to age, instead growing richer in possibilities with each passing year.

  Since its launch in 2022,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  has solidified its place as an open-world RPG that's built to last, maintaining impressively high player counts for years. This enduring popularity, combined with its PvP options, has made the game a favorite for modding. Already brimming with diverse character builds and combat possibilities, even multiple playthroughs won’t be enough to try out everything the game offers. However, dedicated players can extend their
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  experience beyond its vanilla content, as mods breathe new life into adventures across The Lands Between.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most notable mod additions is seamless co-op, which proved so popular that it seemingly inspired the devs to explore similar features in their next big titles. Randomizers are another standout category, making each
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  playthrough feel fresh by shuffling enemy, boss, and reward locations, greatly enhancing the unpredictability of its world. Players can pair randomizers with mods that introduce new weapons, robust movesets, or even port bosses and weapons from FromSoftware’s earlier games into
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  — a concept the developers themselves successfully embraced in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  . Finally, given the game’s somewhat dated visuals (in terms of technology), numerous fan-made projects elevate
  <em>
   Elden Ring’s
  </em>
  visual fidelity on PC, with enhanced textures, models, lighting, and an overall richer atmosphere.

  In 2025,

   <em>

  celebrated its 10th anniversary, yet it remains far from abandoned or forgotten. The devs have re-released the iconic RPG on all modern platforms with official enhancements and additions, making the

  modding scene may not match the scale of
  <em>
   Skyrim

With no limit to the creativity of its fans,

  collector Logan Paul gifted his one-year-old daughter, Esme, a rare Shining Magikarp card for Christmas. Paul posted a video of the exchange on social media, which revealed that the Shining Magikarp card was worth approximately $9,000 based on recent sales on the
  <em>

  market.

 <p>
  Known as the Fish Pokemon, Magikarp first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  . Initially a weak Water-type Pokemon, Magikarp subsequently evolves into Gyarados, giving it a new appearance and vastly improved power. In
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver,
  </em>
  Shiny Pokemon were introduced to the franchise, with Shiny Magikarp receiving a rare, golden-scaled form. The golden-colored Fish Pokemon has since proven popular among
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans, with some creating various projects based around Shiny Magikarp. Shiny Magikarp first appeared in the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  in the Neo Revelations set as Shining Magikarp, a Basic Pokemon with 30 HP. Neo Revelation was first released in English in September 2001, and is the third set in the Neo series based on
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  . Shining Magikarp and Shining Gyarados were considered the "secret rare" cards of the Neo Revelation expansion.

 <p>
  On December 26, Paul shared an Instagram video of a Christmas gift he gave to his daughter Esme, a PSA 10 Graded Shining Magikarp
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  card in a case. Paul said that the Shining Magikarp card was due to Esme choosing Magikarp as her Starter Pokemon, and the video stated that the Shining Magikarp had an estimated market value of around $9,000. According to TCGPlayer, Shining Magikarp cards of various qualities can be purchased as low as $183.64 after shipping. Paul, a notoriously avid collector of rare
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cards like Illustrator Pikachu, had previously stated that
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  products have a high return on investment overall. Paul paid $5.3 million for his prized Illustrator Pikachu card in 2022, and said he plans to auction it off in February 2026. It remains to be seen how much money Paul will make from his Illustrator Pikachu auction, and if it will come close to the $5.3 million figure he initially paid.

  have proven successful. In November 2025, Paul entered a $34,700 bid for a Kabuto card during a charity auction hosted by Kabuto King on eBay. However, Paul was outbid by a Twitter user named cards.fun, who won the Kabuto card with a bid of $51,100. Kabuto King stated that, while Paul didn't win, his bid helped bring attention to the Kabuto card auction.

      <title>Steam Users Have 2 Freebies That They Can Claim Right Now, But Time is Running Out</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  users have just a limited amount of time left to claim two freebies currently available on the platform, and one of them, the twin-stick shooter
  <em>
   Undercroft Warriors
  </em>
  , will only be on offer until the morning of December 31. At any given moment, PC gamers can usually find at least a few games that are being given away for free, whether that be via Steam, the Epic Games Store, GOG, Amazon Prime Gaming, Itch.io, or several other digital storefronts.
 </p>

 <p>
  Taking Steam as an example, in the month of December alone, PC gamers have been able to add about 12 games to their library completely for free. These have included a gamut of genres, from the pixel-art indie horror adventure
  <em>
   Just Ignore Them
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Banana Hell,
  </em>
  a challenging platformer where you’re dressed up as a fruit, to the open-world survival RPG
  <em>
   Wild Terra 2: New Lands
  </em>
  . Most recently, a 100 percent discount for
  <em>
   Caveman World: Mountains of Unga Boonga,
  </em>
  a retro-inspired platformer set in prehistory, was being offered until December 30, 10 AM PST.

  Currently, there are two freebies to claim on Steam, but the first,
  <em>
   Undercroft Warriors,
  </em>
  will no longer be available to claim after 10 AM PST on December 31.
  <em>
   Undercroft Warriors
  </em>
  is a stylistic twin-stick shooter features an attention-grabbing pixelated black, white, and red graphic style while it pits players against the seemingly incessant and ever-increasing forces of hell. There are six heroes to choose from to take on the skeletal foes, and each has a different arsenal of weapons and abilities. The goal is to kill as many enemies as quickly as possible, increase your multiplier, and grab the high score.

 <p>
  Steam users have a bit more leeway to claim the second giveaway,
  <em>
   Train Sim World 6: Spirit of Steam: Liverpool Lime Street – Crewe Route Add-on
  </em>
  , as it doesn’t expire until 10 AM PST on January 5. Even if you don’t own the base game, the DLC can still be claimed, though
  <em>
   Train Sim World 6
  </em>
  will of course be required to play it. Conveniently, both the standard and Thomas &amp; Friends editions of
  <em>
   Train Sim World 6
  </em>
  are also on sale until January 5.
  <em>
   Spirit of Steam: Liverpool Lime Street – Crewe Route Add-on
  </em>
  was released on August 26 and, as its name suggests, it adds the 36-mile Liverpool Lime Street to Crewe route as it existed in 1958. Developer Dovetail Games recreated the stations, tracks, and infrastructure to be historically accurate, giving players a chance to experience what it’s like to carry passengers on an LMS Jubilee Class locomotive during the era of steam trains.

  Many PC gamers also won’t want to miss the latest game being given away for free by Epic Games Store. Since December 18, the digital gaming storefront has been giving away a new title every 24 hours in celebration of the holidays. The fourteenth free title being given away by Epic Games Store is
  <em>
   Trine: Classic Collection
  </em>
  , and it will be available to claim at no cost until December 31 at 8 AM PST. This particular giveaway is particularly enticing because the Classic Collection includes the complete editions of the first four games in the highly rated series of puzzle-platformers. The only title missing from the collection is
  <em>
   Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy,
  </em>
  which happens to be discounted 60 percent until January 8 on both Epic Games Store and Steam.

   <em>
    Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a landmark RPG set within the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  Universe, 4,000 years before the formation of the Empire. In the game, players can create their characters and choose their path. They can go towards the light side or the dark side if they wish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the game, players will meet different characters they can recruit as companions. One such character is Mission Vao. Mission is a young Twi’Lek who is discovered in the Undercity on the planet Taris and has high stats in Dexterity, Stealth, and Demolitions. Vao's rise to fame was meteoric, from living on the streets to being named one of the saviors of the galaxy by the Republic. She started the first part of her life surviving with her brother, who would teach her everything but eventually abandon her. These painful early experiences would not break her, though, as she would form a close bond with the Wookie Zaalbar.

  Ashley Williams is a human companion in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mass Effect
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  series, who becomes a powerful ally for Commander Shepard. Players first meet Ashley on Eden Prime during a large-scale invasion of Geth. Shepard meets her at a particular low point, helping her after her entire unit is killed. Ashley decides to continue to fight with Shepard against Sarin and the Geth. She is a capable soldier and becomes a loyal friend to both Shepard and the crew of the Normandy.
 </p>
 <p>
  She appears in all three
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  games, as a companion in the first and third games, and as a cameo in the second. However, players can also choose to sacrifice her in the first game. The character is a voice of reason for Shepard and also a potential romance.

  Aveline is a powerful warrior who becomes a close ally of Hawk throughout the story. Players will first meet Aveline when she and her husband are fleeing from Darkspawn in Lothering. Hawk will save Aveline, but it will be too late for her husband. She later becomes a member of the city guard, rising to the rank of captain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aveline lives by a strong moral code. She is powerful and confident in battle, yet a little socially awkward in her personal life. She is a likable character in the game, with some of the best humor coming from her side quests. In combat, she is a tank that can deal large amounts of damage.

 <p>
  Although she was emphasized in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2
  </em>
  's marketing, Miranda Lawson largely exists in the shadow of many of Commander Shepard's female crew, particularly Liara and Tali. A Cereberus officer engineered to be perfect, Miranda initially comes across as detached, cold, and by-the-books, like she is there to ensure Shepard sticks to the game plan. However, that facade does not really last long, and she warms up surprisingly quickly once she starts to build a relationship with not only Shepard but also other crew members.
 </p>
 <p>
  While her personal arc is not as powerful as, for example, Jack's, Miranda goes on a well-executed journey that is defined by her search for autonomy, agency, and identity. Her loyalty to Cereberus and her father partially stems from a desire to protect her sister, and she remains true to herself even as she breaks away from their shackles.

  Before Larian Studios took over the
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  franchise and created one of the most critically acclaimed RPGs in recent gaming history, BioWare created the original foundation.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2000 and was once again set in the
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  setting of The Forgotten Realms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Available to recruit in chapter one of
  <em>
   BG1
  </em>
  and chapter two of
  <em>
   BG2
  </em>
  , Viconia Devir is a neutral-evil Cleric who is a perfect anti-hero companion in the game. She is a Drow (or Dark Elf) who has strong magic resistance and high dexterity. She is a skilled warrior who can use several different melee weapons, and she can be a romantic option for certain males. She also appears in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  in the Cloister of Sombre Embrace.

  Flemeth is a powerful NPC character who appears in all three of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games. Within the lore of the setting, she is a long-lived character who has appeared in many ancient legends. She goes by many different names, including the Witch of the Wilds and Asha’bellanar by the Elves.
 </p>
 <p>
  While never being an outright hero, she does give aid to the player, most notably in
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  by
  <em>
  </em>
  rescuing the protagonist at the start of the game. In
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , she is also a minor antagonist to her daughter, Morrigan. On top of that, she is one of the most powerful characters in the series. She is a shapeshifter and can take on the form of large creatures, including dragons.

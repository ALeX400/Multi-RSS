  By default, the Meteora dishes out 52 damage to the torso and 63 to the head without being charged. When fully charged, the Meteora will deliver a one-shot kill regardless of where the shot lands. However, there may be situations where players cannot fully charge the Meteora without taking fire. In these cases,
  <strong>
   firing at the head
  </strong>
  while aiming down sights can be a great alternative. If the Meteora is charged up to around 75%,
  <strong>
   a headshot deals 152 damage
  </strong>
  â€”just enough for a lucky one-shot kill if health-boosting Shard Cards are not in play.

  <strong>
   The Paparazzi shines as an early warning system
  </strong>
  for the defense team, working best when placed within lanes leading up to either the A or B Site in Shard Clash. It is also great for covering key flank routes or positioning near the Converter when attacking to
  <strong>
   reveal potential defusers.
  </strong>
  However, players should be mindful of where they place it, as opponents can destroy it if spotted before it is even put to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  <p>
   Hiding the Paparazzi around corners, behind low-bearing walls, or near doorways can be an excellent way to ensure enemies are revealed before they attempt to remove the device. A good practice is to also
   <strong>
    take note of the Paparazzi's activation range
   </strong>
   , shown by the bubble. Doing so will give players an idea of the trap's coverage in the area it is placed in. If players are unhappy with their trap placement, they can always
   <strong>
    recall it and place it somewhere else.
   </strong>

 <p>
  While players may be tempted to fire their Smokescreen toward enemies primarily to reveal them, its ability to move and pass through obstacles makes it
  <strong>
   an excellent form of cover.
  </strong>
  For instance, when players and their team need to cross a long sightline without taking fire, deploying the Smokescreen can be an effective strategyâ€”essentially
  <strong>
   acting as rolling cover while revealing enemies caught in its range.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The same applies to one-on-one encounters from afar, as players can deploy the Smokescreen to conceal their position and move closer for an advantage. Additionally,
  <strong>
   players can freeze the Smokescreen in place
  </strong>
  by pressing the interact key, allowing it to serve as static cover when necessaryâ€”whether to block vision leading into an objective or key area of interest.

 <p>
  Since most Skills in
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  have a limited number of uses, players may be inclined to save them for key situations rather than equipping them at the start of the round. However, with the Meteora,
  <strong>
   its uses replenish over time
  </strong>
  , meaning thereâ€™s less reason to conserve them. Pair this with the fact that
  <strong>
   the weapon automatically reveals enemies targeted by its scope
  </strong>
  when aiming down sights, and thereâ€™s no reason not to take a shot when given the opportunity. If the kill isnâ€™t secured, players can then chase down the revealed opponent to finish them off before they are given a chance to heal.

  Group has had a major presence in the video game landscape for more than three decades. Even though the company doesn't outright own any game developers, it has licensed the LEGO IP out to dozens of studios over the years. The 150+ LEGO video games that have been released so far span a wide variety of genres, from 3D platformers and action-adventure titles to fast-paced cart racers and even 3D puzzle games. Not every game based on the iconic toy has been a hit, of course, but many of them have played a big role in the childhoods of countless gamers around the world.

  Some of the most famous LEGO video games of all time are based off of pop culture franchises, like
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  . The LEGO Group typically shies away from working with M-rated properties, such as
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   James Bond
  </em>
  , but there are an abundance of family-friendly IPs that have yet to get the chance to collaborate with LEGO. Take
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  , for example. Despite being one of the most renowned characters in pop culture history,
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  hasn't received its own real-life LEGO sets, nor has it gotten a LEGO game of its own. Due to
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  's recent resurgence in gaming, however, now is the perfect time for The LEGO Group to green-light a game based on the franchise.

  Hello Kitty Hasn't Had a Great Track Record in Video Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hello Kitty has starred in numerous video games since the early 1990s. The adorable British feline has also appeared as a guest character in many video games, and has even served as the subject of inspiration for certain limited-edition consoles, such as the Hello Kitty Sega Dreamcast that came out in the late '90s. Sadly, many of the
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  video games have only been released in Japan, and the handful that have made their way to the West aren't that great. Titles like 2005's
  <em>
   Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue
  </em>
  and 1999's
  <em>
   Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy
  </em>
  weren't exactly met with glowing reviews.

 <p>
  Hello Kitty's presence in video games has fortunately started to improve as of late. After going on hiatus for several years, the
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  video game series finally made a major comeback with the 2023 release of
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure
  </em>
  . This game, which was developed by the Colorado-based studio Sunblink, is basically the
  <em>
   Hello Kitty
  </em>
  equivalent to
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  . It is a life simulation video game that takes place on an island inhabited by Sanrio characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure
  </em>
  was originally released as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2023, but it has recently begun making its way over to consoles. In January 2025, the game was ported to Nintendo Switch and Windows PC, and later this year, it's going to come to PlayStation 4 and 5. Reviews fo
  <em>
   r Hello Kitty Island Adventure
  </em>
  on these new platforms have mostly been positive so far, with the game earning an 80/100 Top Critic Average on OpenCritic. Additionally, around the same time that
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventures
  </em>
  came to the Switch, Mojang Studios released the
  <em>
   Hello Kitty and Friends
  </em>
  DLC for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , marking the first time that it and Sanrio had ever collaborated on such a project.

 <p>
  Given how successful
  <em>

  has been, it feels like it would be a missed opportunity for The LEGO Group not to cash in on the mascot's newfound popularity by green-lighting a LEGO
  <em>

  game of some sort. Since the two franchises are extremely popular, a high-quality
  <strong>
   LEGO
  </strong>

  game that's on par with the titles developed by TT Games would probably sell like hot cakes, so long as it gets the marketing campaign it deserves.

  Developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive have announced new content coming to both
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cities: Skylines
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines 2
  </em>
  to celebrate the series' 10th anniversary. From fresh creator packs to new radio stations,
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines
  </em>
  fans have plenty to look forward to throughout the month of March.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released in 2015,
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines
  </em>
  quickly became a smash hit with fans of the city-building genre, with many applauding the title's scale and mod support. The latter remains one of the biggest reasons why the game continues to flourish today, as its sequel was released without support for player-created mods, something Colossal Order's CEO regrets to this day. While developers are still attempting to fix the many issues present with 2023's
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines 2
  </em>
  , the original game is still going strong, with the urban planning title celebrating a major milestone and the development team eager to reward dedicated fans to celebrate.
 </p>
 <p>
  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines
  </em>
  on March 10, 2025, fans can look forward to a host of free content coming to both the original title and sequel throughout the month of March. As detailed on Paradox's official website, the original title will be updated with a special 10th Anniversary patch on March 25, which will include three new parks. Another Anniversary patch will also be added to
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines 2
  </em>
  on March 18, and will be packed with 10 free assets. Both games will also get new radio stations and creator packs, and
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines
  </em>
  will be free to play for everyone from March 18-24. Paradox's subscription service will also be expanding on March 13, allowing subscribers to play its grand strategy games with every piece of DLC for a single monthly cost.

  While many players were eager to get their hands on
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines 2
  </em>
  in October 2023, the game has seen some major issues since its release. Malware made its way into the game in late 2024, with players urged to beef up their security to protect against suspicious files targeting crypto wallets. The Beach Properties DLC, released in April 2024, angered fans, with many in the community frustrated by its high price and lack of content. Paradox even offered refunds for the
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines 2
  </em>
  DLC, promising to continue making improvements and apologizing to players.

  the second game was released for PC, players are still waiting for it to appear on consoles. Earlier in March, the development team provided a small update, stating that the

  console ports won't be ready until at least Summer 2025. Colossal Order has stated that its focus is on stability and performance, aiming to make the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions more polished than the initial PC release.

  Before you can get your hands on both charms, you will first have to roll credits in

  Remedy Entertainment has issued a surprise update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Control: Ultimate Edition
   </em>
  </strong>
  that adds new content, graphical enhancements, and various bug fixes at no extra cost.
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  players on PC have already received the new update, but those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will have to wait a little longer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Launched in early 2021,
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  spruced up the base game on a technical level and bundled its full suite of released DLC for current-gen consoles.
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  was even offered in the February 2021 PS Plus monthly lineup, and is currently available in the PS Plus Extra games catalog. However, some content from the base game, like pre-order bonuses, digital deluxe perks, and even a PS4-exclusive mission, was precluded from
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  , up until now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remedy has now decided to make
  <strong>
   <em>
    Control
   </em>
   's former locked content available to
   <em>
    Control: Ultimate Edition
   </em>
   players via a brand-new update
  </strong>
  for all platforms, except PS4 and Xbox One. The free
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  update includes three new outfits that were previously pre-order exclusives, namely the Astral Dive Suit, Tactical Response Gear, and Urban Response Gear. The Dr. Yoshimi Tokui's Guided Imagery Experience mission, which was once exclusive to
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's Digital Deluxe edition on PS4, will now be accessible to all
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  players as well. This mission can be unlocked by collecting the Dr. Tokui Tapes in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector, and interestingly features voiceover work by none other than legendary game auteur Hideo Kojima.

  On the technical front, the new
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  update introduces HDR support, an Ultra Ray Tracing preset, and ultrawide monitor support (up to 48:9) for PC players. PS5 and Xbox Series X/S users, meanwhile, can expect to see a new Field of View scaling setting for the gameplay camera, improved SDR visuals (from 8-bit to 10-bit), and texture streaming fixes. Other enhancements include better graphics adapter detection, screen resolution selection improvements, and rendering resolution support beyond 4K. Remedy has also addressed audio mixing issues in
  <em>
   Control: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  's cutscenes and patched multiple bugs and crashes to improve stability.
 </p>
 <p>
  This new update is undoubtedly a welcome surprise for
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  fans, especially those who missed out on the exclusive content offered with the game's 2019 launch version. The coming months should also be exciting for them, as Remedy is gearing up to release
  <em>
   FBC: Firebreak
  </em>
  , the studio's first co-op multiplayer game.
  <em>
   FBC: Firebreak
  </em>
  will share the same universe as
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  games, so it'll be interesting to see if the multiplayer game provides any hints about Remedy's upcoming
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  .

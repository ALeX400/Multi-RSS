	Before players can dive into the excitement of
	<em>
	 Star Wars: Hunters
	</em>
	with their gaming pals, they must first
	<strong>
	 complete the required number of matches to unlock the Social tab
	</strong>
	in the game. This will require players to complete 10 matches in this competitive PvP shooting game, a task which can be tracked by going to the tab from the main menu. When in the tab, there will be a notice at the top of the screen to indicate how many games are remaining before social components of the game are unlocked.

	Once unlocked, the process of adding friends in
	<em>

	is relatively simple. To add someone you know, simply
	<strong>
	 go to the Social tab and type in their username in the Friends section
	</strong>
	of the menu. Once entered, players will be able to add them to their friends list and enjoy partying up with them in competitive matches, whether together on Switch or cross-platform with a friend on a mobile platform.

 <p>
	Though the
	<strong>
	 <em>
		World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria
	 </em>
	</strong>
	event is intended to give players a power trip that normally is not attainable in other game moves, a point of contention with players was how Blizzard dealt with the "frog farm" in the Timeless Isle. In the initial days of
	<em>
	 World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria
	</em>
	, players scrambled to find ways to reach level 70 quickly and farm resources. As one of the first known farms in
	<em>
	 WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria
	</em>
	, the Gulp Frogs of the Timeless Isle are found on its southeastern shores. While this trek may lead to encounters with other creatures such as tigers, stone giants, and sprites, the Gulp Frogs' lair is easily accessible.

 <p>
	The Gulp Frogs secrete a poison that will instantly kill a player upon reaching 10 stacks of a debuff that increases with each attack. However, that did not stop "frog farms" from popping up during the first days of the
	<em>
	 WoW Remix
	</em>
	event. When killed, the Gulp Frogs originally gave high amounts of Bronze coins and Lesser Charms of Good Fortune that can be redeemed for reputation points with factions like the Shado-Pan and the Golden Lotus. The fast respawn timers on the Gulp Frogs led to players scrambling around the Timeless Isle and forming groups to kill the Gulp Frogs quickly and repeatedly before Blizzard caught wind of their deeds.

 <p>
	Though
	<em>
	 World of Warcraft
	</em>
	players are encouraged to maximize their character's power through various means, the frog farm was counter-intuitive to exploring and completing quests throughout Pandaria, which are the more accepted ways of leveling up. When news of the frog farm spread on social media, some players chose to take advantage of the situation, while others did not.

 <p>
	Days after
	<em>
	 WoW Remix
	</em>
	went live, Blizzard nerfed the Gulp Frogs by removing Lesser Charms of Good Fortune from their loot table, but they still dropped Bronze when defeated. This meant that the frog farm was effectively dead, but players who took part in the farm got to keep their rewards, including threads for the Cloak of Infinite Potential to push the cloak's statistics to levels beyond what could be reasonably obtained.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
	This led to players who did not take part in the frog farm criticizing Blizzard for not rolling back the gains made by frog farmers. However, the
	<em>
	 World of Warcraft
	</em>
	development team had plans to make things right for those players who were not frog farmers. On May 21, some data miners discovered that Blizzard created labels behind the scenes that would identify players as either frog farmers or not. The purpose of this label was made clear in the days ahead, as Blizzard compensated players who felt cheated by missing out on a popular farm.

 <p>
	To undo the damage done by the frog farm, Blizzard released a two-fold solution to reduce the power of players who participated in the farm and reward players who opted against it. For the former batch of
	<em>
	 World of Warcraft
	</em>
	players, their Cloaks of Infinite Potential had their secondary stats reduced to more reasonable levels that could easily be obtained through normal gameplay but did not touch any Bronze earned in the process. For the non-farmers, three exclusive quests that rewarded up to 40,000 Bronze were unlocked for them to complete at levels 50, 60, and 70.

			<title>How To Take Cover In Fallout 4</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	One of the biggest problems with
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Fallout 4
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is that it does not spell out the various mechanics players can take advantage of during their playthrough. Because the game lacks tutorials for things as basic as taking cover in
	<em>
	 Fallout 4
	</em>
	, players are not able to enjoy the game to its fullest.

 <p>
	Many players don't even know a cover mechanic exists in the game! Since players do not know they can take cover, they charge into gunfights or adopt a fight-or-flight strategy. However, the cover system allows players to approach each encounter tactfully. Keeping this in mind, this guide will cover everything there is to know about taking cover in
	<em>
	 Fallout 4
	</em>
	, along with other useful information.

 <p>
	Interestingly, there are numerous Reddit threads where new and old

	 also works in third-person view

	FromSoftware has an extensive history of putting hidden secrets in its games, dating all the way back to the studio's very first video game
	<em>
	 King's Field
	</em>
	, where players could find hidden treasure behind illusory walls. Of course, these walls would make a return in FromSoftware's
	<em>
	 Souls
	</em>
	series, appearing alongside a wealth of other secrets such as hidden bosses, concealed items, and even, on occasion, entirely new areas. As should be expected of FromSoftware's biggest game to date,
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Elden Ring
	 </strong>
	</em>
	is packed to the brim with similar secrets.

 <p>
	An open-world adventure on a much bigger scale than anything the developer had made before,
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	features the most secrets of any FromSoft game, ranging from classic staples like illusory walls to brand-new secrets like paintings that hint at a disguised treasure, and towers that require specific items to enter. While it may not be quite as big as the base game,
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is set to bring a new area to the RPG, one presumably flooded with secrets, and it might be useful for fans to remember a longstanding FromSoft trick before they set off.

	FromSoftware's History with Secrets Being Hidden Behind Gestures
 </h3>
 <p>
	The very first FromSoftware game to feature emotes was 2009's
	<em>
	 Demon's Souls
	</em>
	. Officially called "Gestures," these emotes allowed players to express themselves in a handful of ways, adding a bit of levity to the
	<em>
	 Demon's Souls
	</em>
	online multiplayer experience. Of course, these Gestures would return in 2011's
	<em>
	 Dark Souls
	</em>
	, where they became a prominent part of the community's enjoyment of the game. But while these Gestures remained a fun way to communicate during PvP and co-op, they were given a more useful application come
	<em>
	 Bloodborne
	</em>
	's release in 2015.

 <p>
	In
	<em>
	 Bloodborne
	</em>
	, players can find a rather unique Gesture called "Make Contact" in the Upper Cathedral Ward. If they perform that Gesture in front of the horrifying Brain of Mensis and hold it for around a minute, they'll be given the Moon Caryll Rune, which increases the number of Blood Echoes gained from killing enemies. Additionally, there are quite a few Gestures that the Doll will react to in the Hunter's Dream, such as the Bow or Applause Gestures.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Bloodborne
	</em>
	marked the first proper time players were rewarded with secrets for using their Gestures in specific locations, something that
	<em>
	 Dark Souls 3
	</em>
	took even further. After playing through a good portion of
	<em>
	 Dark Souls 3
	</em>
	's main story, players will eventually stumble upon the Path of the Dragon Gesture in the Consumed King's Garden. If players venture all the way back to the Irithyll Dungeons, they can use that Gesture to unlock an entirely new area of the game called Archdragon Peak, filled with new enemies, new loot, and one of the best boss battles in the entire game.

	Elden Ring Is Filled with Gesture Secrets
 </h3>
 <p>
	While
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	didn't hide an entire portion of the map behind an emote, it did have plenty of other Gesture-related secrets, more than any other FromSoft game before it. One of these secrets occurs fairly early on in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	when players first encounter Blaidd in the Mistwood. After learning the Snap Gesture, players can summon Blaidd down from his hiding spot and begin his questline. The Erudition Gesture can also be used at two different spots in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	to open up locked towers.

 <h3 id="shadow-of-the-erdtree-could-have-its-own-gesture-secrets">
	Shadow of the Erdtree Could Have Its Own Gesture Secrets
 </h3>
 <p>
	While FromSoftware is keeping pretty quiet on what will be included with
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	's upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it has been confirmed that the expansion will add an entirely new area to the game. According to Hidetaka Miyazaki himself, this new Land of Shadow area will be roughly the size of Limgrave from the base game, if not slightly bigger, which means that there's plenty of room for more Gesture-based secrets. Players should make sure they're paying close attention to any statues or structures that look particularly out of place.

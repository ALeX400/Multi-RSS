      <title>One Upcoming Movie May Push Disney Dreamlight Valley to Break a Tradition It Has Followed For Years</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  is arguably quite rigid about the criteria for the inclusion of the characters in its roster. The hit simulation game has added multiple characters from Disney Animation Studios properties and Pixar, but has yet to expand beyond the two companies. Looking ahead at Disney’s roster of upcoming films, one movie outside these studios could push Gameloft to add an outside character to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  When exploring
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s character roster, it's clear that Gameloft and Disney are focused on adding characters that are either cute or extremely popular. Part of this equation is the era in Disney history that most of the characters on
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s roster are from.

  Fans have been quick to point out the discrepancy in the number of early-era Disney characters and characters from the Disney Renaissance and onward. Currently, the only characters that fall outside this period in Disney’s history are Merlin, the Fairy Godmother, Oswald, and the members of the Sensational Six, composed of Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and still missing from the game, Pluto.

 <p>
  This disparity isn’t just something that fans of
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  fans have been quick to criticize, but something that Gameloft and Disney seem to have taken note of.
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s free content road map for the upcoming year, released at the
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  2024 Showcase, hints that characters from earlier in Disney Animation Studios’ history will finally be visiting the Valley.

 <p>
  The Spring and Summer 2025 images in the road map are the most solid evidence of this claim. The Spring 2025 image shows a shadowy Cheshire Cat hiding in a tree, with the description “Step into a land of wonder and meet new friends along the way.” This suggests that characters from
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  , a film from Disney Animation Studios’ Silver Age, will be added to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  . The Summer 2025 image depicts Skull Rock from
  <em>
   Peter Pan
  </em>
  , another Silver Age film, with the description reading “Solve an ancient mystery and discover who is waiting inside Skull Rock.”

 <p>
  With both images and descriptions confirming that earlier Disney characters will be added to the Valley, it seems that Gameloft and Disney are trying to bridge the gap between old-school characters and newer favorites. This also shows that Disney will follow fan reception, as fans have called for older characters to be included in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  However, with
  <em>
   Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s penchant for adding primarily cute and popular characters, it would be unsurprising to see Gameloft change its tune back to this method of character addition. This could prove especially true when
  <em>
   The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu
  </em>
  comes out in 2026.

 <p>
  Grogu is one of the cutest characters under the Disney umbrella. His introduction in
  <em>
   The Mandalorian
  </em>
  has resulted in millions of Baby Yoda memes and merchandise. It would be unsurprising to see Disney properties take advantage of Grogu’s popularity, especially in video games.

 <p>
  This would be a radical change for
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  as Grogu is a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  character. Considering that fans of
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  have lists of characters from Disney Animation Studios and Pixar that they desperately want to be added to the game, it’s unlikely that, despite his cute appearance, Grogu’s addition would result in positive reception from fans.

 <h3 id="grogu-as-a-companion">
  Grogu as a Companion
 </h3>
 <p>
  Therefore, it would make more sense for Grogu to be added as a companion rather than a full-on character. Companions are creatures that follow a player around and are categorized as wardrobe items. While most companions in the game are simply cute animals,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  has used characters from Disney Animation Studios as companions previously, like Moana’s pet chicken Hei Hei and her pig Pua.

 <p>
  Adding Grogu as a companion in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  would be a great compromise between Disney and fans, allowing for a Star Wars property to be added to the game without disrupting
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s character roster. There’s no definitive proof that Grogu will be added to the game, but it’s still fun to imagine how he would fit into

  <em>
   Royale High
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game in which your fantasies come true. The main location is a palace and around it is a beautiful area with a fountain in the middle. You can walk around it with your friends and look for different activities. The palace is basically a school, so you can go to interesting classes, such as drawing.

  You can easily redeem codes in almost any
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game. Thanks to this option, games get new players, so developers try to make everything as simple as possible. In
  <em>
   Royale High
  </em>
  , you can redeem the code in a few clicks, you just need to find the Shop in the game interface. However, the game interface is a bit unclear, so if you don't play
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games often, you might get confused at first. To save you time searching for the right button, we have created a guide explaining how to redeem codes in
  <em>
   Royale High

  It's been incredible to witness how much the free-to-play multiplayer scene has exploded with online games. Every company is trying to get a piece of this craze and while many titles can bleed together and seem derivative of each other, it's also pushed some developers to challenge the genre and come up with something fun and different.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valorant
   </em>
  </strong>
  made a strong impression on audiences during its beta phase, but it's recently put out its full release and allowed players to see what it's all about.

 <p>
  It's a satisfying tactical first-person shooter, but there are many games out there that conjure a similar vibe.
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  may have a gameplay loop that can be pretty unique in its own right, but that doesn't mean that other titles can't scratch that itch, either. There are several titles in the same vein if players love the gameplay loop of this title, hitting the same notes in some way or the other and letting players enjoy some truly pulse-pounding gameplay that is incredibly tense yet satisfying.

   </strong>
   Valorant is one of the fastest-growing shooters in the industry, and players have not only lost interest in playing it, but the community has become even bigger and bigger day after day. And that's because Riot Games always knows what it's doing!

   Finding competitive games at the same level as Valorant might not result in more than a few options, but by loosening the strict filters and focusing on each strength point of Valorant solely, there are many great games out there that can give players a satisfying experience.

  <em>
   Battleborn
  </em>
  was one of the first live-service shooter games to come out that was perfectly serviceable but didn't do anything too major to help it stand out from the rest of the pack. As a result, the player base of this title dwindled to the point where it eventually stopped receiving any support and was quietly taken off the market.

 <p>
  It's a shame since the lack of developments in this genre has made it clear that
  <em>
   Battleborn
  </em>
  did many good things that were pretty underappreciated at the time. Fans have given this game a revival of sorts with

  Aside from its captivating settings and narrative,
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  is also known for its skill-based gunplay, which enables competitive PvP action. The multiplayer mode in
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  evolved with each new entry, even though the campaign had its shortcomings some time. Even
  <em>
   Halo 5: Guardians
  </em>
  , with all the campaign criticisms, excelled in delivering a competitive multiplayer experience.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  leading the series now, the multiplayer experience has evolved even more. Although the game experienced a rough launch in the beginning, 343 Industries did not give up and the support from
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  continued to make a top-notch competitive shooter. The game still receives new content and it has a decent player base.

  Veterans from DICE banded together to create a live-service shooter that would help the series evolve in a new direction, and
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  doesn't disappoint. The focus on parkour movement coupled with destructive maps makes for a cathartic multiplayer experience that fans can't get enough of.

 <p>
  Sure, the game has some kinks that need to be ironed out, but this is the case for every live-service shooter in its early goings.
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  has settled upon a brilliant formula, and it's up to Embark Studios to ensure that they maintain this hype instead of turning the game into a bloated experience with later updates.

  The idea of playing as space-dwarven miners in extraterrestrial worlds and taking out a wealth of unique enemies sounds like a great time, and this is just one of the many reasons why
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  has become such a massive hit. Fans of
  <em>

  who want a different take on this zombie co-op shooter's gameplay will love this title for its great visuals, scintillating combat, and roguelike nature.

 <p>
  No playthrough feels the same, allowing players to have a great time with their friends as they engage in multiple playthroughs to try and complete missions in the most efficient manner possible. There's a fair bit of tactical planning involved in this game that will feel right at home for fans of
  <em>
   Valorant

  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  was a brilliant mix of Soulslike gameplay and third-person shooting that could be incredibly challenging at times. Players had to be very careful about engaging enemies, and playing in co-op was always a plus for players who appreciated the help as they took down enemies and bosses together. So, while fans of the first game were excited to see what
  <strong>
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  had to offer, no one expected the sequel to be such a huge step up from its predecessor.

 <p>
  The roguelike elements from the first game were expanded upon considerably, with the art design and gameplay being simply spectacular. Players couldn't be faulted for just taking a break and appreciating the scenery... that is until a horde of enemies decided to ambush them in the hopes of taking the heroes out in no time flat.
  <em>

  is an excellent game that fans will have a great time with, especially if they love challenging co-op shooters.

  When playing

  , it is quite difficult to set boundaries between the game and the real world, and that's one of the main challenges in this game because players will have to control recoil, hear defeating gunshots, and keep their aim at their targets while excessive muzzle flash blocks their sight.

  While Destiny 2 is far bigger than a competitive shooter, it does feature a multitude of PvP game modes. Most gamers know Destiny 2 for its incredible raids and dungeons, as well as the story-based missions, but the game does give value to those who have mastered gunplay.

  Aside from the classic PvP game modes, Destiny 2 also delivers some special competitive events during each season such as Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner. These events remain active for a limited time, but players who manage to level up and get the objectives done are rewarded with higher-tier PvP weapons.

   Valorant
  </em>
  's gameplay will get a ton of mileage out of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Insurgency: Sandstorm

  . This game is unlike most other popular squad-based FPS shooters out there, with tactics being key to attaining success. Any player who decides to take matters into their own hands will be shot down faster than they can blink, which speaks volumes when it comes to how tough this game is.

  Regardless of one's personal opinion when it comes to
  <em>
   League of Legends

  , there's no denying that the game is mechanically sound and brilliant at creating engaging scenarios for the player to participate. Each multiplayer session takes a long while but is pretty satisfying when players manage to beat a tough team.

  Call of Duty is probably one of the easiest competitive shooters to enter to. Unlike Valorant or other hero shooters that require the player to know how each hero works and how they can counter their abilities, Call of Duty delivers a simple shooter experience.

 <p>
  Of course, there are still a few things to master in Call of Duty too, such as learning how to move around the map faster, or how to aim better. However, these are just the basics of every competitive shooter. So, at the very least, there is nothing extra to lengthen the learning curve in Call of Duty.

  Many shooter games take players to dark environments and give them night-vision goggles to deliver an immersive experience, but
  <em>
   Blindfire
  </em>
  does the same in a very different way. The game is a competitive, team-based PvP shooter set in dark arenas. Players don't have night-vision goggles, but they have access to a scanner that can reveal the position of enemies for a brief period.
 </p>

 <p>
  As a result, players will lean more on the sound cues, and they really need to shoot when they are sure about sporting the target, otherwise the shot burst will just expose their position to the other enemies.

  came out over a decade ago and even though the team-based multiplayer shooter community had grown exponentially in that time,

  Admittedly, the game's community is smaller now, but it's a testament to how gameplay doesn't have to be overly complicated to connect.
  <em>

  For the longest time, Tom Clancy titles like
  <em>
   Rainbow Six
  </em>
  focused on grounded espionage and tactical shooters. The list of games has greatly expanded, and the more recent

 <p>
  In Arena, the developers take the same gunplay but add a more competitive flavor to it. So, instead of exploring the brutal maps and scavenging for valuable loot, players are only tasked with killing each other in Escape From Tarkov Arena on small, close-quarter maps. The good thing about Escape From Tarkov arena is the fact that it uses hero-style characters, and players can unlock them by making progress. Each character comes with a fixed loadout, which makes the entire experience a bit more challenging.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the few games on the market that perfectly captures the feeling of playing pencil-and-paper
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  . The only thing missing from the game is the ability of players to truly unleash their imagination, creating unique worlds, monsters, spells, items, and more. What better way to remedy this than with mods, allowing dedicated community members to let their creativity run wild by augmenting the game to their heart's desire?

 <p>
  The Warlock class in the game can, while still being fun, feel lacking at times, and is often best suited for players choosing to multi-class. The mods on this list perfectly augment the class, offering new, unique ways to play, bringing the spell list up to date with modern
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  , and ultimately rounding out an already strong class.

 <p>
  This mod is a simple addition to the Warlock skill set in the game, adding Bane, Detect Magic, and Speak With Animals to the first-level spell options for the class. While this isn't as flashy as some of the later entries here, what this mod does is bring the class up to date with its current state in the official
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  rulebook.

 <p>
  All of these spells are useful additions to the retinue, with Bane making it harder for enemies to hit the player, and Speak With Animals making the questlines for Scratch and the Owlbear cub a little more engaging.

  The Patron Spells mod is very similar to the previous entry, simply modifying the available spells at certain levels. What this mod does specifically is allow the player to have all spells on their chosen patron's spell list permanently prepared. This expands the choices available to a player at any given moment, provided they have hit level 3, which is when this ability is made available.

  , which is a request many players have had since the game was first released.

 <p>
  The First Vampire is a subclass from the
  <em>
   Grim Hollow
  </em>
  tabletop setting, brought to life in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  with this mod. While players have had the opportunity to live out their vampire fantasies with the character Astarion, this mod expands the vampiric possibilities present in the base game. The subclass allows the player access to a specific, modified spell list, as all subclasses have. However, it also adds several new abilities and allows Warlocks to use an ability akin to the Druid's wild shape, with a gothic twist.

 <p>
  This is one of the few mods on this list that doesn't take rules and concepts from Wizard of the Coast's official rule book, making it a slightly more unique and creative endeavor. It's hard not to have fun with the vampiric abilities and gothic-inspired spell list.

 <p>
  Adding another patron to the game, the Celestial Warlock mod allows players to make a pact with a celestial being, as they could if they played
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  itself. This subclass turns the warlock from a devotee of dark forces to something closer to a cleric or paladin, adding several healing spells to the available spell list, as well as several other radiant spells.

 <p>
  On top of this, there are several abilities added that provide unique sources of healing, temporary hit points, and other flavor additions that truly make the warlock feel like a force of celestial power. If a player has ever wanted to be a lawful force of godly power but feels like Paladins are a bit too bulky, and clerics are a little too religious, this mod is the perfect in-between.

 <p>
  The Hexblade Warlock takes what the Pact of the Blade offers and cranks it up to 11. Another subclass taken from the rulebooks for 5e, the Hexblade adds several new spells to the warlock repertoire and expands the possibility of the pact weapons seen in the Pact of the Blade. Smiting enemies down with demonic, sentient weapons, summoned through the power of some dark creature, truly makes the Warlock feel like a class intended to be used for close-range combat.

 <p>
  This subclass also allows the player to resurrect the soul of a slain foe to fight for them, which does somewhat scratch the itch of playing as a Lich, raising the dead, and terrorizing the Sword Coast. If any player has ever yearned to feel like a true knight of death, this mod is the perfect addition to their game.

 <p>
  Yet another 5e patron brought to life, the Fathomless offers the warlock the option to play into the fantasy of being a pirate, a god of the sea, or somewhere in between. With the ability to summon a spectral tentacle, walk faster on wet surfaces, and cast spells that feel reminiscent of a deep sea storm, the Fathomless subclass is an incredibly fun way to blaze a path along the Sword Coast.

  The Undead, what many may think would function as a necromancer, is less about raising an army of the dead than it is about empowering the player with the power of an undead patron. The player gets the ability to transform into a visage of their chosen patron, allowing them to terrify enemies as a reaction, as well as removing the need to eat, drink, and sleep.

 <p>
  Unlike the vampiric subclass previously mentioned, this mod is focused on bolstering the player's necrotic damage output, while reducing the damage they take from said damage. They also gain increased temporary hit points when activating their "Form of Dread," transforming into a ghastly image of their patron's likeness. While a large number of additions from this mod are roleplaying or flavor additions, the gameplay changes made are satisfying and fun and embody the rules as written in the official 5e rulebooks.

  Of all the mods listed, The Dread Overlord feels the most comprehensive, adding a huge number of new spells, abilities, icons, and items. The player starts with their choice of three brand-new weapons, the ability to raise the dead to fight in their stead. This mod even goes beyond the level cap of the base game, adding power increases all the way to level 20, as is the case in the tabletop rules for
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  .

  This mod is the perfect choice for any player looking for a new experience, whether they are familiar with this subclass or entirely new to it. It is a huge addition to the game, offering new content for the entire duration and beyond, and allows for the embodiment of a brand-new power fantasy that was entirely lacking in the base game.

      <title>The Last of Us Part 3 Needs to Tread Carefully With Its Next Infected Types</title>

  If
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Last of Us Part 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which might not get a release until 2027, decides to introduce new types of infected, it must do so thoughtfully. The series has built its appeal on a deeply immersive, post-apocalyptic setting where the infected aren’t mere game obstacles, but haunting remnants of a society lost to a fungal plague. Any additional infected types, therefore, should feel plausible, and derive from the underlying biology of the Cordyceps fungus and the themes of survival and humanity that define the series.

  In
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  , Naughty Dog expanded its infected roster with the Shambler, an explosive, bloated infected that oozes corrosive spores upon attack, and the Rat King, a towering amalgam of infected individuals fused together, almost like a twisted symbiote, among others. They hit home in the game’s established lore to some extent, as both of them were rooted in Cordyceps' evolutionary potential and the game’s brutal atmosphere. However, there's a fine line between enhancing gameplay with these infected types and slipping into something that feels too video game-y.

  The evolution of infected types must feel natural, and it’s best if it takes a thematic turn. For instance, in
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  , the infected could develop based on the specific regions and conditions that survivors encounter, especially if the game explores new locations outside of America. The series could reveal Cordyceps strains that have mutated differently in various climates, and zero in on a horrifying diversity within the infected without departing from a biological basis. Shamblers and even Clickers as an evolution from
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  Runners due to prolonged infection are a good example of this.

 <p>
  Each infected could therefore offer a window into the world’s decay, with new types based on distinct environmental challenges rather than the need for new combat mechanics. Secondly, infected types moving forward should serve to highlight the toll that survival has taken on The
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  characters themselves. They could mirror the desperation, isolation, or decay in human survivors.

     For example, introducing new infected types that demonstrate bizarre hibernation cycles or solitary behaviors could subtly reference the fractured psyches of those still alive. They could make things interesting as both adversaries and symbols of remnants of humanity that have been shaped by loss and fear.

  The Game Shouldn’t Add Any Infected Types for Shock Value

 <p>
  A bizarre infected that looks like a cyclops, much like an undead Damrod troll from
  <em>
   Rings of Power
  </em>
  , for instance, would be an underwhelming addition. This is an extreme example but the point is, the series needs to stick to its genre of survival instead of turning into a horror fiction. Yes, it’s still fiction but the fact that it uses actual science to back up the cordyceps’ evolutionary infection is what gives spine to the storyline. Introducing fantasy-infected types could affect this feel-real dynamic.

 <p>
  Ultimately, the next chapter in
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  should aim to introduce infected types that feel like a natural extension of the story’s themes and the harsh realities of a cordyceps-ravaged world.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  players should feel that each new infected reflects a potential adaptation or survival trait, not an over-the-top mutation designed for dramatic effect. The tension between innovation and fidelity to the series’ aesthetic, therefore, will be crucial.

 <p>
  By treading carefully,
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  can push the boundaries of horror without compromising the emotional integrity that fans cherish. The world of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a place where reality has twisted but remains grounded. A world where each encounter feels like a glimpse into a terrifying yet strangely familiar reflection of humanity’s own traits. Touching base on darker themes like cannibalism was dark and horrifying but only made the game feel more real and that’s how
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  infected-types need to be approached as well.

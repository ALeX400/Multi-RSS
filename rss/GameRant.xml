      Capcom offers Resident Evil and Devil May Cry titles for under $2 on Xbox 360 before the marketplace closure on July 29.

      Xbox promises major discounts as the store shut down nears, with two waves of discounts already available.

      Fans were disappointed by the lack of certain Capcom games in the sale, but more titles may be added in the final wave next month.

  Capcom has given its fans an opportunity to grab a number of its past titles, including several
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  entries, at heavily discounted prices on
  <strong>
   Xbox 360
  </strong>
  . Last year, Xbox sadly announced that it'll be shuttering its 360 Marketplace in July 2024, warning gamers that all digital titles in the Xbox 360 store will become permanently unavailable after July 29.

 <p>
  Thankfully, Xbox isn't letting the 360 store go out without a bang, as it's promised a wealth of major discounts to hit the marketplace as July 29 approaches. Two waves of discounts have already hit Xbox 360's digital storefront, which has seen titles like
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Far Cry 4
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  become available for just a few dollars. Xbox is planning a third and final update in July, which will see another large batch of 360 games be sliced to mere pennies on the dollar.

 <p>
  With just over a month to go until the Xbox 360 Marketplace shuts down, Capcom chimed in with its contribution to Xbox 360's big blowout sale. Capcom highlighted a list of some of its biggest games from the 360 era, all going on sale for no more than $1.99. A number of entries from Capcom franchises like
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  populate the list. Even titles like
  <em>
   Bionic Commando
  </em>
  (2009) and Don's Nod's
  <em>
   Remember Me
  </em>
  have joined the mix.

  While the pricing of these older Capcom games is certainly satisfactory, many fans expressed their disappointment at the low number of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  games included in the list.
  <em>
   Street Fighter X Tekken
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike Online Edition
  </em>
  are the only titles from Capcom's juggernaut fighting franchise to be included, leaving fans wondering about
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4.
  </em>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  , which has become more popular than ever thanks to the release of
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  this year, is also missing. Despite an already long list of discounts, it's entirely possible that Capcom could be planning to add even more of its games as part of Xbox's third and final wave of discounted 360 titles coming next month.

 <p>
  While many major Xbox 360 games have been discounted as part of the Xbox 360 store's final months, there are certainly still a lot of big, important Xbox games missing from the sale. Not a single
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Forza,
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  title appears on the current list of discounted Xbox 360 games. It's likely that some titles from these tentpole Xbox franchises will show up in the Xbox 360 sale next month as the store's July 29 closure approaches.

  <em>
   Witcher 3

  developer CD Projekt Red has congratulated
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  studio FromSoftware for the latter's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  overtaking the former's
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  and becoming the best-rated expansion ever released. The new
  <em>

  DLC refreshes the game's content with a new story campaign, new weapons, new enemies, new locations, and more.

 <p>
  Back in 2022, the fantasy action RPG game from veteran game director Hidetaka Miyazaki came out to commercial as well as critical success, bagging multiple Game of the Year awards.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has since gone on to sell more than 25 million copies, and its highly anticipated DLC,
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , has also hit the ground running.

  According to OpenCritic,
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  is now the highest-rated expansion in history. As a result, it has also toppled
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  DLC as the highest-rated DLC for an RPG, a distinction that CDPR's game had held for the past 8 years. The
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  DLC holds an average rating of 94 based on 63 critic reviews as opposed to
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  's average rating of 92 based on 78 critic reviews. In a tweet via
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  's official Twitter account, CDPR gave its congratulations to FromSoftware upon
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's successful launch and praised the studio's "stellar work."

  and
  <em>
   Balatro

  Even though
  <em>

  is currently available for all

  unplayable on Steam Deck after the latest update. While the Japanese developer didn't reveal when it will roll out a fix for this issue, based on its prompt response, fans may rest assured that they will be able to experience the next chapter in the journey of the Elden Lord sooner rather than later.

    Updated June 21, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. The content roll-out for The Final Shape continues this week as
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's first 12-man activity, Excision, launches a Grandmaster difficulty version. Bungie has promised that this version will not only be difficult, but it also teased that the reward for finishing it will "totally be worth it."

  Alongside Excision, the Dual Destiny exotic mission continues to divide
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  fans. As the only way to unlock the previously revealed exotic class items, many praise Bungie for adding a completely unique and interesting activity to the game. However, there are those who feel the exact opposite, frustrated that the only way to unlock these unique exotics is through a forced cooperative activity.

  In addition to all of that, the

  weekly reset is back again, bringing refreshed content, activities, and rewards. For a complete look at all the new content available for the week of June 18, including Nightfalls, Crucible modes, and challenges, here is everything players need to know.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  is once again giving players the opportunity to land on the OG map, but this time around, there are some major changes being made. For years, one of the most frequent requests among the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  community was the return of the Chapter 1 map, also known as Athena Island or OG map. It got to a point where players would try to replicate it as closely as possible in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Creative. Epic Games had to step in and remove some of these islands, as they copied the company's intellectual property. It eventually caved and brought back Athena Island with the release of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Season OG.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Season OG only lasted a month, but it was one of the most significant moments in the game's history. Despite its popularity over the years, it was thanks to the release of Season OG that
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  reached a player count record: over 44 million players logged in to try out the OG map. While many had never landed on Athena Island before, others were brought back to experience it once again. Many gamers were sad to say goodbye to the OG locations once that season came to an end.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1086} -->

 <p>
  Despite it being removed for the second time, some players never lost hope that the Chapter 1 map would become available permanently as its own game mode, like Team Rumble, for example. Even though it has not been confirmed how long it'll be available, a new game mode based on the OG map is coming to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , and it's titled Fortnite Reload. It appears that Fortnite Reload will feature a remixed version of the Chapter 1 island with some fan-favorite
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  locations, such as Tilted Towers, Pleasant Park, and Retail Row. On top of that, there is a brand-new location named Sandy Sheets and a smaller version of Loot Lake named Lil' Loot Lake.

 <p>
  The teaser is only seven seconds long, but it is clear that this version of the map is much smaller compared to the OG island. It is possible that the Battle Royale matches that will take place in Fortnite Reload won't be meant for 100 players. Before Team Rumble, there was another big teams game mode called "50 vs. 50." However, it was easier to keep this a permanent mode with fewer players, which is why Team Rumble has teams of 16 gamers competing against each other. This could support the idea that Fortnite Reload will be a permanent addition to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .

  </strong>
  's story is now complete in all senses, having come full circle since its 2020 launch. In the wake of its initial release,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  experienced at times near unprecedented levels of backlash, mainly due to its technical state on older generation platforms as well as for missing some key features and elements that were originally promised. Developer CD Projekt Red took responsibility for these shortcomings, and by the latter half of 2023, via the 2.0 update combined with The Phantom Liberty DLC, had transitioned the title into a stable and satisfactory state.

  Now that
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's development is officially concluded, with no additional content planned, CDPR is beginning early work on its sequel, currently known as Project Orion. Though it will likely still be a while before further details about it are revealed, fans are already speculating on how it will build on
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's mechanics and themes.
  <em>
   CP 2077
  </em>
  's breadth of quests spanned the tonal range from deadly serious to slapstick absurdity, and one of the standout side missions falling more into the latter category was the "Machine Gun" quest, wherein fans could befriend an AI-enhanced weapon with a strong will of its own. As a memorable inclusion, Project Orion should seek to have another mission in this same vein.

  Cyberpunk 2077's 'Machine Gun' Mission and Skippy
 </h3>
 <p>
  While exploring the seedy back alleys of Night City, players can discover and encounter
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  Skippy, an AI-enhanced Smart pistol with a unique personality and related mechanic. Upon picking up the gun, a holographic projection of an animated bullet, Skippy, will cheerily greet protagonist V and ask which of two modes they would like to set the weapon in. If "Stone Cold Killer" is selected as the initial setting, Skippy's smart bullets will go for deadly accurate headshots on enemies. Meanwhile, "Puppy-Loving Pacifist" aims for limbs in a less lethal approach.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  However, once players rack up 50 kills or incapacitated foes, Skippy will decide on its own to switch to the opposite setting and remain there. It's a highly entertaining and unexpected turn, showing off the fun details of the world and providing players with a unique armament in the process. Fans can also return Skippy to its original owner, officer Regina Jones, for an alternate reward should they feel his constant chatter is too much to handle or are unhappy with the mode he's stuck himself in.

  How Project Orion Could Include a 'Machine Gun' Styled Quest
 </h3>
 <p>
  With it being such a distinctive quest, "Machine Gun" is ripe for potential expansion and iteration in Project Orion. The concept of a sentient talking weapon that independently decides its level of lethality aligns perfectly with genre sensibilities, and Skippy's particular brand adds great charm and humor contrasted against some of the more dour aspects in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  . Whether
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's sequel moves to another location or remains in Night City, it could easily include Skippy again or have more weapons like it that inject a similar flavor to the story and setting.

  Any of the arms manufacturers in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's universe could produce another gun like Skippy, or perhaps even multiple versions of it, offering a collection of unique and powerful weapons, each of which could have an exaggerated and entertaining AI personality alongside multiple firing modes. Another approach could be for CD Projekt Red to overhaul the crafting system in Project Orion, allowing players to possibly create their own personalized homemade versions of weapons like Skippy, and upgrading them as they go along, resulting in a valuable piece of equipment that also serves as a sort of companion. Whatever other directions Project Orion takes, it would be an excellent inclusion to see a Skippy-like weapon crop up again.

   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Bioware's latest entry into the beloved
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  franchise, features everything fans want from a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, including choices, a rich setting, and great companion characters with their own stories and romance pathways. It also has a total of 52 Achievements and Trophies available for players to earn while playing the game.

 <p>
  Some of these Achievements and Trophies are unlocked through normal game play by anyone who plays the game's main story, but there are others that are hidden and not clearly telegraphed to the player. One such achievement is the
  <strong>
   In Peace
  </strong>
  Achievement/Trophy, which can only be earned through completing an unmarked quest after certain in-game events.

  <strong>
   main story quest Fire and Ice

  With the Blight in retreat, flowers are returning to certain parts of the Hossberg Wetlands. The first of three flowers necessary for the achievement can be
  <strong>
   found in the Sheltered Glade region
  </strong>
  of the Hossberg Wetlands map, in the space where Rook finds Evka and Antoine after completion of Something's Coming. Many players will pick up the first flower without realizing there's an attached achievement, so if you go back to the Sheltered Glade and find it isn't there, this may have happened, and there's no reason to worry.

  The third and final flower required for the achievement can be found in the Solitude's Edge region of the Hossberg Wetlands map. This one is easy to reach as it's essentially
  <strong>
   right next to the Beacon

  , so it's just a short walk away. It's in the same area as the blight puzzle.

  Once all three flowers are gathered, it's time to take them where they need to go. In the Blighted Shallows section of the map, the arena where Rook and the team fought the blighted dragons in Fire and Ice is still accessible. Go there, jump over the wall, and head to the middle of the arena. When prompted,
  <strong>
   put the flowers onto the ground
  </strong>
  and a spirit of Hope will appear.

  Warriors in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  are powerful vanguards and fighters that cleave their foes with brutal might, and for that to happen, they need the best weapons to make the most out of their abilities. During the earlier stages of the game, is not always possible to get the perfect weapon, but there are various early-game options for those playing a Warrior Rook.

 <p>
  Warriors use one-handed blades, picks, axes, and shields, and they can also carry a two-handed weapon like a Greataxe, a Warhammer, or a Polearm. This catalog showcases eight of the best weapons players can get during the early game, with information on how to find them, builds, and a full description of their perks.

 <p>
  The Executioner's Blade can be purchased for 600 gold at the Antivan Crow Faction Vendor, in Treviso. This blade is a standard sword and causes more damage with Charged attacks, which in turn cause severe damage to Overwhelmed (Stagger Bar Depleted) targets. The two first perks of this sword are easily obtainable at the earlier stages of the game since there are several copies of this Blade both in Minrathous and Treviso in early Quests.

 <p>
  This blade is ideal for those players looking to build a Shield-Bearer Rook, which is a solid choice for those looking to counter and generate more Takedowns. There are plenty of Perks in the Warrior Skill Tree that benefit from causing Stagger, and others that generate Health and Ultimate energy each time players execute a Takedown, so the Executioner's Blade is meant to become a core item for these builds.

 <p>
  This sword is ideal for those Warriors looking to invest in the Reaper build, which focuses on generating Necrotic Damage and spreading this affliction through the battlefield. The Dark Shards empowers Necrotic Damage and as it becomes more powerful, spreads it across other enemies each time Rook scores a Critical Hit. Since there are many abilities that guarantee a Critical Hit with a Shield Toss, this can become really powerful, since it would unleash a Necrotic blast on large groups of enemies.

 <p>
  The Dark Shard can be found in one of the first Companion Recruitment Quests, Sea Of Blood, in the Ossuary. After rescuing Lucanis Dellamorte, keep moving forward and reach the first plateau of the Upper Inner Cells. After defeating the Demons, look for a chest that contains the first copy of this sword. Subsequent copies are found throughout the adventure, and these will empower the Weapon's stats and unlock more Traits.

 <p>
  Perhaps, the best weapon players can get early on. It is found in the same spot as The Point, in Treviso, so getting there once players finish the Sea of Blood Quest is quite easy. Each blow with this weapon will effectively reduce the Defense of enemies permanently, which means it doesn't depend on a counter, or decay over time: It just drops and stays there. This means that if a High Dragon comes roaring in the face of whoever wields this blade, and has 150 armor, it can lose all its defenses by the time players finish their third 10-hit combo on them.

 <p>
  To make things even better, once enemies hit 0 Defense, they receive an additional 50% damage, calculated from the overall damage Rook causes with each hit. This is why this weapon is so powerful, and players shouldn't underestimate it, since its base damage will also scale with their level, meaning they don't need to invest resources to power it up.

 <p>
  The Raider's Cleaver is found in the second chest while completing In Entropy's Graps, Bellara's Introductory Quest. This one-handed axe is perfect for Warriors looking for a Bleed build, and as it grows in power so do its perks. The first perk causes extra damage to enemies who don't have Armor or Barrier. The second Perk will apply Bleeding with each Final Attack, that is, the last attack of a singular combo chain.

 <p>
  Then the third perk is one of the most broken in the whole game, it adds an extra +10% of Critical Damage for every Bleeding enemy surrounding Rook. And finally, the Legendary perk makes Bleeding damage DoT benefit from the Critical Damage bonus, becoming even more brutal. Pair this weapon with the Bleeding Shard Ring to cause mayhem on the battlefield.

  During the "Missing Relic Case" Quest, following Neve Gallus through the streets of Minrathous will have players visiting several Market stalls. Between them, there's a Blacksmith shop well hidden, near the second spot where Neve Needs to Investigate a Vision. If players browse that shop, they will be able to purchase their first Crystalline Greataxe for 1050 Gold. And trust me on this, this is the best Investment they can make.

  The axe is powerful and causes cold damage instead of physical damage, making Warriors freeze and shatter foes all around. But, as this weapon unlocks more perks, it also makes Chilled apply Necrosis and turns the Necrosis damage into Cold Damage, which is quite broken if players mix the Reaper with Mourn Watch Perks, with some Lords of Fortune Perks as well.

  The Warrior can specialize in wielding a shield and doing Perfect Counters, that is, blocking at the very last moment and causing Staggering, then attacking immediately to unleash a powerful combo that causes extra damage. The Sentinel's Glory is specifically designed for those players who want to counter everything to beat the game.

 <p>
  The Shield can be found early on, during the Spirits of the Dalish quest, and a second and third upgrade quite early as they progress through Act 2, so there's no need to spend the whole game looking for additional copies. Once players unlock the third perk, it's all about blocking at the right time and unleashing powerful counters and Takedowns. The ideal shield for Tanks.

   Jaheira is not the most popular companion in Baldur’s Gate 3, but she definitely has potential if the player wishes to make use of her. Halsin can outshine Jaheira as he is recruitable before, but the player can still make the most of her by multiclassing her.

  Jaheira is a possible companion that the player will only run into for the first time after entering Act 2 of the game, specifically inside of the Shadow Cursed Lands.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":719} -->
 <p>
  The player will need to be careful due to the curses around and reach the Last Light Inn. There, the second they step in, they’ll be confronted by Jaheira. Jaheira is the leader of the Harpers, and will be hostile to the player at first, but the player can talk their way through this situation and get on her good side.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1041} -->

 <p>
  To recruit her, the player’s main goal will be to basically keep her alive until recruiting her permanently is an option. In the confrontation between Isobel and Marcus, the player should definitely side with Isobel, as the other option will make it almost impossible to guarantee Jaheira’s survival.

 <p>
  The player must also make sure to not kill Nightsong, as her survival will be essential. During Act 2’s climax, the player will be able to recruit her temporarily, which is definitely the way to go. After the battle is over, the player must once again speak to Jaheira and invite her over to become a permanent member of the player’s roster.

  Jaheira is not a new character to many fans of
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  . Indeed, this character had appeared in both
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 2
  </em>
  , before making her newest appearance in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3.

  Jaheira is a Half-elf, specifically a high Half Elf, which would make her the second possible companion of that exact race and sub race, after Shadowheart. When it comes to her class, she’s a Druid, which can also mean she’s possibly not the player’s only Druid, if the player has Halsin in the party. Jaheira has a default subclass, which is the Circle of the Land.

 <p>
  Her background is that of the Soldier, just like Lae’zel, which will give her proficiencies in athletics and Intimidation. Besides that, she also has proficiencies in animal handling and nature.

  As previously mentioned, Jaheira starts off as a Druid belonging to the circle of the Land. However, as a Druid, she has access to two other options she can reclass into, the circle of the Moon and The Circle of The Spores.

 <p>
  The circle of land is the best sub class for Druids who want to focus on spell casting, with their Natural Recovery. The Circle of Moon is the best class for shapeshifting, and the Circle of the Spores is the best subclass to cause status effects on enemies.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Overall, all subclasses are valid options for Jaheira, but the very best Druid subclass will always be the Circle of the Moon, which makes the Druid class stand as unique. If the player already has Halsin as a Circle of the Moon Druid and would like something else for Jaheira, the player can instead keep her as Circle of the Land subclass.

  At level 1 as a Druid, she will get the ability to use Druid spellcasting.

 <p>
  Level 2 is when the player will pick her subclass as the Circle of the Moon. She will be able to make use of combat shape, and specifically unlock the following wild shapes: Cat, Badger, Wolf, Spider, and Bear. She will also get Lunar Mend.

 <p>
  At Level 4, the player will be able to pick a Druid Cantrip, and a good option here would be Thorn Whip. It will allow Jaheira to pull enemies closer to attack. At that level, she also unlocks new wild shapes, Deep Rothe and Dire Raven.
 </p>

 <p>
  At this level, as well as levels 8 and 12, she will get to pick Feats. For Jaheira, the best options for her are as follows:

 <p>
  • Magic Initiate: Cleric. Cleric spellcasting ability is the same as Druids, as they both use Wisdom. Since the Druid spells are not that diverse, taking some spells from Clerics will be of good help.

 <p>
  At Level 5, she will get Wild Strike, a class feature. This will allow her to do an additional attack after attacking in wild shape.

 <p>

 <p>
  At Level 10, she gets another Druid cantrip. A good option is Shillelagh. It transforms Jaheira’s staff or club into a magic weapon. She also unlocks Improved Wild Strike and new Wild Shape - Dilophosaurus, as well as Air Myrmidon, Earth Myrmidon, Fire Myrmidon, as well as Water Myrmidon.

 <p>
  Jaheira is an underused character in Baldur’s Gate 3, simply for the fact that she gets added later on in the game, and by that point, the player probably already has a Druid character, Halsin. Because of that, it can be good to Multiclass Jaheira in order to make her stand out from her fellow Druid, Halsin.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The player has many options when it comes to multiclassing Jaheira. However, here, Jaheira will be a Multiclass between the Druid class and the Rogue class.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1072} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  To start the multiclassing, the player wants to start Jaheira off as a Druid, which she will already be. At level 1 as Druid, she will unlock Druid Spellcasting. Some good spell options for her at this point are Entangle and Cure Wounds. When it comes to cantrips, Shillelagh and Thorn Whip are good options.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":309} -->
 <p>
  At level 2, Jaheira should remain a Druid, and now, she will get to choose her Druid Circle. Circle of the Moon, the Circle of the Land, or the Circle of the Spores are the options. For the sake of this Multiclass, Jaheira should go into the Circle of the Land. This will give her Natural Recovery and she can pick an additional cantrip. At this level, she will also unlock four wild shapes, Cat, Badger, Wolf, and Spider.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":732} -->
 <p>
  Now, Jaheira should switch over at level 3 to the Rogue class, making her a Druid 2 - Rogue 1, so far. At this level, she will unlock from the Rogue Class, Sneak Attack (Melee), as well as Sneak Attack (Ranged).
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":944} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":true,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":944,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":true,"countRemainingForInjection":56,"nextBlockCount":254,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":true,"nextCount":1198} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":1000} -->

 <p>
  On level 2 as a Rogue, Jaheira will be Druid 2 - Rogue 2. She will be able to unlock more useful actions at this level, with them being Cunning Action: Hide, Cunning Action: Dash, and Cunning Action: Disengage. All will be very useful in upcoming combat.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":9,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":9,"nbrPlacementsScanned":9,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":198} -->
 <p>
  Finally, as a Rogue, Jaheira will be a Rogue 3 - Druid 2. At this level, Jaheira will be able to pick her Rogue subclass. She has the option between the Thief, the Assassin, and the Trickster. The Thief and Assassin are both great options here, but the main pick will be the Thief here, mainly because of Fast Hands, a subclass feature that Jaheira will unlock immediately that gives her a bonus action. She also unlocks Second Story Work, which gives her resistance to falling damage.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Now, Jaheira should switch back to being a Druid, making her a Druid 3 - Rogue 3. At level 3 as a Druid, she will be able to choose a circle spell. Before that, however, she unlocks level 2 Druid spells. The game gives the player quite a few options, ranging from arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, and Underdark. Now, there is no wrong answer as to which is best, as all can come in handy, but as a recommendation, the player can go with Arctic and Swamp. Jaheira also gets a +1 Natural Recovery charge.

  Moving on to level 4 as a Druid, Jaheira becomes a Druid 4 - Rogue 3. She can unlock an additional Cantrip, with Poison Spray being a valuable option. She also unlocks the Wild Shape Deep Rothe and gets to pick a feat, Magic Initiate: Cleric being a great option as both Cleric and Druid use Wisdom for Magic.

 <p>
  At level 5 as a Druid, making her Druid 5 - Rogue 3, she gets level 3 Druid spell casting and Wild Strike. Wild Strike is an amazing class feature that allows her to make one more attack after making an unarmed attack while in a Wild Shape. From her subclass, she gets to choose level 3 Circle Spells. Good options here are Mountain and Coast. She also gains another extra Natural Recovery Charge.

 <p>
  The next level makes Jaheira a Druid 6 - Rogue 3. At this point, she will get more wild shapes, and these are the Panther and Owlbear. Both of them are amazing wild shapes that will definitely be of use. She also gets from her Subclass Land’s Stride: Difficult Terrain.

  At level 7 as a Druid, making her a Druid 7 - Rogue 3, she gets to choose level 4 spells by picking a terrain type. Here, players can consider either the Arctic or Desert terrains.

  When Jaheira becomes a Druid 8 - Rogue 3, she will just unlock a feat. Warcaster is a good option here.

 <p>
  And, finally, when Jaheira levels up and becomes a Druid 9 - Rogue 3, she will unlock her final features. She will get to choose level 5 circle spells. All terrains here give good spells, but as a recommendation, the Desert and Arctic seem to be the most interesting ones.

  When it comes to making the best build possible, the player must look for items that enhance Jaheira and exploit her potential to its very best. Here are some good options the player can look for:

 <p>
  • Haste Helm. This rare helmet will be found very early on in the game, in the Blighted Village. This helmet grants Smooth Start, which allows the wearer to gain momentum for 3 turns.

 <p>
  • Adamantine Scale Mail. This very rare medium armor will be ideal for Jaheira to wear. This armor will reduce all damage by 1. It will also send back an attacker reeling if they target Jaheira with a melee attack. It will also make it impossible to land critical attacks on Jaheira. However, she also gets disadvantages on stealth checks.

 <p>
  • Glowing Shield. This uncommon shield will add +2 to her armor class. Additionally, if Jaheira’s hit points are below 50%, she can receive an extra 8 temporary hit points after being attacked. This works once a short rest.

 <p>
  • Melf’s First Staff. This uncommon staff will be Jaheira’s main weapon. It deals 1d8 + 1 bludgeoning damage and allows Jaheira to receive a +1 bonus for spell attacks. Additionally, she can also use Melf’s Acid arrow and she can use Topple if using the staff in her main hand.

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft Classic
   </strong>
  </em>
  just revealed a new set of names for the fresh Anniversary Realms, including Dreamscythe, Nightslayer, and Doomhowl for NA players. These improved
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  server names were made in response to fan feedback and will officially open on November 21.

 <p>
  During the recent Warcraft Direct,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  announced a fresh start for
  <em>
   Classic WoW
  </em>
  . These new realms would go through all of Vanilla and into
  <em>
   The Burning Crusade
  </em>
  , implementing some fan-favorite quality-of-life features to the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft Classic
  </em>
  servers as well. However, when it revealed the original servers – Moldar’s Moxie, Fengus’ Ferocity, and Slip’kik’s Savvy – players were not impressed by the names.

 <p>
  Now, it seems Blizzard has heard its fans, and has decided to change the names to options it referred to as “superior.” According to forum posts by
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  community manager Kaivax, the new NA servers will now be called Dreamscythe, Nightslayer, and Doomhowl for normal, PvP, and Hardcore respectively, while AU players have a single PvP server in the form of Maladath. EU fans can choose between Thunderstrike for normal, Spineshatter for PvP, and Soulseeker for Hardcore.

  The

  devs aren’t the only ones who liked these names more. Fan reception to this announcement has been very positive, with nearly every player on both the Alliance and Horde in
  <em>

  agreeing these names are a marked improvement over the first batch. Many also pointed out it was good that the servers in different regions were getting different names, as two servers sharing the same one across the world could get confusing.

  November 21 will also be a big day for Season of Discovery as well.

Considering the Firelands raid came to

   <strong>
    Stellar Blade
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Shift Up has recently been listed on South Korea's stock market after raising the highest capital for a gaming company in the country in nearly three years. The game development studio was founded by
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  director Hyung-Tae Kim in 2013.

 <p>
  The launch of the PS5-exclusive game
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  earlier this year put Shift Up on the map. Receiving countless positive reviews from critics and players alike,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  also sold incredibly well despite only being available on the PS5. The hard-hitting action-adventure title is set in a post-apocalyptic setting and follows the protagonist, Eve, as she attempts to reclaim the planet from a clan of deadly creatures.

 <p>
  As per Bloomberg, Shift Up raised 435 billion won, or $320 million, after going public on Korea Exchange. This is the most money a South Korean firm in the gaming sector has raised since
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  publisher Krafton raised $3.8 billion in August 2021. Overall, it is also the second-largest offering in South Korea this year, following that of HD Hyundai Marine Solution Co., which was worth $553 million.

 <p>
  As part of the IPO, Shift Up sold almost 7.3 million shares, with each share was valued at 60,000 won, or approximately $44. According to the report, a recent filing showed that the demand from investors far exceeded the number of available shares by 226 times. Moreover, the source states that funds from the IPO would be used by the company to "diversify its gaming portfolios."

  Since

 <p>
  Players can expect new features, including a Photo Mode, additional skins, and more, to arrive in the coming months. While
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  has performed incredibly well on PS5, Shift Up is eyeing the release of a
  <em>
   Stellar Blade

  PC port to further increase revenue from the game. Based on Sony's recent strategy, it wouldn't be far-fetched to expect the PS5-exclusive title to eventually get a PC launch a few years down the line.

  Private Division and Weta Workshop's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tales of the Shire
   </em>
  </strong>
  is far from the first farm life sim to breach the surface of the gaming industry, with massively popular titles such as
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  currently dominating the cozy sphere. One would think that
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  's addition to the catalog might be a bit overkill at this point in the game, especially with even more similar titles like ConcernedApe's
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  currently in development. However, despite seemingly including almost everything that makes a cozy farm life sim what it is,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  still has something that others in the genre lack, giving it a major advantage over its competition and arguably allowing it to set a precedent for the future.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  offers plenty of features common to cozy farm life sims — like cooking, farming, foraging, fishing, and home decoration — which seems to make it anything but an original idea. Nevertheless, it is original in one unique way: it is based on
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , an existing IP that previously had no connection whatsoever to the life sim genre of gaming. At the end of the day, this might be its secret weapon and help it rise above the overwhelming sea of games like it, all while inspiring other developers to experiment with existing IPs similarly.

  Tales of the Shire Is an Unexpected Lord of the Rings Adaptation
 </h3>
 <p>
  Adaptations of any kind are a tough nut to crack, as they are often simultaneously criticized for not being faithful enough to their source material and not being original enough to warrant being made in the first place. This is especially true of film or book adaptations, as they have consistently proven just how difficult it is to perfect the formula. J. R. R. Tolkien's
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  is one IP that is not lacking in adaptations, and now
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  joins that extensive library with yet another take on its fantastical world. That being said, it's quite unlike any adaptation before it and comes with a major advantage over others as a result.
 </p>

 <p>
  Most
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  games fall under the action-adventure genre, and rightly so considering the franchise's premise.
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , on the other hand, is a farm life sim in which players live out their life as a Hobbit in the village of Bywater. It is far from what anyone expected out of a
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  game, and a daring move by Private Division and Weta Workshop, but it could potentially help ensure its success. Even if it doesn't earn the praise it undoubtedly aims to garner,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could still set a precedent for the gaming industry.

  Future Games Shouldn't Be Afraid to Experiment in Similar Ways to Tales of the Shire
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ultimately, what
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  accomplishes for the gaming industry is it paves the way for developers to be a bit more experimental and innovative with their games, as opposed to simply conforming to the standard of what's expected. For example, most people likely expect a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game to be an action-adventure title, but a space colonization game based in the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe would break the mold and provide
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  gamers with a different form of gameplay than they're used to.

 <p>
  Whether
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  is as successful as its developer hopes it will be, at the very least, it will serve as an example of what is possible by encouraging other developers to explore outside their comfort zones for new ideas. Early hands-on previews of
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  have shown it to include several features uncommon to the cozy genre, so it may even be a trailblazer in more than one way.

  According to a forum post, the upcoming
  <strong>
   Nvidia
  </strong>
  flagship graphics card, the GeForce RTX 5090, could feature a base processing clock speed of 2.9 GHz and make it the fastest card to hit the market. While Nvidia has not officially revealed the RTX 50 series at the time of writing, the rumored clock speed of the RTX 5090 would make it nearly 700 Mhz more powerful than the RTX 4090.

  Under the Blackwell codename, the GeForce RTX 50 series is the rumored successor to the RTX 40 series lineup. Although no release date for the new generation of Nvidia graphics cards has been announced, that has not stopped social media from spreading rumors about the specifications and size of the upcoming GPUs. In late May, a known industry leaker claimed some prototypes of the GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition took just two expansion slots on a PC case. By comparison, certain models of the RTX 4090 can take up three or four slots and require a GPU bracket to prevent sagging and motherboard damage.

 <p>
  Although rumors must be taken with a fine pinch of salt, a source claimed that the RTX 5090's graphical power would be a game changer. According to Chiphell forum user Panzerlied, the base clock speed of the upcoming RTX 5090 could reach 2.9 GHz, which would put it near 3 GHz out of the box. While their post did not cover any overclocked speeds, the fact that the rumored base speed of the RTX 5090 is potentially 700 MHz higher than the RTX 4090, one of the best graphics cards on the market. Ergo, the rumored GeForce RTX 5090 base clock speed would be 30% more than the RTX 4090. However, the RTX 4090 can be boosted to reach clock speeds around the 2.9 GHz mark, which comes at the cost of additional power.

  While the tech giant remains tight-lipped about the precise specifications of the Blackwell GPU generation, PC users may get an opportunity to learn more later this summer. Nvidia lead Jensen Huang will be a keynote speaker at the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference in Denver. Huang's keynote will take place on Monday, July 29, focusing on AI and graphics.

  With Nvidia already beginning work on GeForce RTX 50 series laptops, the next generation of desktop graphics cards may soon follow. It remains to be seen when Nvidia will pull back the curtain on the RTX 50 series GPUs.

 <p>
  Borderlands 3 has a ton of legendary weapons, shields, grenade mods, artifacts, and class mods that players can farm throughout the game. Sometimes, these legendary items can be hard to find, or in some instances have a hard time spawning.

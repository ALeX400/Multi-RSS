 <p>
  Ibai is known for hosting the amateur boxing event, La Velada Del Año, featuring various internet personalities. When it debuted in 2021, Ibai quickly reached over 1 million concurrent viewers on Twitch and YouTube. He continued to break records with every La Velada Del Año stream, including the most recent edition of the event.

 <p>
  Ibai recently hosted La Velada Del Año 4 on Twitch, which reached a record-breaking 3.7 million concurrent viewers before the main event even started. The event venue was packed as well, which further solidified the success of Ibai and his team. The streamer also managed to break his previous record of 3.5 million concurrent viewers from last year's La Velada Del Año stream.

 <p>
  Apart from popular online influencers battling it out in the ring, La Velada Del Año 4 featured a musical performance by Will Smith, who rapped the
  <em>
   Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
  </em>
  theme song. Ibai posted a clip of the performance while thanking his fans for joining him on his streaming journey. Many people congratulated Ibai on his successful event and for breaking another Twitch viewership record. Twitch also gave him a shoutout on its own Twitter account as well.

 <p>
  Ibai's La Velada Del Año is proof that creator boxing events are still very popular on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. Similar events like iDubbz's Creator Clash and Ludwig's Mogul Chessboxing Championship also pulled in impressive viewership numbers, mostly from fans of the featured streamers and content creators. There's clearly a lot of interest in boxing events as they show another side of internet personalities, and there's also an opportunity to give back if it's a charity event.

 <p>
  Following the success of La Velada Del Año 4, Ibai is likely to become one of the most-watched Twitch streamers again this year. It's even more impressive to see him dominate the top three spots of the most-viewed Twitch streams list thanks to his boxing event, followed by other streamers like TheGrefg and Squeezie. It will be interesting to see if another streamer will be able to beat Ibai's viewership record because he definitely set the bar high on the platform.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  has made a name for itself by blending an open world into a live service gacha game with the intention of portraying a grand journey across the world.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  periodically unveils new nations to explore, along with characters native to these nations for players to pull. While these updates should typically be strictly good news, the reveal of the Natlan region comes with a major caveat.

  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  has been boycotted in the past for one crucial aspect of its character design, and the characters revealed within Natlan so far suggest that this criticism is still being overlooked. Despite the intention of taking players on an international adventure through a variety of regions,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  still features almost zero people of color within its roster of more than eighty characters.

  Genshin Impact's Diversity Should Be Essential
 </h3>
 <p>
  Natlan will be the sixth major nation added to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , and presumably one of the last considering what has been revealed so far about the game's lore. Each nation in the game is purposefully inspired by regions from around the world, and the rich cultures that inhabit them. This makes diversity an inherently essential aspect of the journey players embark on throughout the game.

  Nearly every character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is meant to reflect the cultures of real people, and one cannot stress deeply enough the importance of representing these cultures authentically. Of course, it is always important to show respect to the cultures of others regardless, but
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  bears another responsibility on top of this.

 <p>
  Not only is the game so heavily focused on its international setting, but the massive popularity of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  means its audience is international as well. People play
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  around the globe, and many of these people share heritage with the cultures that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  intends to portray. When players cannot see themselves in characters meant to represent them, it could harm the experience of many and make the other efforts of the game appear inauthentic.

 <p>
  Natlan draws from a few major sources of inspiration. While all details have not been revealed yet, the largest influence on the culture of Natlan seems to come from Latin American and Polynesian cultures, with a few regions that also seem to be inspired by African cultures. Blending unrelated cultures into a homogeneous setting could already be considered problematic, but the issue with character design remains front and center.

 <p>
  Simply put, the cast of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  almost exclusively features characters with light skin tones. This would be noticeable in most games, given the lack of diversity despite the game's sizable cast. However, this issue is made all the more prominent precisely because
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  claims to represent a diverse number of cultures.

  's reveal of Natlan characters has made this more apparent than ever. Only one character is portrayed as non-white, while the rest simply do not reflect the diversity of the cultures they are representing. Even the Archon of Natlan, the God of the region, is one of the most pale characters in the game. Likewise, even the outfits characters are wearing are very inconsistent with their inspirations.

  Genshin Impact's Character Design has Received Criticism Before
 </h3>
 <p>
  Natlan's handling of diversity would already be a large enough issue in a vacuum. However, this is anything but the first time this controversy has surrounded
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . Sumeru is one of the game's previous regions, and it is mainly inspired by nations in the Middle East and Africa. Upon its reveal, Sumeru's roster received the exact same backlash for the exact same reason.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":845} -->

 <p>
  Many of the characters in Sumeru have Arabic names, but only an incredibly small handful of playable characters had skin tones more tan than the vast majority of the cast. Similarly to Natlan, even the Archon of the region did not have black or brown skin. Sumeru has taken meaningful inspiration in aspects such as its architecture and music, but this does not erase or excuse the colorism evident within its character design.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Many hoped that HoYoverse would take this criticism in stride, and learn from fan reactions towards Sumeru. However, seeing as Natlan faces a similar issue with its character designs, many feel that their previous words have not been heard. This has caused the conversation to spark up all over again, with many wondering if even the backlash now will be enough to change minds.

  Genshin Impact's Future Should Not Reflect its Past
 </h3>
 <p>
  Diversity is anything but binary. The options for character design are endless, and even games that feature a more diverse roster sometimes fail to capture the beautiful array of people around the world. The issue of colorism is a delicate and important topic, and the issues present in the character design of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  are also apparent in many other mediums. However, the value of diversity is too important to overlook.

 <p>
  Some may argue that standards are different where HoYoverse is located. However, cultural norms have not yet stopped games like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  from making advancements in other kinds of representation. Titles such as
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  have frequently featured characters implied to be LGBT, which shows that the game is more than capable of achieving this ideal.

 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  features a variety of nations, so it should appropriately reflect the variety of people that exist within those nations. This should be a straightforward principle, but it is unfortunately one that continues to be overlooked. Natlan and Sumeru both faced criticism over the lack of diversity in their character designs, and the pattern this has created is even more concerning than any single incident.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1086} -->

 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  will receive more updates in the future, each with its own new cast of characters. There are plenty of ways for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  to address this ongoing criticism. More importantly, diversity should have already been a key priority for a game that represents the different people around the globe. With that in mind, it is more than understandable for patience to begin wearing thin.

 <p>
  Details about a possible sequel to 2021’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aliens: Fireteam Elite
   </em>
  </strong>
  have supposedly been leaked online, hinting that a new
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  game could be coming next year. Even before
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  , the legendary
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise has spawned numerous video game adaptations over the decades, ranging from tense survival horror titles like
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  to more action-focused shooters like
  <em>
   Aliens: Colonial Marines
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":420} -->
 <p>
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  is more in line with the latter, putting players in control of a squad of Colonial Marines as they embark on a dangerous mission at a distressed space colony 23 years after the events of the original
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  movies. Just like the
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  features different character classes, with players either teaming up with each other or AI-controlled squadmates as they fend off waves of hungry Xenomorphs using customizable skills and weapons. The game was met with average reviews at launch, and
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  ’s player count eventually dwindled after a decent start on Steam.

 <p>
  Rumor has it that a new
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  video game could be in development, with sources claiming it to be a sequel to
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  . Screenshots of a document detailing this supposed game have been spread on social media outlets like Reddit over the weekend, with said game reportedly planned to launch sometime during the third quarter of 2025. Tentatively titled “Project Macondo,” the game will allegedly add new gameplay modes like “Annihilation,” a Xenomorph-filled take on the Horde Mode found in other contemporary shooters.

 <p>
  The leaked document goes on to describe how Project Macondo would set itself apart from the first
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  . According to the information provided, the new game will feature “fixed preset character archetypes and non-customizable characters,” a contrast to
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  ’s weapon customization options, and would supposedly utilize console voice chat applications instead of an in-game voice chat feature. The document also claims that Project Macondo won’t have any of the micro-transactions, loot boxes, or gatcha mechanics that gamers have decried in other titles over the past few years.

 <p>
  It should be pointed out that the document detailing Project Macondo seems to have been produced some time ago, and certain information contained therein might have been changed throughout development - assuming the document itself is authentic. There is currently no official word of a new
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  video game being developed at Cold Iron Studio as of this writing, but if it is indeed set to launch next year then an announcement could happen soon.

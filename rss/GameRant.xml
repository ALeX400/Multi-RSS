  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  player online has made a massive mistake in Whiterun with disastrous consequences, and is made to regret their decision immediately. Despite the consequences, their actions have resulted in what is undeniably a hilarious
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  clip.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a testament to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's quality that gamers are still experiencing hilarious moments in the RPG over 13 years after its original release. Very few games have this kind of staying power, and even fewer still manage to offer up new scenarios that most players will never have seen before. Over the years, it has been interesting to see the kind of situations players find themselves in. For example, one
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  player found a hilarious glitch that saw them be threatened by a fish. Sometimes, these hilarious situations are intentional, while others are the result of bugs. Still, they're funny all the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Redditor Lonely_Valuable9647 was teaching a prospective
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  College of Winterhold student how to cast spells in the middle of Whiterun. As it happens, their decision to indulge the student proved to be a massive mistake. For some reason, the Whiterun guards became hostile to the student, who was considered to be committing a crime. The player was left to watch in horror as the Whiterun guards murdered the student in cold blood, a direct result of their poor decision to allow the lessons to take place.

 </h2>
 <p>
  The student encounter is one of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's random encounters that can occur after the player has learned any Ward spell. However, there were plenty of gamers in the thread claiming to have never met the student for themselves, with one player even claiming to have over 3,000 hours of playtime. It just goes to show how much content vanilla
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  has for players to explore - a massive reason the game remains so popular after all this time.

  While it's cool to see
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  still delivering moments like this, it has been a very long wait for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  . Gamers definitely want to see a new entry in the series, which was first announced back in 2018. Bethesda has been extremely quiet on the project. As of the last
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  development update, the game is in production at the moment, but how far along it is remains to be seen. Hopefully, 2025 will be the year when gamers finally start to get a few concrete details about
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  , although there are certainly no guarantees in this regard.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  producer and director Naoki Yoshida confirmed that two of
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's most anticipated features, Cosmic Exploration and the Shades' Triangle field operation, will begin in Patch 7.2 and subsequent updates. Yoshida confirmed the news during a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  stream titled "A Stroll With Yoshi-P," which was later translated by players.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news came just days after
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  launched Patch 7.16, which brought the final chapter of the
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  Role Quest saga and saw the Warrior of Light take down a villainous Viera, Apyaahi. Despite Patch 7.16 also bringing some PvP balance updates and bug fixes, one small error was uncovered by
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  players during the Role Quest finale. A translation error appeared when speaking to an NPC in Tuliyollal during the
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  Role Quest epilogue, which showed Japanese text on the English game client. Square Enix said the NPC text issue would be addressed in an upcoming
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  game client update.
 </p>
 <p>
  During "A Stroll with Yoshi-P" on January 24, Yoshida stated that some of
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's long-awaited attractions would arrive soon. According to translated notes posted on the r/ffxiv subreddit, Yoshida said the Cosmic Exploration feature for Crafters and Gatherers was on track to launch in Patch 7.2. Yoshida also discussed combat-related updates planned for 7.2 and smaller updates such as Patch 7.25. Along with The Arcadion's Cruiserweight tier of 8-player raids arriving in Patch 7.2, Yoshida said that the first part of the Shades' Triangle field operation, dubbed the Occult Crescent, would go live during Patch 7.2's release cycle. Yoshida teased that Support Jobs, such as ones found in past
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  titles
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  would be utilized in some capacity during the Shades' Triangle field operations.

 </h2>
 <p>
  Yoshida said that players will want to keep an eye on the battle pacing in Patch 7.2, as more things will be shown on the screen that may not show on the buff or debuff tracker of the game's user interface. Yoshida also confirmed that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  will have its seventh Ultimate raid challenge and that the encounter's plan has already been decided. While Yoshida did not divulge what the new Ultimate raid would be, the high-end challenge will likely debut during
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's patch cycle.

  Fans know more than ever about
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom: The Dark Ages
   </strong>
  </em>
  after Xbox Developer Direct, including why the game won't include a multiplayer mode. The upcoming prequel to
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  will take the series in new directions in several ways, including with its single-player-only focus. While some may be disappointed at the break from tradition, the team behind
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  has a reasonable explanation behind the decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many say the original
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  was the first shooter with online multiplayer, or at least the first game to bring it into the mainstream. Considering that legacy, it may strike some as a surprise that id Software is choosing to focus solely on the campaign in their latest entry. As dramatic a departure as it may be, though, it could let the game reach heights the series hasn't been able to in previous titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a Q&amp;A at Xbox's Developer Direct reported by Eurogamer, executive producer Marty Stratton announced
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  will be campaign-only and cited the story mode's sheer size as the reason why.
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  is reportedly the biggest and most in-depth campaign in the
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  series yet, which was made possible by developers focusing all their resources on the campaign rather than diverting time to multiplayer functionality. Players may fight alongside allies in
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  for the first time, but their teammates will be NPCs. In that regard at least, the Doom Slayer is still slaughtering waves of demons all on his own.

  Game director Hugo Martin expanded on how focusing on solo experiences helped push the campaign to new heights.
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  gives players a dragon to ride and a giant mech to pilot, and according to Martin, those are both elements id Software had wanted to include in previous titles but weren't able to partially because of resources going to multiplayer. Removing the need to include multiplayer gives the developers more time and resources to work on the dragon and the mech — a fair trade-off, since
  <em>
   Doom:
  </em>
  <em>
   The Dark Ages
  </em>
  is now poised to bring never-before-seen features to the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the specs are any indication, the effort to push the game to its limits has paid off. The Developer Direct also revealed that at a minimum,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  requires a ray-tracing capable GPU on PC, as well as an 8-core CPU and 16 GB of RAM. It's certainly the biggest, most demanding
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  title to date, even without multiplayer options to consider.

      <title>5 Best Games Starring Demigods, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-games-starring-demigods-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Demigods are the children of gods who are born as a result of their often illicit unions with human beings. The actual heritage of demigods can be somewhat different from simply half-god and half-mortal. Some demigods have divine ancestry on both sides, such as Hercules, who was a maternal descendant of Perseus, in addition to being his half-brother through Zeus. Others earn their title of "god" rather than it being a fact of their birth. They tend to be protagonists in video games revolving around the mythology of their divine parents.

  Demigods are usually very powerful, but the same can also be said of those who mean them harm, whether mortal, monster, or even antagonistic divinity. While gods are commonly classified as invincible, demigods need to work their way up to that distinction (if they are even capable of being called such). Their mixture of otherworldly power combined with an essential human element is part of what makes demigods such popular characters. Here are some of the best video games (and franchises) to feature demigods as prominent playable characters.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  series is, at its core, a crossover between
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  , a pair of games rooted in a mixture of history and mythology surrounding various periods when states in China and Japan, respectively, were at war with one another. Fascinatingly, certain warriors from these periods, such as Guan Yu, a military general and friend of the warlord, Liu Bei, have also been worshipped as gods.
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  takes the figures from these separate eras and puts them in a strange new world where they have to fight each other and eventually other mythological beings, most commonly led by Yamata no Orochi. This typically involves clashing with a number of gods, many of whom eventually deem mortals worthy after a long period of being unconvinced.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate
  </em>
  focuses more on Greek and Norse Mythology when it comes to new antagonists. A prevalent character is Perseus, the demigod son of Zeus and Danaë. Perseus rebels against his father's forces and tends to be a guiding hand to the warriors, forming an especially close bond with Yukimura Sanada. Ultimately, this version of Perseus is revealed to be Loki, the Norse Trickster God, unwillingly serving Odin. In
  <em>
   Ultimate
  </em>
  , this version of Loki defects, discussing his survivor's guilt as he and Perseus were forced to fight one another to the death in a show of loyalty to Odin. Eventually, the warriors are able to resurrect Perseus, who, like Loki, forms a genuine bond with Yukimura. The true Perseus unveils the secret perpetrator behind the madness in the game to be none other than Hades himself, who is collectively beaten by the other warriors after much effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another popular demigod character is Nezha, who, like his father, Li Jing, was recognized as a deity. Nezha was previously an antagonist in
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi 3
  </em>
  , but he grew to respect the power of mortals and now aids them against the new gods. He also has two forms, with one being a cyborg body created for him after the destruction of his mortal body. Yang Jian, more popularly known as Erlang Shen, is also present, and another god with at least partially mortal ancestry. He is known for his roles in the Chinese novels,
  <em>
   Investiture of the Gods
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  . He is a rival and occasional ally of Sun Wukong, a recurring, often antagonistic character in the
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  series.

  The MOBA game
  <em>
   SMITE
  </em>
  (and its recent sequel) stars a number of mythological figures from all over the world. Beyond the commonly explored and adapted mythologies, some are relatively less present in the popular conscious are also adapted here. One of the earliest examples, chronologically speaking, is Gilgamesh, a hero of ancient Mesopotamian Mythology. He is the child of Ninsun, a Sumerian Goddess, and Lugalbanda, the King of Uruk. Gilgamesh is best known as the protagonist of the
  <em>
   Epic of Gilgamesh
  </em>
  , an epic poem that largely details his relationship with Enkindu, with them beginning as enemies but growing into lifelong friends who achieve many exploits together.
  <em>
   SMITE
  </em>
  focuses on the arrogance of Gilgamesh with his apparent desire to become a "full" god.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another demigod in
  <em>
   SMITE
  </em>
  is Cu Chulainn, who is considered a son of the Irish God, Lugh, and also an earthly form of his. He is a fearsome, fatalistic figure who is destined for both greatness and an early grave. Other demigods include Hercules, Erlang Shen, and Achilles.

  Demigods, as they are defined in
  <em>
   Asura's Wrath,

  are significantly different from them as they are conventionally understood. They are an advanced species of humans effectively given some form of "divinity" through the ability to control Mantra, a type of cosmic energy produced by emotions and prayers. The titular character, Asura, is one such being. He seeks vengeance after being betrayed by his allies who killed his wife, framed him for her death, and kidnapped his daughter, which led to him being killed once he tried to rescue her.

 <p>
  His wrath at such injustices leads to him returning to the mortal world and slaughtering all his former allies. He eventually discovers that a being who previously guided him, known as Chakaravartin, is at the root of all the suffering, as the god who endowed others with demigod powers and subsequently orchestrated the conflict Asura participated in along with the rest of their world. Asura kills Chakaravartin after refusing godhood, and he subsequently removes the world's mantra, ending his life. His rescued daughter, Mithra, keeps his name alive by telling his story to humans. He is subsequently reincarnated many years later, alongside his family and former allies, into a world with presumably less significant conflicts.

  Many people know
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , at least by reputation. What is somewhat less known is the fact that there is in fact a mythological character known as Kratos. He is a loyal servant of Zeus who is known for his involvement in the torture of Prometheus. However, he has little directly to do with the protagonist of
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , as his name was merely chosen to mean "strength."
 </p>
 <p>
  The initial
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  trilogy and supplementary games focus on Kratos in the context of Greek Mythology. Having been manipulated by Ares to kill his family, Kratos seeks vengeance on him. He eventually kills Ares and succeeds him as the God of War, but he is still haunted by his past sins. Suffering further betrayals, and the discovery that he is Zeus' son, Kratos goes on a rampage against the Greek pantheon, even temporarily allying with the Titans, before he is betrayed by them as well. After eventually killing the likes of Zeus and Gaia, Kratos is left in a near death state.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since 2018, the series has taken a turn, instead focusing on Kratos' journey into Norse Mythology. Kratos takes another wife, who bears him a son by the name of Atreus. One of the first major goals of Kratos in the 2018
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  is to honor his wife's dying wish to have her ashes spread on the highest mountain in all the realms. This incarnation of the series focuses on Kratos' relationship with his son, Atreus, and his attempts to be a better person, in spite of the conflict that seeks him out. Without delving into spoilers, the story is packed with gods, mythological creatures, and mystical realms.

  The
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  duology is a pair of roguelikes, the second of which,
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , is currently playable in Early Access. Each game features a child of Hades and Persephone. Zagreus, stars in the first game as the son of Hades, who discovers his mother is actually Persephone, the demigod daughter of Demeter. This runs counter to his previous belief that Nyx, the Goddess of Night, was his mother. Zagreus attempts to escape the Underworld to find his mother, but he is met with many challenges along the way, the chief of them being his father. Zagreus is aided by other Olympians, who recognize him as one of their own due to both of his parents' ties — despite some resentment toward Hades.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zagreus is eventually not only able to find his mother and return her to the Underworld but also steadily form a reconciliation between Hades and the other Olympians, helping a few other tragic figures along the way. Sometime later, Persephone and Hades have a second child, a daughter by the name of Melinoë. Unfortunately, a short while after they pose for a family picture, Chronos, the Titan of Time, escapes his prison and takes over the Underworld, banishing most of its residents. This leads to the events of the still developing
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Melinoë never really knew her parents, her brother, or the many friends and relatives Zagreus had encountered during the events of
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  . She was instead raised as a student and an effective surrogate daughter of Hecate, the Goddess of Magic, who teaches her magic and spells. After being raised for many years to become a powerful warrior, Melinoë delves into the Underworld with the goal of defeating Chronos. Her goals take her to the surface, where she eventually travels up to the heights of Mount Olympus to face Prometheus. As
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  is still being developed, her ultimate fate is not yet known, but it will likely be unveiled as the game's development continues.

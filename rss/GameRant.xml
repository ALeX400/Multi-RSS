  Cooking in
  <strong>
   <em>
    New World: Aeternum
   </em>
  </strong>
  has changed a little bit since the earlier stages of Amazon's first MMORPG, and though almost everything looks the same, the interface has changed slightly, and there have been some tweaks to recipes. Both new players and veteran ones will need to learn a thing or two about one of the most useful Trade Skills in the game to make the most out of it.

 <p>
  New World: Aeternum made a few changes to the Cooking system, mostly related to how recipes work, but the mechanic shouldn't be unfamiliar to returning players. To start Cooking, players can use the
  <strong>
   Camp feature
  </strong>
  . For players playing on a PC,
  <strong>
   pressing the Y button on your keyboard
  </strong>
  will be enough. For those using controllers, they will be able to activate a radial menu by holding the
  <strong>
   UP button on their D-pad
  </strong>
  , and from there, select the Camp Feature.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1050} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  That will grant them access to basic recipes such as Rations, Pots, and Bait, which will vary from Tier 1 to 5 depending on their camp level. But to start cooking for real, players will need a Cooking Station, which is
  <strong>
   found in Settlements
  </strong>
  .

    <!-- Zone: instream-incontent. -->
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Cooking Stations start at level 1 and can be developed to a maximum of level 5. This is determined by the rate of growth of the settlement and how much the reigning Guild has invested in Town Projects. When players approach a Cooking Station, they will be able to access the crafting menu by pressing E (on PC), Triangle (PS5), or X (Xbox). The cooking menu will pop up, and players will be able to select the recipes they want to craft right there.

  Scrolling to the sides when selecting recipes will set the amount crafted. The more they craft, the more Cooking Experience points players will receive, and this means they will be able to level up the Trading Skill and unlock new recipes.

     Try to craft as many Tier 1 recipes with basic ingredients (like rations) and then scale from there into Tier 2, 3, and so on. The more players craft, the faster will level up. But to do this, they'll need lots of materials.

  To level up the Cooking trade Skill in New World: Aeternum, players will need to create hundreds of dishes and unlock new recipes. But here's some useful advice and tricks that players can use to overcome the soft caps between Tier 1 and Tier 3 and advance the Trade Skill much faster:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Establish a Decent Farming Route and gather lots of materials before beginning to craft. Several farming routes are good for Tier 1 to 3 materials, we will cover those in some video footage below.
  </li>
  <li>
   Don't leave a single box unchecked. Loot boxes and chests often contain crafting materials. Cooking materials are among those but drop particularly from Provision Crates and Reserves.
  </li>
  <li>
   If money is not a problem, players can also buy ingredients from other players from the Trading Post.
  </li>
  <li>
   Proficiency Boost potions can help players gather even more materials to craft better and more recipes, thus leveling faster.

     Provision Crates are good places to find certain ingredients like Salt, Milk, Rye, Rice, and others. Farms are great places to find produce like fruits and vegetables. Mills will often yield flour and other ingredients to bake bread. Pirate coves, and Caves in general often offer a great amount of ingredient and material crates, so those are also good places to look for these items.

  Once they have gathered enough materials, it will be time for cooking. Start by crafting near 50 Tier 1 Recipes, that will yield enough experience to jump to Tier 2. From there, 100 Tier 2 Recipes will put players on the right path to cooking more dishes and reaching Tier 3.

      Compound Materials

     like pasta using flour and eggs, or spices using herbs. Those will also be good for leveling up cooking. Crafting sausages and other meat derivates, or cheese and other milk derivates is also necessary to fully develop this Trade Skill.

 <p>
  Tier 3 to 5 recipes can be quite challenging and will require intermediate materials, and those can be crafted starting level 20/50 of the Cooking Trade Skill. That's why players need to constantly farm materials, especially salt, sugar, and herbs to make spices, since once they hit Cooking Tier 3, the real fun begins.

 <p>
  By the time they are about intermediate tier 3 (65 Cooking), players will abandon the soft cap the experience becomes harder to get since more and more materials are needed. Players have two choices now: start raiding enemy settlements for extra materials or develop the secondary Trade Skill Fishing. We will discuss that next.

  Fishing, Skinning, and Harvesting will be three Trade Skills players need to level up in order to make the most out of Cooking. Harvesting and Skinning will rise up naturally as players gather materials such as
  <strong>
   Meat
  </strong>
  and forage for
  <strong>
   Berries
  </strong>
  . But fishing requires a little bit of finesse to develop. This mini-game will send the players on a quest to become the best anglers in Aeternum, but to do that, the best place to start is the coast of Windsward, near the right side of Amrine Temple.

  There are two fishing Hotspots there, and players should practice their fishing skills for two important reasons:

   It has a chance to yield treasure chests that contain

  Once the two Hotspots are depleted, players should stick around since they will also be able to get lots of mats from the Pirate Coven nearby. There's plenty of wild game (Turkey, Rabbit, Lynx, etc) to be hunted in the hills up north, and in Amrine Temple (near the northern hills), lots of
  <strong>
   wild vegetables, herbs, and berries
  </strong>
  to Harvest as well.

 <p>
  Another good farming route is the Monarch's Bluff Shores - Hurtfang Hole zone (as seen in one of the first videos), where players will find plenty of Turkeys, Boars, Herbs, and Berries to Harvest. Make sure to skin every animal, since these will provide meat that is a must-have for cooking.

      <title>Why Genshin Impact's New 5.2 Leak is Bad News For Fans of One Character</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/genshin-impact-5-2-leak-no-shenhe-rerun/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Recent leaks claim that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s 5.2 update won’t feature reruns for Shenhe, a 5-Star Cryo Polearm user. If this is true, this would mean that Shenhe currently has the longest waiting period for a rerun banner among any other 5-star characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , which is a notably long list.

 <p>
  Overall,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has been neglecting Cryo characters in the latest updates, with very few Cryo characters getting rerun banners in the past few updates, as well as a lack of new Cryo characters. Not only is this leak bad news for players who want to add Shenhe to their roster or obtain Constellation upgrades for her, but it’s also a problem for players who have been looking to add more Cryo characters to their party in general.

  Shenhe’s last appearance in the Event Wish Banner was over a year ago during

  <em>

  ’s rerun waiting list has always been a cause for concern, with some of the most popular or meta characters often going over a year since their last appearance in the Event Wish Banner. However, a new trend has emerged among
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s character waiting list that has put players in an especially tough position. Not only has Shenhe gone an overly long time without a rerun, but
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  ’s Event Wish Banners are currently going through a drought of Cryo characters in general, leaving players with little to no options for expanding their roster with Cryo characters.

  Snezhnaya is believed to be the region of Cryo, which could potentially bring
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s drought of Cryo characters to an end. However, with the Natlan region’s updates still in progress, it will be a while before the Snezhnaya region updates are released. Even then, there’s no guarantee that Snezhnaya updates will expand the roster with multiple Cryo characters, considering that the Natlan region updates still have yet to introduce any playable Pyro characters. Consequently,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  should consider solving this problem well before the Snezhnaya updates by introducing new Cryo characters soon.

 <p>
  Speaking of, leaks from
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s 5.3 update claim that Citlali, a new 5-star Cryo character, will be featured in the Event Wish Banners. Although it remains to be seen how Citlali compares to the current meta for Cryo characters, adding new Cryo characters would still do a lot toward bringing
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s drought of Cryo characters to an end.

 <p>
  Additionally, some leaks claim that certain Elemental reactions could receive buffs in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s 5.2 update, notably including Cryo Freeze and Shatter Elemental reactions. These buffs may not be enough to make some of the underwhelming Cryo characters able to finally compete with the current meta for Cryo characters, but it will still provide a well-deserved buff for all Cryo characters.

 <p>
  Ultimately, the wait for Shenhe’s rerun banner in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  will likely continue to endure for at least another update, potentially more. However, with the anticipated release of Citlali, a new 5-star Cryo character in the 5.3 update, and buffs for Cryo Elemental reactions in the 5.2 update, this may not bring an end to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s drought of Cryo characters or a rerun of any fan-favorite Cryo characters, but these could still be steps in the right direction.

  features more than 180 characters, so it may seem accurate to say that its developers left no stone unturned. This is largely true, with only very few major sections of the series being left by the wayside. When it comes time to correct those few exclusions,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  should pay extra close attention to its next generation.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  has a difficult relationship with manga content. For one reason or another, directly including characters or story arcs exclusive to the manga seems to be a huge hurdle for developers to clear. However, there are still a number of characters who reference the manga in their movesets. With this in mind,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  's up-and-coming hero duo deserve to join the fray.

  Dragon Ball Super's Anime and Manga Have Plenty of Differences
 </h3>
 <p>
  While many anime series are direct adaptations of their respective manga, this is far from the case for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  . There are a number of differences between both versions of
  <em>
   Super
  </em>
  , especially since the manga continued long after the anime finished airing. Among these many differences, the manga lets Goten and Trunks fill a much more significant role.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":999} -->

 <p>
  As one might expect, Goten and Trunks tend to spend their screentime leaning more on the gag side of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , and less on the action side. Likewise, they're far from the main characters, though the series may eventually move in that direction. In their largest share of relevance yet, Goten and Trunks served as dual protagonists for an entire mini-arc of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  's manga.

 <p>
  This section of the story was widely well-received, thanks to it honing in on the heart of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  . Furthermore, it was meant to help ease the manga into the Super Hero arc. This coincided closely with the release of the
  <em>
   Super Hero
  </em>
  movie, which may suggest something about how fans can set DLC expectations for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  has been on hiatus for quite some time now, and it's still uncertain when the manga might finally return. There's no indication of how the story might end either, though it seems unlikely that Goten and Trunks have recently been propped up for nothing. There is still the issue of
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's ability to adapt manga characters, but the
  <em>
   Super Hero
  </em>
  movie may have deftly evaded this issue.

  Teen Goten and Trunks Could Have a Fighting Chance in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero
  </em>
  stars Gohan and Piccolo in the lead roles, it does feature Goten and Trunks as well. In fact, the duo is depicted in the same Teen redesigns they share with their manga counterparts. This implies that a potential appearance in
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  would consider Teen Goten and Trunks movie characters before it would classify them as manga characters.

 <p>
  There is still one major roadblock standing in the way of Goten and Trunks, and that's their current role as part-time combatants. This could lead some to question whether Teen Goten and Trunks have enough to inspire a moveset off of, but this is pretty easily disproved. Of course, Goten and Trunks are already included in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: S parking Zero
  </em>
  's roster as their younger selves. Furthermore, there are many more characters with much less fighting prowess who have still managed to carve out a unique identity.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1137} -->

 <p>
  Last but not least, Goten and Trunks carry an appeal not shared by any other character. Goten and Trunks are most well known for fusing into Gotenks, a being as overconfident as he is overpowered. Teen Gotenks has yet to show up in peak fighting form, and
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  could generate newfound hype by giving him his debut.

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  were to include these recent versions of Goten and Trunks, it could kill three birds with one stone. Their inclusion would simultaneously embrace the manga, the future of the anime, and potentially even be a sweet dose of fan service. For this reason,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  's next generation seem like perfect candidates for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero

  's DLC.

      <title>5 Best Open-World Games To Play As A Summoner</title>

  Nothing makes an open world game better than its ability to immerse players. In open world fantasy titles, giving players the opportunity to immerse themselves in a magical system with its own rules, limits and benefits is an excellent way to show how much detail the world has accrued.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":286} -->

  Whether the game is a bit sized experience or a sprawling one, magic can turn the gameplay in any title from decent to wondrous. In these games particularly, magic can take on one particularly entertaining form. Even if some of these games don't have an explicit summoner class, they all let players evoke the raw power of a summoner, kicking back their feet and relaxing as otherworldly minions do all the heavy lifting.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a fantastic game that relies on the diversity of its builds to showcase just how many spells and weapons there are. Want to make a build where you lug around the biggest weapon possible? They've got it covered. Want to make something a little more niche, like a sleep build? They've also got that covered. This kind of build diversity is part of what makes exploring the Lands Between so fun and engaging, even on multiple NG+ runs or on entirely new characters.

 <p>
  But one staple among most builds are ash summons, and beyond this, certain spells that briefly summon creatures, like Tibia's Summons. These summoning aspects can be specialized into by using the right equipment, upgrading ashes, and being smart with when these summons are activated.

  The Summoner class is one of many Wilder classes available to the player in
  <em>
   Tales of Maj'Eyal
  </em>
  , with a special emphasis on calling forth creatures of the wilds to do the player's bidding. In particular, there are three distinct branches of skills in this class that focus on specific creatures the player can summon. Melee summons bring forth creatures like wolves and golems to draw foes in and pummel them with physical strength, while ranged builds summon insects and hydras to take foes out from afar, and utility builds have all manner of buff and tank creatures to support their summoner.

  Its in-depth classes like this that make

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
  </em>
  is an incredible game that still holds up today as a fantastic exploration of Tamriel's heartland. While there are many questionable design choices (who took this beautiful Roman Empire-inspired capital and turned it into a generic Tolkien-esque fantasy realm?!), the game retains much of the charm of older
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  games through its retention of classic staples like the class system and the fleshed out schools of magic.

 <p>
  It's very easy to build an entire character around conjuration in this game, letting fearsome Daedroths or mischievous imps do all the fighting while players hang back, maybe taking on a buff spell or two. Creating custom spells that can summon while also buffing the caster is an incredibly cathartic experience in this game.

  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  is a highly engaging, highly moddable title that brings to life a sense of wonder and exploration that few games manage to emulate. Even once players are familiar with the progression and structure of
  <em>
   Terraria,
  </em>
  the game continues to keep people guessing and on their toes through updates and unique changes within every world. It's just a perfect mix of RPG and survival elements, epitomized in the four major classes of melee, ranged, magic and summoning that players can focus on.

  Yes, for players looking to double down on summoning,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  has an entire host of accessories, armors, weapons, and special objects that enhance summonings or allow summoning to occur, giving players a multitude of adorable, pixelly friends to pummel bosses and enemies with.

  As
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  continues to steadily expand on its range of classes, summoning continues to be an integral part to many classes and their builds, especially when specializing down the paths of healers or DPS. The necromancer class has a collection of short lived summons that exist to quickly deal damage, while the warden has sustained melee attacks through their summons, and the powerful sorcerer class can, depending on what branch of summons they've taken, use their daedric creatures to heal or harm - or both in equal measure!

  Summoning is the bedrock of many classes in

  , and with different themes each suiting the classes they're present in - perfect for any
  <em>

  fans looking to conjure some creatures across Tamriel.

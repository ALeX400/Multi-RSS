  The Ice Claw Shield features a cute and playful snow leopard peeking out from a cozy snowdrift. The top of the shield has a snowy rim, adding to the ongoing winter theme in

 <p>
  To get the Ice Claw shield, you need to actively participate in the
  <strong>
   Seal Slide tournament
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   secure the top ranks (1 to 5).
  </strong>
  The Seal Slide leaderboard tournament launched on December 17 and will only be live for almost one day. This means you have 24 hours to give it your all, score the most points, and claim the Ice Claw shield.

  Like all tournaments in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   you can score points in Seal Slide by completing Shutdowns and Bank Heists.
  </strong>
  These minigames are triggered when you land on the Railroads tiles. The default points you earn from each action are given below:

 <p>
  The Seal Slide tournament has 40 milestones, so make sure you complete as many milestones as possible within the 24-hour timeframe to maximize your score and increase your chances of winning.

 <p>
  The trick here is to use a higher dice multiplier in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , which will multiply the points earned. For instance, if you’re rolling with a x50 multiplier, you’ll earn 50 times the base number of points for each Shutdown or Bank Heist you complete. This can significantly boost your overall score in the tournament, helping you secure the top spots and win the Ice Claw shield.

    <p>
     Interestingly, you can also earn points for the ongoing solo event, North Pole Profits, each time you land on the Railroads tiles. Of course, these points also depend on your multiplier.
     <strong>
      So, if you’re rolling with a higher multiplier, you can maximize your points in both the Seal Slide tournament and the North Pole Profits event.

 <p>
  Hideki Kamiya, a video game director who is notoriously inflammatory and controversial on Twitter, voiced his regret for insulting a fan of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Okami
   </strong>
  </em>
  on the social media platform. The original
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  is considered to be one of Capcom's cult classics and passion projects, owing to its unique art style and gameplay. Hideki Kamiya is well-known in the gaming industry for spearheading a number of Capcom's games, including this one. He's also one of the most outspoken directors in the industry, next to
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  producer Katsuhiro Harada, as he isn't afraid to voice his opinion on things or block fans on Twitter who rile him up.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While Kamiya is well-known as the face of Platinum Games, he recently left the studio and came back to Capcom to form Clovers, a successor studio to Clover Studio from 20 years ago. The announcement of this new studio coincided with the announcement of an
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  sequel at the Game Awards 2024. A sequel to
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  was one of the last games viewers expected to be announced, especially fans of the cult classic franchise, as there hasn't been a new entry in the series since 2010's
  <em>
   Okamiden
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Naturally, a lot of
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  fans rejoiced at this announcement, with Hideki Kamiya himself commenting on how he was watching various reaction videos on YouTube. Following the announcement, he made a post on his personal Twitter account (translation courtesy of Automaton), commenting on how he saw a reaction video of someone being overjoyed over the upcoming
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  sequel. However, he thought the YouTuber, Skittzipoo, looked familiar, so Kamiya looked through his previous logs on Twitter. Kamiya realized that she had sent questions to him in the past, and what he did in response was insult her. Kamiya, for his part, expresses great regret, saying "I want to snap my own neck off…"

 <p>
  In a follow-up tweet, Kamiya apologizes to Skittzipoo, saying "I love this person… I'm sorry about before…" Kamiya's well-known on Twitter for being an incredibly outspoken person on the platform. He usually refuses to answer questions that are sent in English, and while some questions are asked in good faith, others are sent to intentionally provoke him, resulting in Kamiya typically blocking said user on Twitter.

 <p>
  Following this comment, the
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  director was asked by fans if he could consider unblocking them from Twitter. In typical Kamiya fashion, he's mostly responded to these requests with a resounding no, calling some people "insects" and asking them to go away if they're going to inundate him with questions that annoy him.

  Catch the
  <strong>
   High Roller
  </strong>
  earlier in the day and use it to score as many points as you can for the top and sidebar events. The best part is that the points earned through all Shutdowns and Bank Heists today will contribute to both the solo event and leaderboard tournament.
  <strong>
   Use this to your advantage and amp up the multiplier in
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
   whenever you’re nearing a Railroads tile.

  January 2025 will be an exciting month for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . The RPG will launch its 3.0 update and transport players to Amphoreus, its fourth explorable world. Even though Version 2.7 isn't halfway done yet,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has already shared an Amphoreus trailer to give players a glimpse at the planet's Greek-inspired architecture. Fans are hoping that Version 3.0 will be
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's biggest update yet, and the patch will likely attract both new and longtime players on all available platforms. Now,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has revealed even more exciting news for PlayStation gamers in particular, as HoYoverse has confirmed the game's physical release date.

  Ahead of the release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sid Meier's Civilization 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Firaxis Games has given fans a detailed look at Harriet Tubman, revealing how she plays in the game. While
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  will not launch until February 11, 2025, this first look at Harriet Tubman’s abilities from the developer could give fans a good idea of whether she is the type of Leader that fits their play style.

 <p>
  One of the major features of
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  is its Leaders system. Thanks to this feature, players can choose a significant historical figure to help direct their empire in the game. The developer has already detailed many Leaders players will be able to choose from in
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , such as Machiavelli, Benjamin Franklin, Charlemagne, and Hatshepsut, and there are more expected to receive the spotlight in the future. Recently, the developer gave players an idea of what to expect from Harriet Tubman, a famous freedom fighter from the United States.

 <p>
  Specifically, Firaxis Games has revealed Harriet Tubman's abilities and attributes, along with sharing a trailer showing some gameplay featuring the character that is coming with the launch of
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  . According to the developer, the character has a specialty for spying, with her Unique Ability, Combahee Raid, reflecting this. This ability, which references her historic raid that freed hundreds of people, gives Harriet Tubman increased influence when starting Espionage actions. A few other bonuses of this Unique Ability include getting additional War Support when war is declared against the Leader and removing movement penalties in Vegetation.

  Besides the Unique Ability, some other parts of Harriet Tubman’s kit highlighted by
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's developer include her Diplomatic and Militaristic attributes, which can be leveled up in the game. In addition, the Leader’s Agenda was revealed to be Veracity, which is related to starting wars. According to the developer, players will receive an increase in Relationship for initiating formal wars, while this value will decrease when starting surprise wars. It is worth pointing out that the character overview also revealed that Harriet Tubman’s map start bias is Vegetated.

  It will be interesting to see what else is revealed for
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  in the weeks leading up to its release on PC and consoles. As part of the festivities at The Game Awards 2024, a cinematic trailer for the game was unveiled, helping to hype up the next installment in the
  <em>
   Civilization

  series. With 26 Leaders reportedly part of the game, it will be interesting to see which others Firaxis Games decides to show off next.

   </em>
  </strong>
  will be crossing over with
  <em>
   The Terminator
  </em>
  for a limited-time event during Season 2. In addition,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players will be able to buy new operator skins based on the original
  <em>
   The Terminator

  movie shortly after the second season begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 2 begins on Tuesday, January 28 with several new content additions to both multiplayer and Zombies. Players can expect new weapons and gear, five new maps, new and returning game modes, and much more over the course of the season, which is expected to last well into March 2025. Season 2's new weapons, weapon blueprints, and Mods may be obtained from new limited-time events, which include Shadow Hunt, St. Patrickâ€™s Day: Clover Craze, and the new crossover event featuring
  <em>
   The Terminator

   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a much grander game than its predecessor,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  . There are a ton of gorgeous vistas, towns, and cities to explore outside Midgar, and if you want to capture a special moment from Cloud's posse, it'll be worth knowing
  <strong>
   how to use the photo mode in
   <em>
    FF7 Rebirth
   </em>
   and take photos with it.

     It's worth noting that the challenges in
     <em>
      Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
     </em>
     that revolve around snapping photos, like the Scenic Spots,
     <strong>
      don't actually require players to take a picture using photo mode
     </strong>
     . You simply need to go to the designated area, stand there, and just open photo mode.

  players can easily open up Photo Mode by pressing the Options button on the DualSense controller to enter the Menu and then hit the Square button.

     If you're using an Xbox controller on a PC, open the menu with the '
     <strong>
      Menu
     </strong>
     ' button and press
     <strong>
      X
     </strong>
     . If you're using a keyboard, hit '
     <strong>
      Esc'
     </strong>
     and then
     <strong>
      G
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Once you hit that button, whatever is happening on-screen at the time will freeze in place, allowing you to move the camera around to position yourself for the best snapshots.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a couple of options for you to tinker with to ensure you utilize Photo Mode properly. For example, you can hold the L2 and R2 buttons (LB and RB on Xbox) to zoom in and out of the scene; you can hide any characters on the field, like Cloud, by tapping the Square button (on PS5) or X button (Xbox) --you can press it again to bring the party back. This is a great option for anyone wanting to maybe take a picture of a landscape or a monster without the party being in the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also use the up and down buttons on the directional pad for further options, which include:
 </p>

 <p>
  If you're on Steam, the screenshot can be taken with F12. You can check out any recordings by going under the View menu and choosing the screenshot option at the bottom of the list.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Doom: The Dark Ages
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to let fans rip and tear through its upcoming outing this Spring. As the third modern entry following the 2016 reboot of developer Id's Software's groundbreaking FPS series and its followup,
  <em>
   Doom: Eternal
  </em>
  in 2020,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  will expand on the deeper story and lore introduced in the previous two titles while continuing to provide fans with the nonstop demon-slaughtering action that is the heart and soul of the franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latest trailer for
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  shown at the recent Xbox Developer Direct delved further into its foreboding medieval sci-fi fantasy setting and the array of armaments that the Doom Slayer will make use of as he joins the Night Sentinels of Argent D'Nur against hell's armies besieging the planet. While it went over some expected territory, highlighting the stunning visual design, crunchy weapons, and other new exciting additions, there was another feature briefly mentioned that will be a major change to
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  's prior designs. It's perhaps a less eye-catching one than others, but no less notable: for the first time,
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  will include a range of accessibility options to let players adjust a variety of parameters and tailor the game experience to their liking.

  Doom Has Previously Kept Things Simple in Its Difficulty and Related Options
 </h3>
 <p>
  Like its core gameplay loops,
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  has often remained fairly uncomplicated regarding its options and settings. This isn't necessarily a negative, but it has long been the norm for the series compared to other games. From
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  's earliest iterations and into recent generations, its most notable choices available were the aptly-named difficulty tiers, ranging from "I'm Too Young to Die" to "Ultra-Nightmare." Each affected standard elements like damage dealt and received, as well as the number and type of enemies that appear. This has served the series well over the years, and
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  looks to be keeping this tradition intact. But it will also be expanding on it by providing a whole other list of items this time around for players to alter as they see fit.

  ' narrative and the brutal new tools of destruction it will include, Id's executive producer Marty Stratton took a moment to explain the scope of other settings beyond difficulties that fans will be able to tweak:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Damage to Player
  </li>
  <li>
   Damage to Demons
  </li>
  <li>
   Enemy Projectile Speed
  </li>
  <li>
   Enemy Aggression
  </li>
  <li>
   Parry Windows
  </li>
  <li>
   Daze Duration
  </li>
  <li>
   Game Speed
  </li>
  <li>
   Resource Values
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  By opening up these other aspects for adjusting,
  <em>
   The Dark Ages
  </em>
  will let gamers find the perfect balance between their skill level, preferences, and play styles. They will now be able to mix and match the above to make things more interesting and/or manageable. For example, players might turn up enemy aggression or damage while also increasing the amount of resources gained, creating combinations that remain tough but fair.
 </p>
 <p>
  This addition also comes with the upside of being more welcoming to newcomers, offering a way of finding their comfort zone to enjoy the experience, while simultaneously letting veterans try their hand at dealing with the extreme ends of the scale. As more games incorporate robust accessibility features,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  making this seemingly minor but still impactful change is an excellent choice that will help the upcoming chapter of the Doom Slayer's journey be more fun and satisfying for all players.

   <strong>
    Ninja Gaiden
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of gaming's oldest franchises, having debuted all the way back in 1988. Originally a 2D action-platformer that launched for arcades and the NES,
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  was a major critical and commercial success, so much so that it received a handful of sequels in the 1990s. After a decade-long hiatus,
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  returned in 2004 with a fairly groundbreaking reboot that transformed the series into a challenging 3D action-adventure. Much like the original
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  , the 2004 reboot received a few sequels, and then the series entered another lengthy hiatus.

  franchise hasn't seen a new release in over a decade. But a spark of hope was reignited at last year's Game Awards with the announcement of

  . And following a surprise appearance at Xbox's Developer Direct, that spark has turned into a fervent flame.

  Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Is a 2D Side-Scrolling Spinoff
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  franchise is about to take 2025 by storm, getting ready to offer two very different experiences that should cater to two different audiences. The first up to bat will be
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound
  </em>
  , set for release in "Summer 2025."
 </p>
 <p>
  Announced at the Game Awards 2024,
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound
  </em>
  will be a pixel art 2D side-scrolling action game that hearkens back to the franchise's 1980/90s roots.
  <em>
   Ragebound
  </em>
  's reveal trailer showed new protagonist Kenji Mozu protecting Hayabusa Village against the demonic horde in Ryu Hayabusa's absence. Coming from The Game Kitchen, the same devs behind the
  <em>
   Blasphemous
  </em>
  duology, fans can expect some fast-paced, crunchy, and responsive side-scrolling combat and platforming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound
  </em>
  's announcement was met with celebration at the end of last year, marking the first new entry in the franchise in over a decade. But
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound
  </em>
  won't need to shoulder all the pressure of a franchise revival alone.

 <p>
  Announced during Xbox's Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames are joining forces once more, this time to create the next mainline installment in the
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  franchise. Simply titled "
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  ," this new entry is currently set to launch sometime in the Fall.

  Despite it only just being announced, quite a lot of gameplay footage and official information has already been revealed about the long-awaited sequel, giving fans a pretty good idea of what they can expect in the Fall.
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  will introduce fans to Yakumo, a new protagonist tasked with clearing the Dark Dragon's "miasma rain" from the skies of Tokyo. To achieve that task, players will be given a bevy of new abilities, from some brutal-looking finishers to the ability to grind on rails and slide down wires. Based on its initial gameplay trailer,
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  looks like an authentic evolution of the series' core formula, and hopefully, it'll be an evolution that was worth waiting 13 years for.

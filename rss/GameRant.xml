  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed its plans for December's Community Day, the last edition of the event in 2024. Community Day is a recurring event on the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  calendar, known for featuring a pocket monster and offering other perks to players. With the end of the year, the augmented reality game takes a trip down memory lane with a special Community Day in December.

  Niantic opened 2024 with Rowlet, Chansey, and Litten as the Community Day Pokemon for January, February, and March. For Grass-type fans, April and May had Bellsprout and Bounsweet, with Goomy, Tynamo, and Popplio in the June, July, and August editions of the event. September's Community Day was special, as it featured Ponyta and its regional variant, followed by Sewaddle and Mankey, which appeared in the October and November events.

  Now,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has revealed the plans for December's Community Day, which will run from December 21-22 from 2 pm to 5 pm local time. Each day, a selection of Pokemon will be available, with Rowlet and five other pocket monsters appearing on December 21. Meanwhile, Ponyta, Galarian Ponyta, and four other critters will appear on December 22. In the final 10 minutes of each hour, Niantic will increase the spawns of Porygon, Cyndaquil, Bagon, and Beldum. As with other
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  events, players can expect bonuses such as double XP and Candy when catching Pokemon, and Lure Modules with extended duration.

  A former Sony head has revealed that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </strong>
  </em>
  was a PlayStation 2 exclusive because of the Xbox. The executive spoke during a recent interview, where he acknowledged that Sony had been concerned about the coming Microsoft console, and that led to three
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games being PS2-exclusive.

 <p>
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  was a massive success, but its overwhelming popularity came as a bit of a surprise to some members of the game development community. Though it was already an established series,
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  dramatically shook up gameplay, switching from a top-down view to third-person, and away from a level-based score system.
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  became one of the best-selling games on the PlayStation 2, and that's due in part to this exclusivity deal.

 <p>
  In a recent interview with GamesIndustry.biz, former PlayStation Europe president Chris Deering spoke about the PlayStation 2 and Sony's concerns over the then up-and-coming Xbox console. In advance of the Xbox's launch, Deering said the company approached a few of its "favorite" third-party publishers and developers with an offer for a two-year exclusivity period. Take-Two was one of these publishers, and it agreed to the deal, locking down its next three games with the PlayStation family of consoles. As a result,
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  all launched on the PlayStation 2 first, remaining solely accessible on PlayStation and PC for the exclusivity period.

  GTA Deal Worked Out Great for PlayStation and Take-Two
 </h2>
 <p>
  As Deering states, the deal was a good one for Take-Two, as the publisher "got a discount on the royalty they paid."
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  likely helped to sell PlayStation 2 consoles, while those who had already bought PS2 consoles were enticed to try
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  as it began to explode in popularity. In the end, the aforementioned
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  trilogy became three of the top five of the PS2's best sellers over the course of its lifespan, with
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  coming in fifth,
  <em>
   GTA: Vice City
  </em>
  in third, and
  <em>
   GTA: San Andreas
  </em>
  in first.

  While the games would eventually be released for the Xbox family of consoles, Xbox gamers had to wait to get their hands on them. Interestingly,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is currently slated to arrive for the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X/S at the same time, but no announcement has been made for a
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  PC release. It will almost surely reach that platform eventually, but for the moment, gamers have to wait and see when that will happen. While the PlayStation and Xbox family of systems continue to compete with each other, there's practically no doubt that both consoles will see a massive influx of sales once the game finally launches on their platforms.

  Spider-Man can never seem to catch a break. This absolute icon from the Marvel Universe is constantly involved in shenanigans and heroics that flex his great power and great responsibility, to the point where his web is constantly stretched across an entire Multiverse. Now, it seems as if
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the latest universe to call upon Spidey's help... again.

  Spider-Man rejoins
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , and players already have an abundance of Wall-Crawlers to choose from. Whether it's Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacey, or even MCU variants. However, the latest Spider-Man x
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collab brings
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  skins
  <em>
  </em>
  into the game, and here's how players can get their hands on the ever-popular Spider-Punk, Spider-Man Noir, and Peter B. Parker.

  Spider-Punk was highly regarded in
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  , and it seems that years after his strong impression with fans, he has come to the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  scene. Spider-Punk doesn't usually play by the rules, but this arachnid anarchist is going to have a blast with the varying methods to win in Battle Royale. Spider-Punk is easily one of the best
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins ever made due to how his art style translates so perfectly into the game, complete with his alternating color outlines that makes him so iconic. The reason Spider-Punk costs 1,800 V-Bucks isn't just for the great skin, but he also comes with a masked LEGO variant, Hobie's Amp Back Bling, and Hobie's Wicked Electric Guitar to use in
  <em>
   Fortnite Festival
  </em>
  .

  Spider-Noir left quite an impression on fans with his appearance in
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  . Not only is this iconic hero played by the one and only Nicolas Cage, but his dazzling and hardened art style from the pulp noir of the 1930s makes for a great skin, and a likely candidate for the try-hards out there who like to use dark skins for shadowy areas. Spider-Man Noir can be purchased for 1,500 V-Bucks, and it comes with a LEGO variant and the Spider-Man Noir's Satchel Back Bling.

  Peter B. Parker joins the Spider-Gang in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , handing in most of his iconic spandex to relish in his new responsibility as a dad. This Spider-Man variant comes with a fuzzy pink bathrobe and a pair of slippers to make for a comfortable outfit that might not be the most suitable for the heroics that await in Battle Royale. While most fans of the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  movies might be a tad disappointed that the art style isn't used here to bring a full-suited and booted Spider-Man to the game, it's still nice to see Peter B. join the family. Those who purchase Peter B. Parker will also receive Mayday's Diaper Bag as a Back Bling, and a LEGO variant of Peter B. Parker for
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  modes.

  Players who just can't decide on a favorite
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  character to take into Battle Royale can grab the Spider-Gang Bundle. This is a great deal for those who love the three characters of Spider-Punk, Peter B. Parker and Spider-Man Noir, as it packages all three of them, along with their Bundle items and other cosmetics, for just 3,800 V-Bucks instead of the separate price of 6,400 V-Bucks. Here's a look at all the items in the Spider-Gang Bundle:

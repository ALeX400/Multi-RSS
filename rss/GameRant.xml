 <p>
  Horror and sci-fi are a match made in heaven or, more appropriately, hell. For as much as sci-fi is about exploring, it is specifically about exploring the unknown, something the horror genre thrives on. The medium of video games only serves to enhance this, putting the player firmly in the driver's seat and letting them explore each game at their own pace, often putting the horrors right in front of them.

 <p>
  The longer length of video games means that themes can be explored more thoroughly and thoughtfully—themes such as hubris, humanity, and playing god, key staples shared by both genres. Another additional benefit is that players can directly interact with the futuristic technology in the games, creating a deep sense of immersion; making the upcoming scares all the more terrifying.

  Another brilliant immersive sim from Arkane (the studio behind
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  ),
  <em>
   <strong>
    Prey
   </strong>
  </em>
  involves Morgan Yu exploring the space station Talos I during an attack by an alien force known as the Typhoon. Players familiar with the genre will be right at home, looking for door codes and solving environmental puzzles in creative and inventive ways. The mysterious Typhoon will naturally stalk the player and attack them with various powers and those not paying full attention will be caught unawares.

 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Prey’s
  </em>
  central mechanics allows Morgan to be upgraded with various skills, including those of the Typhoon. Players can beat the aliens at their own game, however, they may risk being listed as a threat by the station's security measures. It also won't protect them from mimics, which makes the player question every object they come across, as an unnoticed mug may suddenly jump out and attack them.

 <p>
  Based on the short story of the same name,
  <em>
   <strong>
    I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a point-and-click horror game where five protagonists, the last humans on Earth, are forced to face grueling, personalized trials after being tortured for 109 years. This is orchestrated by AM, a god-like sentient supercomputer, who does this because he hates humanity.

 <p>
  The player has to navigate each character through each scenario where they solve classic point-and-click puzzles. The kicker is that it is completely possible, and easy, to fail; the game is difficult without any sort of walkthrough. While this sounds frustrating, it only adds to the pure horror of hopelessness, making it a sci-fi horror classic. The game was even co-authored by the original writer, Harlan Ellison, who expanded on his original story. He also lent his voice to AM, creating a meta-context in the narrative where the player is effectively going up against the god of the story.

  Horror and comedy have often been said to be two sides of the same coin and nothing proves this more than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lethal Company
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It’s hilarious to watch a team member get eaten by an eyeless dog because they breathed too hard into their microphones by accident. It is significantly less funny when it happens to the player.

 <p>
  Players will work in a team to scour various moons for scrap to sell whilst avoiding various monsters including, but not limited to, the stealthy Braken, the Weeping Angel-esque Coil Heads, and pools of sentient slime. If players do not meet a quota before a deadline lest they face severe consequences from the company…

  While the recent remake of the first game made a very archaic game much easier to play,
  <em>
   <strong>
    System Shock 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a much more refined and more important video game going on to inspire
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Prey
  </em>
  plus various other immersive sims. Going back and playing the game shows off mechanics that would become a staple in the genre, such as superpowers in the form of psi powers, excellent open-level design, and RPG leveling.

 <p>
  Its horror comes from the eeriness of the empty space station where no one else seems to be alive save for many of the abominations that have to be fought, and SHODAN's return speech is just as memorable all these years later.

  In 1979, the film,
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  cemented itself as one of the most tense and gorgeous looking sci-fi films of all time, so it's only natural that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien: Isolation
   </em>
  </strong>
  would do the same but in the medium of video games. Putting them in the shoes of Amanda Ripley, players will search the Sevastopol Space Station for Ellen Ripley’s flight recording. Aesthetically, the game looks just like movies, having that iconic retro-futuristic theme that feels cold and corporate, creating a sense of dread.

 <p>
  Players will definitely feel vulnerable exploring Sevastopol with little more than the franchise's iconic motion tracker, beeping faster and faster, warning them of their imminent demise at the hands of the titular alien, or it could just be another human. Either way, careful consideration must be taken as even the smallest sound can be detected, leading to a quick death if players don’t react appropriately. To make matters worse, the Xenomorph learns as the game progresses, keeping its bag of tricks fresh.

  Trading the first game’s space setting for an ocean one, the sequel to
  <em>
   Stasis
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stasis: Bone Totem
   </em>
  </strong>
  goes for a slower-paced point-and-click experience rather than full-on combat like some of its contemporaries. Despite this, it's still very macabre, perhaps even more so, many of the challenging puzzles have a gruesome twist, sometimes involving investigating cadavers or potentially killing the player if they fail severely.

  In terms of narrative, two salvagers, Charlie and Mac, and their late daughter’s seemingly sentient super-toy, Mosses, come across an abandoned oil rig ripe for salvaging, but they soon discover some things were better left submerged as they discover the horrifying events that transpired while having their family ties tested.

  What makes it so compelling is its presentation(intentionally similar to classic 3D survival horror from the 5th console generation) and its story. A story that explores themes of dreams, the self, and identity, all wrapped in Lovecraftian-style horror. It’s classic sci-fi through and through.

  If there was an award for “Worst Day At Work”, engineer Isaac Clark would win it by a mile. The protagonist of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead Space
   </strong>
  </em>
  goes through some truly awful stuff on the USG Ishimura, a mining vessel during an emergency mission. Players will have to navigate the ship's various nooks and crannies, fighting off necromorphs using various engineering tools at their disposal, all in the hopes of finding a way to escape the horrors of the ship.

 <p>
  What makes
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  stand out as a sci-fi horror is the fact that the world the characters inhabit feels truly natural and fleshed out. Even without the monsters, it's still exciting to see the various pieces of future tech, such as the kinetic module or the engineering suits Issac dons throughout the game. This technology even plays into the user interface as it is all diegetic, creating a great sense of immersion. The 2023 remake only serves to improve the overall experience offering better zero-gravity gameplay and better audio among other things.

  <em>
   Winter Soldier
  </em>
  is one of the strongest Duelists in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with an aggressive chasing and grappling kit that impairs the movement of his foes and a powerful execution ability that can be spammed to wipe out an entire team. He is moderately difficult to master but fun to play, and it feels rewarding when getting the hang of his kit.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Roterstern
   </strong>
   - Primary Attack: Winter Soldier aims and shoots his faithful revolver, dealing great damage at moderate range (40 m). Can do precision damage (headshots) and needs to reload every three shots. But, thanks to its passive, each time Winter Soldier uses a skill, this will refill the magazine automatically.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Kraken Impact
   </strong>
   - Ultimate Attack: Winter Soldier jumps into the air and smashes the ground, dealing damage in an AoE and marking all targets with "Culling," which makes them be automatically executed upon reaching 20% Health. Killing Marked enemies resets Kraken Impact for a re-cast and can be spammed as long as Winter Soldier kills marked enemies. Enemies that are at 20% or lower will be immediately executed by the initial impact.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Trooper's Fist
   </strong>
   - Winter Soldier dashes in the aiming direction and pushes back the enemies, then propels them into the air for a brief instant, making them vulnerable to all attacks.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Tainted Voltage
   </strong>
   - Shoots an orb of electricity from his fist that slows down foes, making them vulnerable to combos. It also makes flying targets (such as Iron Man and Storm) fall to the ground.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Bionic Hook
   </strong>
   -
   <strong>
   </strong>
   Fires a Grappling Hook that penetrates rivals, grabbing enemies in a straight line and pulling them toward Winter Soldier. Enemies hiding behind their allies are also reeled in.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ceaseless Charge
   </strong>
   - Passive: Each time Winter Soldier uses an ability, his bionic arm automatically loads Roterstern and grants bonus Health to Winter Soldier.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Infinite Grit
   </strong>
   - Team-Up Passive: When Rocket Raccoon is in the same team, he can throw a power up station that makes Winter Soldier's Roterstern increase its fire rate and have infinite ammo. Getting out of the AoE provided by this support skill will cease the effect after 0.5 seconds.
  </li>

  Winter Soldier is a combo-based Duelist that shifts from mid-range attacks to powerful chasing and crowd-control abilities in a matter of seconds. Any Winter Soldier that is left unattended for long can wipe out an entire team, and with his powerful execution ultimate (
  <strong>
   Kraken Impact
  </strong>
  ), he can basically chain combos and kill enemies endlessly. If the team is struggling to deal with pesky foes like Scarlet Witch, there's no better chaser than him.

  He is a great initiator, but a lousy brawler, so having him take the lead during battle is not a good idea.

  Winter Soldier is a

   side-initiator, flanker, and chaser
  </strong>
  , so naturally, he is going to be playing near the frontlines next to Melee Duelists and Vanguards. His kit is filled with lots of crowd control and creates incredible synergies with many heroes like Punisher, Captain America, Storm, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Groot, Jeff, Loki, and Thor.

  Having Winter Soldier playing as a mid-range marksman is useful for certain tactics and specific team goals like escorting the payload in Convoy or defending an area in Domination, but his kit is more
  <strong>
   optimized to grab, chase, and destroy rivals
  </strong>
  . So, with this in mind, let's analyze how to play Winter Soldier in each of the game modes of Marvel Rivals.

  , Winter Soldier plays a fundamental role that is flanking opponents, chasing down Strategists (Healers), and destroying annoying targets such as Jeff The Land Shark (or the most annoying of them all: Luna Snow). Have Winter Soldier tailgate opponents that are trying to flank the team, and associate with fast Duelists like Spider-Man, Iron Fist, or Hawkeye to pin down flying opponents like Storm, Iron Man, and Moon Knight (who doesn't fly but falls with style — still annoying). Remember to
  <strong>

  , always prioritize healers first, then ranged Duelists. Winter Soldier will be an easy target if he is cornered by many rivals, so the best approach here is to use Trooper's Fist to either pick up Healing stations (by dashing toward them) or make Winter Soldier retreat to a more secure area. Dash and grab isolated targets, or stick near the Strategists to prevent melee duelists from overwhelming them, but keep an eye out for Iron Fist and Wolverine as they're Winter Soldier's natural counters. If Winter Soldier is near Punisher and Rocket Raccoon, he will become nearly unstoppable, so having these three in a team is a recipe for a win.

  Domination Mode Winter Soldier Tips
 </h3>
 <p>
  Domination basically consists of taking zones, moving from one zone to the next and retaining them until they reach 100% completion. The team that captures two zones is the winner, and Winter Soldier is the key to a fast victory. By pinning down opponents, or isolating squishier targets like Black Widow, Hawkeye, or the agile Psylocke, this hero proves that he has what it needs to be a great team player. Having Winter Soldier outflanking foes, harassing their healers and supports, and creating mayhem by unleashing the Kraken Impact (pun intended) at the right time can shift the balance toward victory in a finger snap.

  Just remember not to overextend attacks or become isolated. Winter Soldier might be equipped with a self-heal passive (
  <strong>
   Infinite Grit),

  , Winter Soldier doesn't benefit too much from over preparation; he is more of a spontaneous, combo-based assault hero (all in one) and will lead the charge when needed — or rotate when there's a problem in the backline. Most of the time, he's a great defense for the back line, since enemies prefer to target healers first for obvious reasons. So, in Defense Mode, make sure to rotate often between the mid line (behind the Vanguards) and the backline (next to Strategists) and protect the latter from being isolated by the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Fist, Psylocke, Cloak &amp; Dagger, or Namor.

Remember that Tainted Voltage also causes flying enemies to fall (Storm, Iron Man, Moon Knight, and Spider-Man, for example), and a well placed skillshot can make the difference and turn the tides when most needed. Finally, Kraken Impact is a great way to execute targets; follow the team and activate when someone drops near 20% HP, this will create a combo sequence that can be infinitely chained and lead the team to victory.

  Winter Soldier can be annoying, but he is not invulnerable, nor a difficult target to overwhelm. The most basic strategy to counter him in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is to
  <strong>

When he has Kraken Impact ready, simply flee, as engaging him is like courting death. Plus, he can execute and re-cast his ultimate endlessly, so a misstep can become a team wipe.

All the melee Duelists associated with him will benefit from his powerful crowd control kit, so isolate him and then destroy the rest of the team.

Using Magneto or Penni Parker, lead the frontal assault and make them concentrate fire on these targets, while sharpshooters like Black Widow or Hawkeye kill Rocket or Punisher.

  The best team composition to play with Winter Soldier in Marvel Rivals has
  <strong>
   Rocket Raccoon
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Punisher
  </strong>
  working together with this former Hydra Assassin. Rocket's deployable abilities can buff both Punisher and Winter Soldier at the same time, empowering their attack, making them shoot faster, and providing infinite ammo. When combining this with Winter Soldier's powerful CC and Punisher's own deployable, the trio becomes a true menace.

 <p>
  To make this even more powerful, having
  <strong>
   Groot
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Jeff the Land Shark
  </strong>
  in the team, and a healer like
  <strong>
   Mantis
  </strong>
  will surely cause a powerful synergy, since Rocket can climb on Groot's shoulders and become nearly untargetable, while Jeff protects Mantis from Duelists. Together, these heroes can win battles like crazy, especially when taking over or defending objective areas.

  If you chose to give the Ward Sensors to Richter during the "Behind Seven Seals" quest, your path through "Answers Come at a Price" will take you through the

  Star reveals that
  <strong>
   Nestor has taken refuge in the basement of a nearby factory
  </strong>
  . However, the factory is now under Ward control, and you’ll need to be careful if you want more information on Nestor. Star also informs you that a few of his men are trapped inside the factory. He’ll request you to rescue his men, triggering a side mission called
  <strong>
   "The Road to Salvation”
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . Completing this side quest rewards you with the PSZ-7 Military Body Armor, so don’t skip it.

 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Fight your way through
   </strong>
   the guards, taking down every soldier in your path. This approach is more direct but will cost you valuable ammo and medical supplies in
   <em>
    Stalker 2
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Opt for a quieter route and slip past the guards undetected. The
   <strong>
    stealth route
   </strong>
   may take longer, but it’s safer and more efficient. Make sure to save your progress frequently when taking this path.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1163} -->

 <p>
  If you’re taking the stealth route, start by heading to the back of the facility. Look for a small hole in the wall on the southwest corner of the factory. Crouch and squeeze through it, and you’ll spot another hole in the building on the left.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Enter through the hole, turn left, and quickly go down the stairs before the guards above spot you. Carefully turn around the corner and use your silenced pistol or knife to eliminate the nearby guards without raising an alarm. Now that you’re inside the factory, the next objective is to find the lab.

 <p>
  The term "Soulslike" has been thrown around a lot lately, perhaps too much, as more and more games borrow elements of FromSoftware's signature formula without wholly devoting themselves to it. However, there are several, very specific features a game must possess to be a true Soulslike, so it's not as common as it may seem.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of gaming's latest titles to be called a Soulslike by many onlookers, but it may not have what it takes to live up to the label.

 <p>
  Since Soulslikes make up a sub-genre of the action RPG space, it can be difficult to discern the differences between the two at times. In light of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's technical classification as an action RPG and its constant comparisons to the Soulslike genre, it's worth examining which aspects of the game cause it to lean more toward the action RPG spectrum and which might justify its unofficial categorization as a true Soulslike game.

  Black Myth: Wukong's Combat Is Fast-Paced and Frantic
 </h3>
 <p>
  Judging by just a few minutes of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's gameplay, it's easy to see that its combat requires non-stop dodges and frequent attacks from the player if they hope to emerge victorious. For the most part, traditional Soulslike games aren't known for having combat that moves this rapidly and, instead, generally demand a more patient and methodical approach from the player to prevent their stamina bar from draining and leaving them vulnerable. It is possible for the Destined One to run out of stamina in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , but it's hardly ever enough to completely disable him and it recharges rather quickly.

 <p>
  <em>

  's progression is one of the more prominent characteristics that set it apart from Soulslike games. Whereas it's possible for players to permanently lose any "experience" they've earned by dying twice before retrieving it,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  allows players to retain their experience and any Sparks (skill points) they've earned regardless of how many times they die. They do, however, permanently lose any medicine they might use before dying, which makes the use of rare medicine almost not worth it at times.

  should think again.
  <em>

  's boss fights are some of the toughest in gaming, which is largely why it has been regularly referred to as a Soulslike. In fact, some of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's boss fights are absurdly difficult, with enemies having a massive library of skills and attack patterns to draw from, steepening the learning curve for those fights by a significant degree.

 <p>
  Another feature of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  that generally leads to other games being classified as a Soulslike is its enemy respawn mechanics. As it is with any true Soulslike game, when players rest to recover their health at a Keeper's Shrine in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , all the enemies in the world will respawn, meaning players should be strategic with their rest periods.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  may have some of the most defining characteristics of the Soulslike genre, but, at the end of the day, it is an action RPG through and through. The Soulslike genre is very strict with its set of rules, and if any of those rules are broken by a game, that game may lose its chance of being properly classified as a Soulslike. Even so,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is just as difficult as a Soulslike game should be, so the tendency some have to refer to it as such makes perfect sense.

  Following yesterday's announcement that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </strong>
  </em>
  would be coming to PlayStation 5, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is elaborating on the decision, stating that it was business-oriented. Many Xbox fans expressed disappointment over this move, believing that the spring 2025 launch of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  on PS5 would likely impact the game's success on Xbox consoles.

  Earlier this year, Xbox revealed plans to port four games from its first-party back catalog to rival platforms Nintendo and PlayStation, namely
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pentiment
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  . At the time, Spencer cautioned players against expecting every Xbox game to go multiplatform, noting that there weren't any immediate plans for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  to show up on PlayStation. After the June Xbox Games Showcase, however, it was revealed that
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  would release day and date on PS5 alongside Xbox and PC in 2025, and Spencer later confirmed more multiplatform ports in the future as well.

  After another brief but heated bout of rumors, Xbox announced at the recent Gamescom 2024 Opening Night Live event that
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  would make its way to PS5 a few months after its December 2024 release on Xbox Series X/S and PC. This came as a shock to some Xbox fans, as the game has been marketed as an Xbox console exclusive. When asked about
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  coming to PS5 in an interview during the Gamescom livestream, Spencer said that Xbox's franchises and player counts "are as strong as they've ever been," but ultimately, he has to "run a business" since the bar for Xbox is "high" at Microsoft in terms of return on investment.

 <p>
  Spencer further stated that he is looking at ways to make Xbox games "as strong as possible" and for the platform to consistently "grow on console, PC and cloud." The multiplatform strategy apparently "works" for the company to help achieve these goals, according to Spencer. He capped off his statement by asserting that game distribution has begun to change amid pressure from shareholders for constant business growth, but the impetus still lies on building "great games," and doing otherwise means focusing "on the wrong things." Spencer's comments clearly show that Xbox's multiplatform pivot is paying off, which was evident when
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  topped PlayStation sales charts some time ago.

 <p>
  It can also be surmised from Spencer's remarks that the decision to bring
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  to PS5 was likely made by Microsoft rather than license holder Disney, as some theorized. Even after this interview, though, the extent of Xbox's multiplatform plans remains unclear, along with whether they could affect console hardware in the long run. For now, Microsoft is working on a next-generation Xbox console, but beyond that, the future is difficult to predict.

  During this week’s Gamescom Opening Night Live, Tarsier Studios pulled back the curtain on its newest IP,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reanimal
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with a trailer dripping in grotesque animal body horror. Developed by the team behind the much-beloved
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 2,
  </em>
  the
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  ’s announcement trailer revealed the title to be another survival-horror platformer. Tarsier Studios had teased the title for some time, leading many fans to anticipate its reveal at Gamescom. Many were likely expecting the teases to accompany a title that departed from the norm. However,
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  is
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  in all but name, and that's great.

  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  is a cooperative survival-horror platformer that pits players against a range of grotesque and horrifying monsters. During its reveal trailer, its co-protagonists, a brother and sister, can be seen fleeing from all manner of dangers, solving puzzles, and traversing unique environments. While the trailer was slim in story details, it more than made up for it in atmosphere and gameplay. However, many of its core mechanics likely appeared familiar to fans of Tarsier Studios’ flagship IP,
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  , which seemingly boasts a similar gameplay loop.

  Viewers of Gamescom Opening Night Live would be forgiven for mistaking
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  for a new
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  title, as the two appear very similar from a gameplay perspective. Had it not been for a new
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 3
  </em>
  trailer later that night, and the fact that Reanimal has its own name, the misconception could have endured. The title’s reveal trailer boasted similar visuals, environments, enemies, and ambiance to the beloved franchise, and its cryptic spoken dialogue left fans questioning what exactly they were witnessing. What’s more,
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  ’s co-protagonists and major mechanics appear to be taken directly from
  <em>
   Little Nightmare
  </em>
  ’s proven formula.

  <em>
   Reanimal’

  s level design, objectives, and mechanics are likely shared with

  . The brother and sister protagonists run, hide, and sneak their way through a variety of corridors, evading malformed and mutated enemies. No puzzles were depicted in
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  ’s reveal trailer, but it's safe to assume players will come across similar pressure and combat puzzles as those found in the
  <em>

  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  did stand out from

  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  may feature
  <em>
   Little Nightmares'
  </em>
  defining features, but its world, enemies, and narrative are something entirely different. The game's official summary, which can be found on Steam and other platforms, sheds light on just how different its vision of horror is set to be. Going so far as to outrightly compare
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 2
  </em>
  , Tarsier Studios states that the title is a darker, more terrifying journey than they’ve ever delivered before.
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  follows a brother and sister as they go through hell to rescue friends scattered across their island home, before escaping its horrors together. What exactly has happened to fill this island with horrifying sheep monsters and deformed human-like creatures remains unknown, but fans are sure to encounter far worse when the title officially launches.

 <p>
  It's great that
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  is essentially a darker
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  . The franchise has proven itself to be an excellent survival-horror platformer, amassing a loyal fanbase. With
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 3,
  </em>
  the studio set to continue the series' complex mythos while maintaining its cutesy appeal.
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  offers the developers the chance to deliver a more mature and graphic take on
  <em>
   Little Nightmares'
  </em>
  formula, without altering their flagship IP.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reanimal
   </em>
  </strong>
  is currently without a release window, meaning fans may have to wait a while before the title's other key differences surface. Until then, fans of Tarsier Studios' unique approach to horror can look forward to
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 3
  </em>
  , which is set to release in 2025.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has become defined by its post-launch seasons in recent years, with the IP's iconic multiplayer experience being almost unrecognizable from its historic foundations. Like most massively popular multiplayer franchises,
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  has leaned heavily into the live-service post-launch approach to its annual releases, with in-game seasons and battle passes offering an endless loop of content in the way of cosmetics alongside the release of new maps, weapons, and game modes.

 <p>
  While the upcoming
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has won a lot of fans over with its focus on returning to the franchise's roots, the title will still maintain the seasonal in-game content approach of more recent
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  titles, and a clear pattern is beginning to form in terms of how Activision handles the final seasons of these annual releases.
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  recently announced the content for one of its last seasons, for example, and the focus on
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  villains that these final seasons tend to have is a tradition that is very likely to extend to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

  In the past, the core multiplayer experiences of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  releases were essentially entirely removed from the single-player narratives of the games, but this is something that has changed with the new seasonal approach that defines the franchise. New in-game seasons often come with fully-fledged cinematics that follow a story that supplements the campaign of a given title, with fan-favorite
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  characters often appearing and bridging the gap between the franchise's two biggest modes.

 <p>
  Throughout the recent
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  reboot, characters like Ghost, Soap, and Captain Price have appeared extensively in multiplayer seasons, with multiplayer operator skins for Frank Woods already being marketed as pre-release bonus content for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . The upcoming game will have a mix of familiar and brand-new faces to pull from in its seasonal multiplayer content, but it seems likely that Activision will wait for the game's final seasons to pull the trigger on involving iconic
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  villains in its core multiplayer.

 <p>
  This is a trend that was first made noticeable with 2021's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Vanguard
  </em>
  , with the game surprisingly introducing an all-star villain cast from a wide variety of
  <em>
   CoD

  Modern Warfare 3 Bided its Time To Focus on a Big Franchise Villain
 </h3>
 <p>
  The recently launched Season 5 of
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  is potentially the penultimate season of the title, and this fresh wave of content has a surprising focus on Valeria Garza, one of the main villains of 2022's
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  . Valeria was first introduced to
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  multiplayer as a
  <em>
   Warzone 2.0
  </em>
  operative in early 2023, only receving a handful of premium cosmetics ever since. It is clear that Valeria is going to be a huge focus of
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  's Season 5, however, with the season's battle pass featuring four unique skins for her,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  may save this approach for its own final seasons.

 <p>
  It is currently unclear who the main antagonist of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's story will be, with a popular theory currently pointing towards Russel Adler skirting the line between ally and villain within the game. This could mean that the multiplayer storyline of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  might culminate with a return of Adler as a big focus, while the main villain of the game's Zombies mode, Edward Richtofen, could also be a big draw of these final seasons. While it would not canonically make sense within the timeline of
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  , a younger Raul Menendez could also be a big content factor in
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  's final seasons, with the sub-franchise having a great stock of iconic villains to continue the
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>

   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer Gameloft has recently acknowledged that some players are unable to access the game due to running into “Initialization Error 6.” The glitch appears to be connected to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s Dapper Delights update, which has recently been released.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s new Dapper Delights update, Gameloft introduced a new Star Path, Tiana from
  <em>
   The Princess and the Frog
  </em>
  as a new character, Tiana’s Palace, and unveiled the final act of the game’s paid DLC,
  <em>
   A Rift in Time
  </em>
  . Aside from that, it also fixed several
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  bugs, but it seems that the patch may have caused a game-breaking glitch.

  Soon after the update was released, some gamers started to experience “Initialization Error 6” while trying to play
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , essentially being prevented from accessing the game. Gameloft was quick to respond on social media, clarifying that the issue was affecting people who updated the game while having the Reflection of China House Style as their primary house. Gameloft apologized for the problem and promised to resolve the issue as soon as possible. In the comments of Gameloft’s post, it was possible to see multiple gamers complaining about other glitches such as Tiana disappearing after being unlocked, so it’s likely that Gameloft will correct these bugs with a hotfix soon.

  While the new update caused a few issues, Dapper Delights has also fixed some previous problems. Not only have over 30 glitches and issues with quests been fixed, but Gameloft also fixed a major pet peeve of the
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  community. Now, Belle’s character model has been reworked, overhauling her previously criticized appearance.

  2024 still has plenty in store for
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  fans. A few weeks ago, Gameloft unveiled a roadmap for
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , detailing some of the content that will appear in the future. Some of the new content includes Timon and Pumbaa being added as new characters,
  <em>
   The Lion King
  </em>
  ’s Realm, Sally from
  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  being teased as a new character, and more.

 <p>
  At the time of the roadmap’s announcement, Gameloft also teased a helpful upgrade for
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  that will likely be available sometime later in 2024. According to the developer,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  players will get increased space and freedom to decorate their Valleys in the future. The upcoming feature was not thoroughly detailed, though, and it’s unclear how it’ll work, but some fans have theorized that players may receive a fully customizable one-off plot of land.

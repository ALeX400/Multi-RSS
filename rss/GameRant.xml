 <p>
  Ever since games like
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  revolutionized the shooter genre, many companies have delved into the world of making immersive stories in which the player must gun down many enemies while experiencing a lengthy and fun campaign.

    Updated July 7, 2023, by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   The First Descendant has just been released, and the free-to-play third-person shooter will likely keep a lot of people busy for a long time. Still, if someone is craving a different type of
   <strong>
    lengthy shooter game
   </strong>
   , they should check the below games. Galleries have been added for most of the entries, and a unique third-person shooter with an unconventional campaign has been introduced.

  B.J. Blazkowicz against thousands of evil Nazis: same old stuff, right? Well, in this reboot of the series, the story jumps ahead many years and shows an alternate history where the Nazi regime won World War 2 and took over the world.

  With gameplay that distinguishes itself perfectly from the new
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  games, id Software and Bethesda hit it out of the park with this game and its sequel by giving a scenario in which the player will have no qualms with eradicating the enemies. Amazing visuals combined with a rich story lead to
  <em>
   The New Order
  </em>
  being the reboot that the series needed, particularly after the lukewarm 2009 outing.

  Insomniac's
  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  trilogy peaked with its first entry, perhaps explaining the franchise's short lifespan. The PS3's best launch title,
  <em>
   Resistance: Fall of Man
  </em>
  matches tight first-person shooter mechanics with an ambitious storyline that guides players across a devasted United Kingdom.

 <p>
  Along with solid multiplayer,
  <em>
   Resistance: Fall of Man
  </em>
  's single-player campaign is fantastic. Packed with memorable set pieces and enemies that are at least somewhat competent, Insomniac put together a great shooter that makes every second of its story count. Even in 2021, this game is well worth playing.

  The best place to start this series is with the original entry. While Columbia is breathtaking at times in
  <em>
   BioShock: Infinite
  </em>
  , there is just something both horrifying and enchanting when experiencing the underwater city of Rapture for the first time. Everything looks beautiful, but the player knows that something is not right in the city.

 <p>
  Mixing superpowers and gunplay together,
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  is an amazing start to the series that keeps players engaged from beginning to end. The mystery, the look of the world, and the gameplay mix so well to create an unforgettable experience.

 <p>
  Despite its sequel adding some RPG elements and extra side content, 2013's
  <em>
   Shadow Warrior
  </em>
  has comfortably the more substantial main campaign. A reboot of the 1997 classic shooter, Flying Wild Hog's release combines an acquired sense of humor with satisfying melee combat and a respectable arsenal of weapons to create a fun throwback to old-school shooters.

 <p>
  An argument can certainly be made that
  <em>

  Valve's genre-defining first-person shooter set a benchmark in gaming that few have been able to surpass. 2004's
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  moved away from the original's confined setting, as Gordon Freeman went on a cross-country expedition filled with plot reveals, inspired weaponry, and wonky vehicles.

 <p>
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  's road trip-esque structure and persistent desire to evolve keeps the game constantly feeling fresh, even if the gameplay cannot be seen as anything more than decent in this day and age.
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  is considered a classic for a reason.

  A love letter to spy shows and movies from the 1960s,
  <em>
   The Operative: No One Lives Forever
  </em>
  is a classic that deserves to stand alongside the likes of
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  . Along with its highly regarded sequel and the
  <em>
   Blood
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   No One Lives Forever
  </em>
  helped put Monolith Productions on the map.

  These spy shooters have aged quite well since they combine solid gunplay with fun gadgets, memorable soundtracks, and engaging storylines packed with unforgettable characters, particularly the charming lead, Cate Archer.

  Arguably the greatest side-scrolling shooter franchise of all time is also responsible for one of the best FPS trilogies ever.
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  is actually the shortest of the three titles, but since the games build upon each other, the original 2002 release deserves to be highlighted alongside
  <em>
   Echoes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Corruption
  </em>
  . It is also available on the Nintendo Switch, making it accessible to newcomers to the series. That said, they are all fantastic.

 <p>
  Despite the change in perspective,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  still has all the hallmarks of a classic Metroidvania: power-ups that open new areas, puzzles, and tight controls. The game nails its gunplay too, both in the GameCube iteration and the Switch remaster.

  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  has very few "mediocre" games, and most of the franchise's entries are designed with replayability in mind. Therefore, the average time of a single playthrough is not necessarily representative of the full package since most of the fun comes from trying the missions on higher difficulties. That said, when viewed in isolation,
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  has a particularly long campaign by the license's standards.

  Building on 2016's brilliant
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Eternal
  </em>
  does not settle for just more of the same. Id Software took a few risks by expanding the Doom Slayer's movement arsenal, a decision that was somewhat polarizing.
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  is punishingly difficult, and the player will need to constantly be on point if they want any hope of surviving. This intensity makes the 15-hour campaign fly by while also ensuring that each moment matters.

  Combining 2004's
  <em>
   Painkiller
  </em>
  with its
  <em>
   Battle Out of Hell
  </em>
  expansion,
  <em>
   Hell Wars
  </em>
  follows Daniel Garner through a blood-soaked war against Lucifer's forces. Featuring more than 20 stages spread over five chapters,
  <em>
   Painkiller: Hell Wars
  </em>
  is a chaotic first-person shooter that harbors back to classic '90s games like
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Blood
  </em>
  .

  <em>

  is a very straightforward shooter, one that appreciates carnage with every fiber of its being. The stages are diverse enough to keep things from growing stale, while the gunplay is gratifying.

  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Call of Juarez
  </em>
  , and
  <em>

  , Techland has firmly cemented itself as a respectable name in the shooter genre. One of the studio's earliest successes was 2003's

  was quite a unique game when it was first released since it favored open levels over corridors and prioritized precision in its gunplay. Although Techland's game has aged quite a bit over the years,

  is still impressive almost two decades following its debut.

  Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  franchise presents globetrotting adventures reminiscent of the likes of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  . As presumably the final entry in Nathan Drake's tale,
  <em>
   Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
  </em>
  delivers the most substantial storyline yet, both in terms of quantity and quality.

  Almost twice as long as the rest of the entries in the series,
  <em>
   Uncharted 4
  </em>
  desperately aims to be regarded as an epic adventure. And, for the most part, it succeeds. While the shooting galleries are still among the weakest elements of this title,

  's gunplay is considerably better than that of its predecessors.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  has spent the best part of two decades jumping back and forth between pure action and survival horror. 2005's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  blended the two genres together to near perfection, and its 2023 remake retained most of the elements that made the original title such a seminal release. Similar to 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake, which is also nothing short of fantastic, Capcom opted against merely retreading the exact same ground as before when crafting this modern update.

  While not wildly different from its predecessor, the remake implements enough changes to freshen up the campaign for veterans who have already played through Leon's adventure multiple times. For the most part,
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  plays like a conventional third-person shooter, albeit a slower-paced one than most modern releases; however, the release also showcases the license's survival horror roots through its horrifying and aggressive enemies. The game is difficult while still remaining fair.

  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  is quickly fading into oblivion. As of November 2023, the game is struggling to reach 200 concurrent players on Steam, which screams "failure" for a live-service project. At least, that would be the case if
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  was a standard example of the genre, but that is not really the truth. A confusing pre-launch promotion cycle muddled the audience's expectations of the game, resulting in a fairly linear shooter being held to the continuous development standards of titles like
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  should be treated as a single-player or co-op experience with a reasonably lengthy campaign. If someone enjoys that ride, they can look forward to some post-game content.

  For all its flaws, People Can Fly's game is a decent third-person shooter with RPG elements that allow for build variety. While it arguably does not succeed completely,
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  tries to tell a satisfying story teeming with world-building. Nowadays, the game cannot be recommended as a multiplayer experience outside of streaming platforms like PS Plus Extra, but it could hit the spot for people looking for a third-person shooter to play solo.

  Soulslikes exist in their own subgenre, and they predominantly lean into action RPG territory.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  fits this standard mold to an extent, all the while changing a few things to set it apart from the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Lies of Ps
  </em>
  of the world. For one, it is primarily a third-person shooter, a choice that few Soulslikes have made and even fewer have executed well. While melee is an option, it is largely limited to a single class; consequently, most
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  players will do battle from a distance.

 <p>
  Expanding on
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  ' many good ideas, the sequel is bigger and better in nearly every way. Split into realms, the game regularly flings players into fresh worlds that are completely different from each other, and that's not even taking into account the fact they utilize procedural-generation technology. The classes are unique and offer a fairly wide range of build options, allowing players to craft an experience that suits them. More importantly, the gunplay is sharp, responsive, and awesome.

  Debuting in the early 2000s,
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force
  </em>
  embraces the allure of B-movie schlock, arguably doing it better than any other video game franchise on the market. Generally, the games boil down to killing wave after wave of insect-esque aliens, with the fifth numbered entry offering more than a hundred single-player missions.

  The gunplay is satisfying but not especially deep, giving an arcade-type feel to the minute-by-minute action. However,
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force 5

  complements its combat with a great class system, a substantial selection of weapons, and enemies that require some thought to defeat.

  Arrowhead's
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is a peculiar case as an argument could be made the game has no campaign, at least not a conventional one. Basically, players are brave soldiers who are tasked with the important operation of spreading democracy across the galaxy, one bullet and explosion at a time. While missions do have variety, most can be summarized as "go to a world, kill anything that moves, get out, and celebrate." It is a simple concept that mostly pushes traditional storytelling to the side, and players can easily ignore everything and just focus on the satisfying gameplay loop.

 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  still has a campaign, even if it might not be typical for a shooter. The developers are constantly evolving the narrative depending on the playerbase's actions, resulting in a clever example of emergent storytelling that greatly extends the game's period of relevancy beyond anything a linear story could have provided. Just to be clear, the story beats are not extremely complex, but they provide some context and drive to the player's actions.

       and take the elevator to reach the rafters. There, you will find a ladder that will take you to the top level. Here, you will find the Wrath from Afar Incantation, which you can loot and then jump to the next part of the rafters and take the ladders again. Active the elevators here, but don't use it. As it goes up, another will come down, and you can jump onto it. You are then face-to-face with this Spirit Ash.

  Hefty Cracked Pots are found in various places in the Realm Of Shadow. Unlike other consumable crafting materials, these

   pots are reused after being thrown

  . Should players use a Hefty Fire Pot, the now empty Hefty Cracked Pot will return to the player's inventory to be filled up again. Players will only need a few Hefty Cracked Pots to cycle through, making the other crafting materials the more important ones to stock up on.

  A lucky
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  player managed to gain the full Black Knight set of armor from one single enemy. This is quite a feat in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , as the percentage of a single piece of loot being dropped is already low to begin with, and getting multiple is even rarer.

 <p>
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Black Knight Armor set was recently added to the game via the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion. The armor itself can be earned by beating the Black Knights roaming the map, mostly in Messmer Soldier camps. While it is some of the earliest loot that can be collected within the DLC, the enemies that hold it can prove to be a tough challenge for those starting in the new area. And while getting a piece from the set of armor upon killing a Black Knight is quite common, scoring the whole set in one swoop requires absurd luck.

  Reddit user cammdog1515 shared a screenshot of the moment where they acquired the full Black Knight Armor in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This included the Black Knight Helm, Armor, Gauntlet, Greaves, and some bonus Smithing Stones to boot. The user mentioned that they had 55 Arcane as a stat. Those familiar with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Arcane stat know that higher points mean more chance for loot discovery and drops, but even then, many in the comments section joked that the user had just spent all their luck for the year.

  Elden Ring Fan Calculates How Impressive The Black Knight Loot Drop is

 <p>
  One comment even stated that they could only achieve this feat when they would enable their cheat engine. Another user replied that most items have between a 2.28% to 4.52% chance of dropping individually. This meant that the chances of getting all six of the items are within 0.0000000113% to 0.000000813% of loot drops. Granted, these numbers pertain to regular items. No one has actually been able to provide the specific rates for the Black Knight Armor yet. And while there are many other ways to possibly increase the drop rate in
  <em>
   Elden RIng
  </em>
  , this moment is likely one of the rarest instances of loot drops to ever happen in the game.

  As

  has only been out for over a week, it's too early to tell if these percentages will be altered. Some fans from the comments section suggested that the user had cheated their way into getting the items. However, cammdog1515 was quick to shoot those down by confirming that they had played on Xbox, thereby negating the possibility of using cheats. Nonetheless, most of the community shared the user's joy and promptly wished them well.

  FromSoftware's games have always featured character customization prominently, with a main focus being on players deciding what stats they want to allocate in order to create different builds.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no different, with various stats for players to invest in. One of these stats is
  <strong>
   Intelligence
  </strong>
  , which is essential for a magic-focused playstyle. Numerous weapons relating this stat can be found throughout the Lands Between.

  continued this, with even more magic-aligned weapons for players to find and equip. Naturally, some are better than others, and some are more prominent. Some are weapons that the player will use to physically deal damage to enemies, while others are catalysts through which the Tarnished can conduct magic to harm foes.

  It doesn't have much range, given it is a fist weapon. However, it can achieve a respectable C in intelligence scaling via upgrading, proving somewhat useful for magic builds. On top of that, the Ash of War lets the player put enemies to sleep, and the following attack can deal bonus damage to foes who are sleeping.

  Throughout
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  , players who wanted to cast both sorceries and incantations had to wield two separate weapons to do so: a staff, and a seal.

   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  introduced the
  <strong>
   Staff of the Great Beyond
  </strong>
  , a weapon that allows players to use sorceries and incantations via one weapon. However, the Tarnished must go through a quest to obtain it.

  The

  However, it can still be a viable weapon. It may not be as good, but it is still able to reach a

  when upgraded and infused as a magic weapon. The damage can still be worthwhile as well, just not as overpowered as it once was.

  Katanas have always been a popular piece of weaponry to use in FromSoft's games, usually being strong ways to deal damage.
  <em>
   Elden Ring's

  base game was no different.
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree

  introduced even more katanas, one of which is the

  This weapon isn't the best in Intelligence scaling, but it does have a strong Ash of War that plows through enemies (and it's magic-themed). The Ash of War has multiple combos that can continue as long as players have stamina, and the weapon can work well on a spellblade build.

  The

   Smithscript Axe

  was once the strongest weapon for Intelligence builds in

 <p>
  However, it isn't an incapable weapon. It can still be a valuable armament to defeat enemies with, but it won't reach the peak it was able to. It is able to reach a
  <strong>
   C in Intelligence scaling
  </strong>
  when upgraded and infused as a magic or cold weapon, reaching a higher attack rating when magic-infused. If anyone is willing to revert their
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  updates back, then this weapon will be waiting in all its glory.

  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree

  introduced completely new weapon types, with thrusting shields being one such example. The
  <strong>
   Carian Thrusting Shield
  </strong>
  is one of these new weapons, and can be purposed for intelligence builds.

 <p>
  As standard, it is suited for Strength and Dexterity players, but infused as a cold weapon, and it achieves a C in Intelligence scaling. Better yet,
  <strong>
   when infused as a magic weapon, it obtains a B in in Intelligence scaling
  </strong>
  . Aside from the scaling, it can be a strong weapon, able to deal damage and block attacks. Players can also buff this weapon with spells and greases, increasing how powerful it can be.

  Rellana is one of the more prominent bosses introduced in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , barring direct access to Scadu Altus. Being magic-themed herself, her Remembrance allows players to obtain her swords, which scale with Intelligence, along with Strength, Dexterity, and Faith.

 <p>
  As a pair of swords, players attack with both through graceful patterns, making it a fun weapon to use in general. The Ash of War is unique, essentially being a two-for-one. Players can either send out a combo of magic-aligned ranged attacks via a sword, or execute a big faith-based AoE attack, sending fire out from around them, easily defeating groups of enemies.

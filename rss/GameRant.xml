   <em>
    Rune Slayer
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers players a huge world to explore. However, while most locations can be found fairly easily, others require wandering through dark forests. So, this guide will tell you how to find the Spider Cave in
  <em>

 <p>
  The Spider Cave is one of the must-see places in this
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game. This is because, in addition to farming spiders and the Mother Spider boss, you can get rare resources here, such as Silver. But first, of course, you will need to find the entrance, which is quite difficult to do if you do not know where to look.

  All the caves in
  <em>
   Rune Slayer
  </em>
  have one thing in common; namely, well-hidden entrances. Whether it's a Slime Cave or a Spider Cave, they're hard to find even if you run right past them. Fortunately, the spiders did a good job and left a web on the way to the cave. To find the Spider Cave in
  <em>
   Rune Slayer
  </em>
  , you need to
  <strong>
   move northeast from Wayshire
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It's important to note that your path goes through spawn points for dangerous creatures. In addition, the spiders in Spider Cave are strong, and if you visit this place having a low level, you'll be killed right at the entrance. If you're confident in your abilities, follow these steps to reach the Spider Cave:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   First, exit Wayshire via the northern exit and follow the path.
  </li>
  <li>
   When it turns, you should continue to go north and enter
   <strong>
    Greatwood Forest
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   After that, go a little northeast until you find
   <strong>
    Ashenshire
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   From here, you should go straight east to a high cliff.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, go around it on the right side to find rocks covered in cobwebs, which will mean you are on the right path.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will have to go a little further to the east, and you will find the entrance to the Spider Cave in
   <em>
    Rune Slayer
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ol>

  The most valuable thing that the Spider Cave in
  <em>
   Rune Slayer
  </em>
  can offer you is
  <strong>
   Silver
  </strong>
  . It can be
  <strong>
   mined exclusively in this location
  </strong>
  if you have a pickaxe. Also, players will find
  <strong>
   spider eggs
  </strong>
  here that require a sickle to collect. Finally, at the deepest level of the cave, you can fight the
  <strong>
   Mother Spider boss
  </strong>
  for a valuable drop.

  In the history of gaming consoles, few have been as influential as the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
  </strong>
  . Nintendo's greatest break into the mainstream of the gaming world was a breeding ground for beloved franchises that still exist today and laid the foundations for entire genres without which modern games would be unthinkable.
 </p>
 <p>
  From absolute classic games regularly regarded as the best of all time to underappreciated classics that laid the foundations of modern genres, there are plenty of
  <strong>
   influential games that defined the NES.

  Capcom emerged early as one of the main competitors to Nintendo development studios, making its own cadre of characters to try and compete for market share both in Japan and the English-speaking world. While many Capcom titles didn't quite capture the imagination,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mega Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  certainly did and is regarded as one of the best games ever made to this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Famous for its unforgiving difficulty and flexible level-select screen that allows players to chart their own way through the game's insidious stages, the game rewards patience and skill and has clear influence over the brutal difficulty design that would come to define Japanese-focused platformers in the 1990s, and it's still a great entry point into the franchise to this day.

  Very few expected
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metroid
   </strong>
  </em>
  to be considered canon as a broadly experimental game that bucked the trends of video game design at the time. Far from plug-and-play,
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  rewarded players for consistent exploration, mapping, and dungeoneering. Most importantly, it also introduced the idea of semi-open worlds where new abilities can unlock previously shut-off pathways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Needless to say,
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  became one of the key parts of the nascent Metroidvania genre that would dominate the indie game world of the 2010s, even spreading into the AAA gaming world too. It's an incredibly satisfying playstyle, making
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  one of the most influential games on the NES, even if it remains one of the most difficult entries in the franchise.

  Western audiences, to this day, may still consider
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  to be the biggest JRPG franchise, but in actuality,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest
   </em>
  </strong>
  is so massive in Japan that it far outweighs the cultural impact of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  . The game was one of the earliest attempts to translate the
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  game system into video games for Japanese audiences, and it was a massive hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  What resulted was a franchise that is still going strong to this day, pioneering the silent RPG protagonist, the number crunching, the light-hearted adventuring, and the distinct style of JPRG that stretches for hundreds of hours. It's hard to imagine what JRPGs today would look like without
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  to inspire them.

  As the popular story goes, in the late 1980s, Square was in big financial trouble, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  was, as the name indicates, their final attempt to revive the company and keep it healthy. Regardless of how true that story is, Square still exists today (now known as Square Enix), as does the indelible influence of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Where
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  broadly popularized the JRPG in Japan,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  is almost certainly the first JPRG played by decades worth of gamers dipping their toes into a whole new side of one of gaming's greatest genres, helped along by the game's relatively humble playtime. To this day,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  evolves further, inspiring more, and becoming the de facto entry point for newcomers to the JRPG genre.

  For a game defined by its simplicity, it's no wonder that mountains of ink have been spilt trying to encapsulate its totemic nature. The simple game of dropping blocks from a height into interlocking patterns has delighted gamers for decades because of its literal game design perfection.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no superfluous design in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tetris
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Every pixel is perfectly placed, every block is considered, and every speed is measured within an inch of its life.
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is a game design icon because it demonstrates how simplicity in game design doesn't mean boring, but instead, can make a game immortal.

  Horror games were not popular in the nascent days of the video game industry for many reasons, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castlevania
   </strong>
  </em>
  not only partially pioneered the subgenre of Metroidvania games, but it also showed the immense influence horror would have over the video games of the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Paired with genuinely impressive visuals and atmosphere for the time, as well as satisfyingly crunchy combat,
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  showed that platformers of the day could branch out further than sci-fi and military settings, setting the groundwork for many horror games to come.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </strong>
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the greatest video game franchises ever made, and it all started here with the original, released in 1986, with the specific intention of trying to replicate the experience of exploring the countryside as a kid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though its gameplay has aged considerably since its release, its game design tenets of relatively open exploration, dungeon crawling, and item acquisition throughout an epic adventure were key in defining where most games would go in the future. It's hard to imagine what action-adventure games would look like today without
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda,
  </em>
  and it's pretty short, too, making it a great game to try today.

  What is there to say that hasn't already been said about
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Bros.?
   </strong>
   It's
  </em>
  quite possibly the most famous game of all time and likely the most famous game there will ever be. It's a game that launched Nintendo into superstardom and continues to pull in millions of fans every year, even if it's not the best
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game on the NES.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the game might not seem impressive to modern gamers, the simplicity of the momentum-based movement, the side-scrolling platforming, the interconnected levels, the speed of traversal, the engaging enemy design, and countless other choices can be seen in almost any game released today. Video games are impossible to imagine without the influence of
  <em>

  Nature photography is a great hobby that can cover anything from animals to plants to fungi to natural landscapes. Virtual photography is a great hobby for gamers, allowing them to take amazing photographs within the worlds of their favorite video games. This goes beyond simply taking screenshots. Photo modes have become an increasingly popular feature in modern games, even if there are still franchises that resist it. Games about photography, like
  <em>
   Beyond Good
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Evil or Life is Strange
  </em>
  , have existed for decades, but this isn't the same thing. Virtual photography is an art form that allows players to get creative with the in-game world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it's not the central focus, a lot of games nowadays love to present detailed environments for the player to explore. Many of them are at least partially set in natural environments, be it desert, forest, jungle, grassland, ocean, or some combination thereof. For some people, this can be a chance to take photographs in places they could never reach in real life. Such detailed worlds often come with impressive models of plants and animals. The following games offer great opportunities for nature photographers who want to take a shot in the virtual space.

    Avowed Is Too Pretty To Not Have A Photo Mode
   </h5>
   <p class="display-card-excerpt">
    One of the most disappointing things in modern gaming is when a pretty game ships without Photo Mode as a feature. It's such a shame that a pretty game like Avowed doesn't let players HUD-less photos of its gorgeous scenery without having to manually turn UI elements off and on again.

  This might seem like an odd choice, but the franchise actually fits quite easily, especially in the most recent entries. One of the things
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  is known for is its detailed reconstructions of historical settings. In the later games especially, that means a lot of detail goes into the environment, including wildlife native to the setting. Starting with
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  , every game has had a photo mode. This means they all include a great range of options for taking pictures, sometimes in settings a player could never hope to reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it's the Egyptian deserts of
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  or the Mediterranean islands in
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  , all of them go to great lengths to portray different types of wildlife.
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  in particular is notable, since its nautical setting allows for detailed underwater maps in addition to the impressive surface locations. Players might have to hunt or defend themselves against some of the creatures, but that's only in the main campaign. In the Discovery Tour mode, that's not a problem, as it allows players to freely explore the map and take photos of anything they want without danger.

  This impressive indie title focuses on low-pressure exploration of a marine ecosystem. Over the course of its short campaign, players step into the shoes of a diver named Mirai, who live-streams while documenting ocean life and promoting conservation. The overall gameplay is designed to be easy to handle. Mirai is well-equipped, so she doesn't have to worry about oxygen, but she does get to encounter a variety of sea creatures. There's even a cool level where she gets to go into the deep ocean and explore some of its more bizarre and unsettling wildlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best part is that the game has a photo mode. This makes it not only a great opportunity to learn about different types of sea creatures, but also to engage in virtual photography of wildlife that might not be available to a lot of land-based photographers. This is a chance to take cool pictures of whales, fish, octopuses — all things that require an underwater specialist to photograph in real life.

  If any virtual photography was going to happen in
  <em>
   Flight Simulator
  </em>
  , one would think it would involve pictures of the various airplanes, helicopters, and hot air balloons available to the player. However, the latest entry added a
  <strong>
   walkaround
  </strong>
  mode where the player can step out of their vehicle and explore their impressively detailed surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can mean walking around an airport or a city, but players can also check out natural environments around the world. African grasslands, snowy mountains, tropical jungles, and the Australian outback are all choices, and each one is populated with native plants and animals. There are even photo missions which issue challenges for players to visit specific biomes and use the photo mode to take wildlife shots according to various parameters.

  Sucker Punch's 2020 game is a gripping story about the flaws in the rigid Samurai code and the question of how one acts honorably against dishonorable enemies. But what doesn't get as much attention is
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's open world, which puts a lot of emphasis on natural environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  The range of animals isn't as wide as in some of the other games on this list, but the ones that appear look amazing. One of the game's mechanics involves following foxes and birds to hidden secrets. Jin can also encounter crabs, bears, deer, fish, and crabs. But it's easy to forget that "nature" isn't exclusive to the animal kingdom. The game boasts gorgeous forests and meadows full of colorful flowers, offering a great opportunity to photograph an extremely scenic environment.

  . With the theme of nature reclaiming the old world, there are also a lot of overgrown ruins where plants have started to take over. This gives the player lots of great landscape opportunities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game also has its share of animals, and even the animal-like machines make interesting photographic subjects. There is a certain peculiarity to the sight of machines that seem to resemble animals navigating what otherwise seems to be a natural world, and they come in a lot of different shapes and sizes.

  As great as a lot of games on this list are, many of them can be intense. Some players might want a calmer, more relaxed experience where they can explore without getting attacked by outlaws or robots. And some might be interested in a game that simulates the experience of real-life photography, rather than just using a photo mode. In that case, a good choice would be Matt Newell's upcoming indie game
  <em>
   Lushfoil Photographer Simulator
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This game is a walking simulator where the player can explore various environments around the world and take pictures with an in-game camera, rather than using a photo mode. It even incorporates the choices a professional photographer would have to make, like exposure, contrast, white balance settings, and even a basic editor. There are no combat mechanics or puzzles to get in the way. Players just walk around a beautifully rendered setting full of plants and animals that will make excellent pictures.

  Wildlife doesn't have to be limited to creatures found on Earth. Unfortunately, until we find a planet with confirmed alien life and a reliable means of getting there, real-life photography of alien fauna is impossible. For virtual photography, on the other hand, there are some options. Plenty of games feature alien ecosystems, but so far none have been able to match the range in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The game's procedural generation system allows the player to keep traveling to new worlds and finding new ecosystems with their own unique wildlife, perfect for capturing with the game's excellent photo mode. All sorts of alien creatures can pop up on different planets. There are even options for diving into alien oceans and taking pictures of marine ecosystems.

  Rockstar's gorgeous open world comes with an almost ridiculous amount of detail. The game takes place on a large map with a variety of extremely detailed environments, and there's only one truly urban location. There are small towns and farms, but a lot of the map is open country and various natural environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the course of the story, protagonist Arthur Morgan encounters meadows, forests, cajun swamps, and (albeit briefly) a tropical island. Except that last one, all of these can be visited at any time. And, of course, Rockstar couldn't render such beautiful environments without offering creatures of the American Frontier, from squirrels to bison. These animals can be hunted, but those who don't wish to do so can still appreciate the beauty of the natural world. And of course, the game's excellent photo mode is perfect for getting virtual photos of all those creatures.

  Fatherhood means a lot of things to different people. Like mothers, fathers are significant figures who can shape a child, for better or worse. The expectations and accountability placed upon a parent can be difficult and stressful; the way that a father navigates his role can differ wildly from family to family, making for some extreme contexts when it comes to games.
 </p>
 <p>
  The father figure in horror games is an interesting one; the genre has seen terrible ones and those who would go to the end of the world and back for their child. As such,
  <strong>
   horror games exploring fatherhood
  </strong>
  have delved equally into themes of guilt, grief, and protectiveness — occasionally a combination of all three. This list compiles some of the best titles.

  The
  <em>
   Amnesia

  franchise has had its fair share of twisted protagonists, from mass murderers to calculated killers. While it is hard to sympathize with these characters,
  <em>
   <strong>
    A Machine for Pigs
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes a different approach with a more complex narrative about a father's will to save his children.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game follows elitist businessman and butcher, Oswald Mandus, as he faces disturbing Manpigs that seem hellbent on destroying humanity. Regaining his memory and remembering his own role in the chaos, the player unveils the morally gray extent to which he was willing to protect his children from a horrible future.

  is a psychological horror game that puts the player in the shoes of troubled protagonist Dwayne Anderson through his suburban house as he experiences the macabre fate of its prior inhabitants. The player must survive terrifying encounters as they attempt to escape the
  <em>
   P.T.-

  inspired loops.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's not immediately apparent that this is a game about fatherhood, Dwayne does end up having to face what happened to his family — and his own involvement. There are two endings, generally considered good and bad, with the player's choice at the end determining the outcome.

  Set three years after the first game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Evil Within 2

  starts out by showing just how much Sebastian has been affected by the loss of his daughter, Lily. Now an alcoholic, he is given a chance to reconcile with his past when he is approached by his ex-detective partner, who reveals Lily is, in fact, still alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  From here, the player must embark on a dangerous quest to rescue Lily from the clutches of the volatile biotech organization, Mobius.
  <em>

  on the surface, is a run-of-the-mill survival game. The player controls Eric, the survivor of a plane crash, who must navigate the forested island he has ended up on. The base-building, crafting, and health management all contribute to a fun experience in itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  But beyond the survival gameplay, there is a darker underlying narrative. Eric's son, Timmy, has been kidnapped, and to find him, players must navigate dangerous terrain and cannibal islanders. Following the main story is actually optional, but either way,

  Over the course of the game, their bond develops into a father-daughter-like relationship, one which ends up carrying a lot of weight later in the game when Joel is presented with a potentially world-changing choice.
  <em>
   Part 1'
  </em>
  s focus on the complicated nature of characters' relationships is what truly invests players, and Joel's role as a father figure is a particularly emotional one for many.

   <strong>
    The Walking Dead
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an interactive drama and episodic horror game that takes place shortly after a zombie outbreak. It is memorable for its emotional storylines and the difficult decisions that players are forced to make that, with branching narratives, shape the trajectory of their playthrough.
 </p>
 <p>
  These desperate times form unconventional family units, and
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  does a great job of interrogating survivors' responses to the outbreak. There is no shortage of encounters with fathers willing to fight for their family, and they will stop at nothing to do so. Sometimes this means trusting no-one — other times, it means teaming up — but their actions are almost always motivated by love.

  Harry Mason is one of the most iconic dads in horror games. He makes his first appearance in the franchise's original game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill,
   </strong>
  </em>
  where he embarks on a journey to find his missing adopted daughter, Cheryl, after crashing the car. Unfortunately, this proves a lot more difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the reasons that Harry Mason is so memorable is that he is just an ordinary man, not a police officer or FBI agent or veteran; it is easy for players to root for his success as he is put through hell. Facing horrific creatures and uncovering the true extent of Silent Hill's darkness, Harry plows through all doubts and challenges in pursuit of his daughter.

  Most players hoped for a peaceful life for Ethan Winters after the trauma he went through in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  At the beginning of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil Village,
   </strong>
  </em>
  it seems he has achieved domestic bliss with his wife and baby safely beside him. All that turns upside down, however, when they are abducted, and Ethan finds himself once again on a mission to rescue his family from evil clutches.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, Ethan must face the four lords of the Village, all of whom are under the thumb of Mother Miranda, leader of the Cult of the Black God. Dropped in the middle of a sinister operation, Ethan never surrenders his determination. From being thrown around like a rag doll to losing a hand (again) to getting repeatedly bitten, it is clear that Ethan would stop at nothing to get his baby back. That has to earn him a father of the year award.

  Interestingly, Rocksteady's controversial

  also finds itself in the deep discounts category at $6.99, a mere 10 percent of the game's original price in just over a year since it launched. DC fans who'd like to experience Rocksteady's prior games instead can pick up the
  <em>
   Batman: Return to Arkham
  </em>
  two-game bundle for just $4.99, and they can also buy
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  at an 85 percent discount. Star Wars and Marvel fans haven't been left behind either, with games like
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Star Wars: Squadrons
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Midnight Suns: Enhanced Edition
  </em>
  , and the deluxe edition of
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens
  </em>
  available at compelling prices.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this Xbox sale does include some critically lukewarm or even panned games, there's still a lot to like here. The mainline
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy,
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Legendary Edition
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   BioShock: The Collection
  </em>
  being available for single-digit prices should be a tantalizing prospect for many.

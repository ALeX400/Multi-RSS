  When
  <em>
   <strong>
    Civilization 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Exploration Age comes to an end, players will lose access to a significant number of resources, as they will turn into Factory Resources. This means that they need to build Factories to utilize them. Therefore, during the Modern Age, fans will find themselves building tons of Rail Stations in order to get Factory Resources in their settlements.

  However, some problems will arise if players find themselves wanting to connect two Rail Stations that are separated by water. This guide will show gamers how to connect Rail Stations even if there is an ocean between them.

 <p>
  In order to build Factories in
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  , the settlement must be connected to the Capital by railroad. However, if players settled in Distant Land and didn't change their Capital city during the Age Transition or settled on an island, they won't be able to reach the Capital by land, which makes it impossible to create roads and consequently railroads.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To connect Rail Stations separated by water, gamers must build a Port in their Capital city as well as the settlement
  </strong>
  . This enables gamers to build Factories and slot Factory Resources in islands and Distant Land settlements.

  <strong>
   To build a Port in
   <em>
    Civilization 7
   </em>
   , gamers must research the Steam Engine Technology
  </strong>
  . Thankfully, it is accessible as soon as the Modern Age starts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once they've obtained this Technology, they can build a Port as long as their settlement has at least a Coast tile adjacent to land. On top of connecting a settlement that's separated by water to the Capital, t
  <strong>
   he Port increases the number of resources that can be assigned to the settlement, generates 5 Gold, and grants +1 Gold for each Navigable River Terrain, Coastal Terrain, or Wonder adjacent to it
  </strong>
  . After the Port is finished, gamers will be able to build a Factory in their settlement.

  <strong>
   Roads within a settlement will automatically upgrade into railroads once gamers build a Rail Station
  </strong>
  . If gamers construct more Rail Stations along their empire, they will connect settlements to one another and create a Rail Network.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To build Rail Stations in
   <em>
    Civilization 7
   </em>
   , gamers have to research the Industrialization Technology
  </strong>
  , which becomes accessible pretty early on in the Modern Age. Railroads make it possible for players to build Factories in their settlements once they research Mass Production and they also make it possible to fast travel, which is a useful quality-of-life improvement to any one's
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  run.

  Once players have built two Rail Stations on the same continent, Units will be able to fast travel between them.
  <strong>
   To use the Rail Station in
   <em>
    Civilization 7
   </em>
   , players must place a Unit on the Rail Station or a tile adjacent to it, select the Unit and then the Rails icon that appears in the interactions menu on the bottom right corner of the screen
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, they have to select a tile besides a Rail Station on another settlement - this will instantly teleport them to the other station.

  <strong>
   Couch co-op
  </strong>
  and split-screen tend to be associated with consoles as the terms conjure images of friends playing
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Crash Team Racing
  </em>
  on a TV, but PC owners have plenty of options as well. Nowadays, most major multiplayer releases make their way to Steam, and they typically offer online support to simplify the process of finding partners. LAN parties have generally transitioned to online connections, a decision that permits users to either play with friends or strangers.

  Online is the standard in modern gaming, but that does not mean local co-op has gone extinct. In fact, some of the
  <strong>
   best co-op games on Steam

  2013's
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is almost too good. The free-to-play action RPG delivered roughly a decade's worth of brilliance, firmly establishing itself as one of the definitive dungeon crawlers. Even nowadays, it is still a pretty easy recommendation. However, for all its positives,
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  only supports online co-op, which makes sense for a game that was initially designed with computers in mind. Along with still offering 6-player online co-op, the 2024 sequel adds local multiplayer to the equation, albeit limited to just two people sharing a screen. Controllers are also required on PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  is currently in early access and very much a work-in-progress; consequently, anybody looking to jump on board should be prepared for missing features, a few rough edges, and tweaks/updates that could drastically change the viability of certain builds. Crucially, the early access version is not free, although the full release will go down that route. As such, people who are not sure if this project is for them might wish to wait until version 1.0 drops, which will probably not happen very soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that out of the way, it is now time to say that
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  is fantastic. Improving on nearly every idea found in its predecessor, the sequel is bigger and better, offering more satisfying combat, customization options that come with ridiculous variety, and a pretty good story (from what is currently available). The endgame is also shaping up to be pretty great. In terms of local co-op,
  <em>
   PoE2
  </em>
  is quite a natural fight for the feature, and the classes and their build options encourage parties to put together characters that complement each other.

  After achieving near-perfection with
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  , which is also a great
  <strong>
   co-op PC RPG
  </strong>
  , Larian Studios did the impossible and produced something arguably even better. After spending almost three years in early access,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  finally made its proper debut in August 2023, and to say the game was well-received would be an understatement. Hailed as a new benchmark in the CRPG genre, the long-awaited sequel is a deep and rewarding single-player experience that can easily keep somebody entertained for months on end. A big part of the game's appeal is its flexible and reactive design that seeks to morph the world to complement a player's choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  While a fantastic solo experience,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's local co-op feature is also not an afterthought. Players can join someone's else campaign, or start a new one where they play together from the beginning. Thanks to the use of split-screen, adventurers are not tied to each other, and one party member can head out to explore on their own while their partner does something else. Even though they will likely stick together during most sessions,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  makes it possible for both players to feel in control.

  <em>
   Pico Park 2
  </em>
  can be a frustrating experience, and that is part of its appeal. Tecopark's sequel challenges up to 8 players to take on bit-sized obstacles that can vary considerably in structure, presentation, and style. Some are fairly typical puzzles, while other stages dip into genres like action or platforming. Still, the core concept is the same: work together and communicate.
 </p>
 <p>
  In reality, most people will probably have to make do with strangers when playing
  <em>
   Pico Park 2
  </em>
  , at least if they want to add as many players as possible. Still, the game supports 8-player local co-op as well, so the option is technically viable. That said, 2-player co-op is likely to be the more common selection.

  The rise of platforms like Twitch saw the birth of a weird puzzle-platformer subgenre seemingly designed specifically to inspire outrage in streamers.
  <em>
   Only Up!
  </em>
  is probably the most well-known example of this trend, but
  <em>
   Jump King
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy
  </em>
  are also (in)famous and, for a while, were inescapable. As entertaining as it can be to watch someone struggle for hours to climb an abstract tower, or blast through in a matter of minutes, these projects can be hard to recommend in situations when a crowd is not watching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although perfect for Twitch,
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  arguably comes the closest to being a worthwhile all-around gaming experience when someone is craving a challenging platformer. The project's biggest selling point is its co-op implementation, to the point that the feature is highlighted by the title. While solo runs are possible,
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  is designed with multiplayer in mind, allowing for up to four players to be tied together as they try to escape hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  As with
  <em>
   Only Up!
  </em>
  , players have to jump, catch, and climb across floating assets, all the while being fully aware that a single mistake could cause them to lose all of their progress (unless they are playing in Beginner mode). Frustrating as those moments can be,
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  works due to that ever-present fear of catastrophic failure. The co-op adds a nice twist since having another player on board has both positives and negatives.

  Valve is responsible for some of the most popular and long-lasting multiplayer games on the market, most of which revolve around co-op. While games like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Team Fortress 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Alien Swarm
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  all prioritize teamwork, they are generally associated with online multiplayer or LAN support more so than local co-op. The same could be said for
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  to an extent, although the game is better equipped to take advantage of local two-player action than most of the developer's other projects. For one, the title supports split-screen right out of the box, which makes it a more viable option than the
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  games.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2011 release reached legendary status thanks to its single-player story, which arguably ranks alongside
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  as Valve's magnum opus. Less known is
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  's co-op campaign that sees two robots work together to try and complete GLaDOS's various challenges. Gameplay-wise, this mode retains many of the same fundamentals as the single-player; however, these identical mechanics take on a new flavor when a second player is thrown into the mix.

  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  has been in early access for over a decade, which is typically not a great sign. However, the open-world survival game has somehow managed to remain relevant, and it is still receiving fairly consistent updates as it gradually moves towards its full release. Even if that day seems to be still far in the future,
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  is already in an impressive state that makes it an easy recommendation for anyone craving a sandbox zombie experience that emphasizes survival above everything else.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not part of the game's original 2013 Steam release, split-screen co-op support was added to the package a few years later, allowing four friends to work together to try and make the best of a terrible situation. Online co-op is also available through 32-player lobbies, making the early access project a rather robust multiplayer option.

  Studio MDHR's
  <em>
   Cuphead
  </em>
  puts players through the wringer, overwhelming them with colorful bosses inspired by old-school cartoons. This journey will always be crushingly difficult, but Cuphead does not need to face the Devil's debtors alone. He can be accompanied by Mugman (or Ms. Chalice in
  <em>
   The Delicious Last Course
  </em>
  DLC), although the power of friendship might not result in an easier time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although an acquired taste,
  <em>
   Cuphead
  </em>
  achieves everything it sets out to do. The game's visuals are eye-catching, its gameplay is punishing but generally fair, and the soundtrack is great. Provided people are looking for a challenge, this project is one of the
  <strong>
   best local co-op games on Steam
  </strong>

  Originally a 2008 Xbox 360 exclusive,
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  eventually made its way to other platforms, including a 2012 Steam release. Invariably, each port served to further cement the game's status as a co-op masterpiece. Players pick a knight and bravely head out to save four princesses, a process that involves a lot of hacking and slashing through cartoonish enemies. The color-coded playable characters not only come with unique abilities but also support build variety through customizable stats and weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  represents co-op at its absolute best, especially since it encourages players to form balanced parties. Also, the game is pretty funny in a very late 2000s type of way.

  The
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  games are just delightful. All three titles are top-notch indie RPGs that blend enjoyable combat with silly but well-written stories, fast-paced exploration, and streamlined progression. While the first entry is solely single-player, both sequels support two-player co-op, with
  <em>
   Cat Quest 2
  </em>
  being specifically designed with the feature in mind. In fact, even solo runs revolve around two protagonists, albeit one controlled by AI.

  Konami has largely ignored
  <em>
   Contra
  </em>
  over the last 15 years, producing only two entries between 2010 and 2023.
  <em>
   Hard Corps: Uprising
  </em>
  is a pretty good spin-off, while
  <em>
   Contra: Rogue Corps
  </em>
  is a top contender for the franchise's worst game. Due to this lengthy absence,
  <em>
   Contra: Operation Galuga
  </em>
  's announcement came as a bit of a surprise, especially since the 2024 release is a fairly faithful throwback to the run-and-gun license's glory days. In fact, it is a direct sequel to the original 1987 title, revisiting many of the same locations and reusing similar enemies. After being starved for attention for so long,
  <em>
   Contra
  </em>
  just needed to produce something decent that could remind the world why it was once a staple of gaming.
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  generally fulfills that purpose, offering a safe but enjoyable campaign that is fun solo and fantastic with friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to the older entries,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  pulls no punches, delivering a challenging and non-stop romp that throws everything at the player. However, the game also includes enough modern touches to allow for a degree of accessibility, so even though newcomers might be overwhelmed at first, that feeling should pass after a while. While the core gunplay is largely the same,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  's multiple playable characters all have unique abilities and nuances that help differentiate them; consequently, during co-op, players can pick the person that best suits their preferences.

  is a stressful restaurant sim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to four players must step into a kitchen and keep the dishes rolling as orders pile up. Like the real deal, organization and teamwork are vital if chefs want to stay ahead of the curve, and they should also prepare for occasional bouts of frustration. Even when things reach a boil,
  <em>

  is still an absolute blast to play, and it is a perfect option for short sessions.

  Surviving space is always difficult, but having the right partners can make the process a bit less painful.
  <em>
   Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
  </em>
  is a co-op game that really emphasizes communication and coordination. Players find themselves stuck in a spaceship that requires seven crew members to man all of its stations; unfortunately, at most, only four people are available. Consequently, players will have to regularly jump from station to station to try and keep things moving forward, an accomplishment that is easier said than done. Each station has its complexities, and they must all be properly managed if a successful and safe flight is to be achieved.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
  </em>
  can only be played in local co-op, although Steam's remote play is an option as well. This decision makes sense because players need to maintain open lines of communication to ensure they coordinate their efforts well. Wasted movement is a death sentence, and this is one of those games that can test a few friendships.

  One of the better co-op games of 2023,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  builds on the ideas of its predecessor and goes for broke in terms of its story. While playable solo, SMG's project is undoubtedly intended to be enjoyed as part of a group, and the game is hard to recommend if someone plans to mostly play on their own. The premise is fairly straightforward: carry furniture. That's largely it. Players have a moving service, one that is willing to take on most jobs regardless of their destination. Sometimes, that could mean traveling to another dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  With purposefully wonky physics and a strong sense of humor,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  can inspire laughter and frustration in equal measure, although the latter does not usually stick around for too long.

  Arrowhead knows a thing or two about co-op, and while most of the company's projects are not necessarily amazing, they are decent additions to the multiplayer space. 2011's
  <em>
   Magicka
  </em>
  is a solid adventure game that is only difficult to recommend because its sequel is superior; meanwhile,
  <em>
   Gauntlet
  </em>
  is a solid co-op dungeon crawler. The developer's crowning achievement is undoubtedly
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  , a twin-stick shooter that pits humanity against three enemies in a gloriously over-the-top war.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the core gameplay is typical for the genre, the title gets most of the basics right, and it also includes a fun multiplayer option that expands its replayability. Supporting 4-player co-op (and friendly fire),
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  is at its best when a group of soldiers is taken on the Cyborgs or bugs. This allows the team to coordinate their load-outs, adding an element of strategy to the matches.

  On a random sunny day in an English town, all hell breaks loose when a goose (or geese) arrives on the scene.
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  offers silly, comedic fun, casting players as wild animals that are mainly driven by a desire to spread confusion across a town that is not prepared for these sorts of shenanigans. While working towards a shiny goal, the game largely leaves players to their own devices, allowing them to honk and steal to their hearts' content.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is a blast solo, especially since a playthrough should not last more than a couple of hours. Co-op does not change the core experience all that much, but it does ramp up the chaos sufficiently, making for an even more fun time. Either way, this title is an easy recommendation.

  Once the campaign's prologue is completed,
  <em>
   Children of Morta
  </em>
  opens up its local co-op option, permitting two players to take on the roguelite's procedurally generated challenges. The Bergsons exist to protect the world, which generally involves taking on the many monstrosities that exist within Mount Morta. Initially, only two members of the family are playable, but the roster expands as players get further into the campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  While failure does reset progress in the dungeons, the game does not completely start over, and
  <em>
   Children of Morta
  </em>
  even has a story that develops in between runs. Each character has their own play styles, strengths, and weaknesses, which adds a wonderful dimension to co-op since players should try to complement each other.

  Gathering quite a lot of praise when it launched in 2023,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  is an impressive indie darling that takes very obvious inspiration from classic JRPGs of the '90s. Sabotage Studio put together an ambitious, gorgeous, and lengthy campaign that starts slow but builds up considerable momentum as it moves along. Considering the story revolves around dual protagonists and introduces a third-party member early on, co-op seemed like a fairly natural fit for the story; however,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  did not launch with this component. Fortunately, in November 2024, Sabotage released a free update that, among other changes, added support for 3-player local co-op.
 </p>
 <p>
  Controlling three different characters who are all visible on screen,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  ' co-op implementation is surprisingly robust, turning the campaign into a full-blown multiplayer experience rather than just an adventure with a main player and two guests. Whether this feature entices a revisit from people who already played through the story will vary from person to person, but a co-op run is certainly worth consideration for new players.
  <em>
   Sea of Stars

  is quite long too.

      <title>The Sims 4: Businesses &amp; Hobbies' Title May be Misleading</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Players have been shocked over the past month as EA and Maxis have announced plenty of fun content in titles across
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise in honor of its twenty-fifth anniversary. As currently the most popular game in the franchise,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  has received the lion’s share of new content, with an additional Expansion Pack and three new Kits announced on February 4. The Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack certainly has Simmers abuzz, but a handful of players find the title slightly misleading.

 <p>
  As mentioned, players were teased about Businesses &amp; Hobbies when the Motherlode Season roadmap was released on February 4. From there, a release trailer for the upcoming Expansion Pack dropped on February 6. A gameplay trailer for Businesses &amp; Hobbies is still on the horizon, but this reveal trailer seems to focus more on the pack’s business gameplay.

 <p>
  Although the title and some features of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  's Businesses &amp; Hobbies were leaked in January, the pack’s initial trailer still thrilled Simmers. Like all other Expansion Packs, Businesses &amp; Hobbies comes with new gameplay, Create-a-Sim (CAS), Build and Buy items, and an entirely new world. Nordhaven seems inspired by Sweden and Scandinavia and has approximately twelve lots, six per neighborhood. Businesses &amp; Hobbies will launch on March 6 at the typical Expansion Pack cost of $40.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the most exciting aspects of Businesses &amp; Hobbies revolve around a highly requested game feature. Players can now set lots to multipurpose functions with rooms available to the public, employees, or only residents. In simple terms, players can now build businesses with their own residential section - for example, a café on the bottom floor with a residential space on the top floor. Simmers have wanted multipurpose lots for years, but
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  team took things a step further by making the feature so customizable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Businesses will be further expanded in the pack as practically every skill can now be monetized. From teaching classes to charging entry fees, even the most obscure skills can make your Sims motherlodes of money. However, the second half of the Businesses &amp; Hobbies title feels overlooked. While this Expansion Pack certainly distinguishes itself from
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  ’s previous business-focused pack Get to Work, the pack’s promised hobbies are underwhelming.

 <p>
  Businesses &amp; Hobbies introduces two new major hobbies to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  : the tattoo skill and the pottery skill. Both new skills feature some radical gameplay and entirely new items for the game. Pottery feels more standard as it joins art-based skill additions, with pottery wheels and kilns now entering the game. Players can even use the Japanese art of kintsugi to mend their pottery.
 </p>
 <p>
  In comparison, the tattoo skill features new items necessary for its gameplay and further expands
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  ’s CAS. While new tattoo designs like the ones that have always been available in CAS are being added in the Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack, players can now draw tattoos similarly to the paint tool for animals in the Horse Ranch and Cats and Dogs Expansion Packs.
 </p>
 <p>
  These two hobbies clearly involve a ton of new gameplay, but Businesses &amp; Hobbies seemingly features only two new skills. While candy making is shown in the trailer, EA and Maxis did not discuss this ability in the blog post announcing Businesses &amp; Hobbies. Additionally, most of the pack seems dedicated to creating new businesses, with EA and Maxis even announcing Businesses &amp; Hobbies cross-pack compatibility to boost business experiences for older DLC. Because
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  team seems dedicated to the first half of the new pack’s title, some players understandably feel that hobbies have been left to the wayside. Others argue that quality matters more than quantity. The pottery and tattoo skills feature intricate gameplay and expand one of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  ’s core features, proving that these hobbies are worthwhile even if they seem underutilized.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack debuts on March 6. Perhaps players will feel less misled by the pack’s title when they try out these new hobbies in

  With an astounding volume of individual items of clothing, accessories and shoes, the wardrobe of the average accomplished player in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  is nothing short of spectacular. Once players begin to progress through the story, they can unlock more and more outfits, including Ability outfits, which are important early on.
 </p>
 <p>
  One sticking point with the game is that, at least initially, it can be somewhat unclear as to which outfits players should prioritize when it comes to evolution and upgrades. To help out, here is a complete list of which specific outfits players would most benefit from leveling up early on in the game. Obviously, when looking to level-up outfits early on in gameplay, the only real thing players need to concentrate on is their personal preferences as to which ensembles they favor aesthetically. The following are presented in this way, with the most beautiful outfits at the top of the list.

  Bubbly Voyage is one of two Floating Ability outfits in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , with the other one called Blooming Dreams. Even though either outfit is an excellent place to start when looking into outfit evolution early on in the game, Bubbly Voyage is the outfit players receive in the prologue and logically, therefore, the best of the two to focus on. Bubbly Voyage (and Blooming Dreams) allow Nikki to
  <strong>
   float into the air immediately after jumping.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Bubbly Voyage consists of every shade of blue under the sun, with a pinstriped dress and a lacy, ballerina-style hem. The dress is off the shoulder, with see-through white mesh sleeves and the outfit is finished off with a blue ribbon around Nikki's neck and a midnight blue bow through her hair. The evolution of Bubbly Voyage is still pretty, but the different blue hues are replaced with a pale, pastel green.

   purify both the Esselings and the Dark Essence.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The original Wind of Purity outfit is almost neutral in color, with subtle flowers and plant designs on the hem of the dress. However, when Wind of Purity is leveled up, it evolves into the stunning Wind of Purity: Dawn. This dress is considerably more detailed; silver and light gray in color, with blue gemstones and moon ornamental finishes. In Wind of Purity: Dawn, Nikki's hair is jet black.

  To obtain the Forest's Fluttering outfit, players need to guide Nikki to the Resonance Banner and receive each of the nine pieces individually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though both Bug Catching outfits are visually impressive, the Forest's Fluttering look is definitely superior. The stand-out feature has to be the Emerald Fluttering waistcoat, which appears as if a sparkling green and gold butterfly is hugging Nikki around the waist. Forest's Fluttering's evolution becomes Forest's Fluttering: Pearl Wings, which transforms the outfit into a lilac and sparkling light purple ensemble.

  Shark Mirage is a real showstopper of an outfit. As its primary ability, it
  <strong>
   lets Nikki use a fishing rod
  </strong>
  to catch fish in bodies of water. Shark Mirage is officially a cool-styled outfit, but due to the natural esthetics and abilities, it is also relatively high in the Fresh stakes too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who are looking to earn the Shark Mirage outfit and then evolve it into Shark Mirage: Summer need to collect all nine items from their Pear Pal in the Resonate tab. Shark Mirage's original look has life buoys as fasteners and waterproof and windproof additions to the jacket and bottoms, all in pale and duck egg blue.

  The Symphony of Strings outfit, unlike many other outfits available to Nikki earlier on in the game, is entirely unique in the Ability it provides to the player. Once the individual items are found and the outfit has been crafted, Nikki becomes much more musically minded and is able to
  <strong>
   play the violin.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the real magic lies, however, is in the Symphony of Strings outfit's evolution, when it becomes Symphony of Strings: Woods. The colors of the ensemble are absolutely beautiful, based in forest green with mint and brown accents. Nikki's hair in Symphony of Strings: Woods is a beautiful and subtle red-auburn shade. The Woods variation of Symphony of Strings is reminiscent of the Departing Bloom ensemble.

  Considering the powerful, not to mention impressive, Ability that the Fully Charged outfit provides the player, it is exceedingly lucky that it is possible for them to get their hands on the outfit during Chapter 1 of the game. The Fully Charged outfit is more of a uniform than anything else, and once the outfit has been crafted, it gives Nikki the ability to
  <strong>
   fix any and all electrical problems
  </strong>
  in the game.

  The Fully Charged evolution is absolutely beautiful, and is the perfect combination of practicality and stylish cuts and fabrics. Before evolution, the jumpsuit is orange with splashes of black, but once evolved, the only black that remains is on the collar. The jumpsuit itself turns into a silver and gray number, with baby pink and hot pink details, hardware and accents.

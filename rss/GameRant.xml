  Scarlet Spider is the last card to join
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Snap
   </em>
  </strong>
  in The Amazing Spider-Season. He is an Activate character with the ability to create an exact clone of himself in one of the other two locations.

  While Scarlet Spider may not be a META-shaking addition, he introduces interesting synergies that, while not overly effective, can be enjoyable to play. He has also revitalized Namora, an often-overlooked Power booster in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  with significant potential. Here’s a sample deck for Scarlet Spider that leverages the fun of playing him while maintaining consistent performance.

  In the current metagame, Scarlet Spider is a practical addition to
  <strong>
   a buff-oriented Namora-Gwenpool deck
  </strong>
  . To replicate this setup, combine this trio (Scarlet Spider, Namora, and Gwenpool) with the following cards: Shuri, Wong, Odin, Zabu, Forge, Phastos, Arana, Hulkbuster, and Symbiote Spider-Man.

 <h3 id="the-synergies-of-the-scarlet-spider-deck">
  The Synergies of the Scarlet Spider Deck
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Namora and Gwenpool are the primary sources of buffs
   </strong>
   . If you use these cards on Scarlet Spider, you could potentially generate up to 32 Power on the board. (That is if Gwenpool targets Scarlet Spider three times.)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Shuri, Forge, Phastos, and Arana function as support buff cards
   </strong>
   . In an ideal scenario, they can provide Scarlet Spider with additional Power before you activate him.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Symbiote Spider-Man serves dual purposes
   </strong>
   : he merges into one card, freeing up space on the board, and retriggers one of the buff effects.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Hulkbuster is included to prevent lane clogging
   </strong>
   . Since clone-based decks can be vulnerable to running out of space, he helps mitigate that issue.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Zabu ensures that you can play multiple four-cost cards
   </strong>
   , as several key players in the deck cost four.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Wong and Odin are included to double On Reveal effects
   </strong>
   and maximize the buffs from your cards.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Scarlet Spider’s effect is quite similar to Mister Sinister’s. The only difference is that you get to decide when to summon or activate the clone, and—unlike Mister Sinister—Scarlet Spider’s clone goes to one of the other two locations.

 <p>
  A reliable strategy for Scarlet Spider is a buff-oriented play. You want to hit this card with as many Power boosters like Forge, Gwenpool, and Namora as possible so that his clone is a formidable spawn.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Scarlet Spider's Activate effect cannot be duplicated
   </strong>
   . A common mistake is trying to combine Symbiote Spider-Man with Scarlet Spider in hopes of doubling his effect. However, as noted by the developers, there's currently no way to retrigger an Activate text.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Scarlet Spider clone will never spawn in the location of the base card
   </strong>
   . You cannot predict which lane the clone will land in unless one of the other two locations is already clogged.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Scarlet Spider is not a reliable win condition
   </strong>
   . It's wise not to invest all your Power in him, as he functions better as a backup card rather than a primary powerhouse.

  The ultimate counter to Scarlet Spider is Shadow King. Additionally, you can neutralize his effect with Red Guardian, provided there aren’t any weaker enemy cards in his lane. Another potential counterplay is Shang-Chi, as he is likely to exceed ten power in most decks.

  While not an essential card, Scarlet Spider is
  <strong>
   a worthwhile investment as he fits into multiple archetypes
  </strong>
  . Currently, his main drawback is being limited to only one clone, but this can be overcome by buffing him multiple times or hitting him with Arnim Zola.

  One reviewer noted, “[Scarlet Spider] is solid; he’s mid-range. He is probably going to work in a lot of METAs. I also see a good and bright future for him.” Scarlet Spider could become one of the most sought-after cards if a card similar to Odin is introduced to double Activate effects. Nevertheless, even without such additions, he remains a consistent and practical choice in the current metagame.

  Disney &amp; Pixar bring forth their first collab to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  with
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  , the famed set of Supers that featured two decades ago in 2004 but are still going strong. From Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone, the cast of characters from
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  is joyous and impressive, and now players can add these icons to their
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  lockers provided that they have the V-Bucks for them.

  Obtaining Elastigirl in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  might be just as much a dream as Mr. Incredible and Frozone, and now with this trio of Supers, players can grow their Disney roster alongside Marvel icons, while also enjoying a plethora of hero skins in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  that crosses over from just Marvel and DC. The Incredibles enter
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  with triumphant fare, bringing along outfits, cosmetics, and emotes that can spice up their lockers.

  The Incredibles consist of Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl (Mrs. Incredible), and Frozone. Players can acquire all three of these outfits separately, or in a bundle under The Incredible Bundle. The Incredible Bundle can be purchased for 3,500 V-Bucks. Purchasing each cosmetic separately would cost 7,200 V-Bucks, so to those who are huge fans of
  <em>
   The Incredibles

  , grabbing this 14 Item Bundle is a great idea and good value for their V-Bucks, and the bundle itself comes with:

   Frozone is the effortlessly cool Super that slides his way to
   <em>
    Fortnite

   with an icy style for 1,800 V-Bucks
  </strong>
  . Frozone's outfit is sleek and fashionable, as is his charismatic smile. It's great to see Frozone in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , and one has to wonder about the argument he had with his wife about finding his super suit, since Frozone is about to get busy with Battle Royale,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival, and Rocket Racing, as well as LEGO
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  thanks to the free addition of a LEGO minifigure. Frozone comes in at 300 V-Bucks more than his Superfriends, and that's because he comes with Frozone's Shield, which is both a Back Bling and a Pickaxe.

  Arc System Works has revealed the release date for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Guilty Gear Strive
   </strong>
  </em>
  's first Season 4 character, with Queen Dizzy being added on October 31, 2024.
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  is one of Arc System Works' most popular fighters, having four seasons of post-launch content.
  <em>
   Strive
  </em>
  's season passes have all added a number of returning fan-favorite characters from its history, like Baiken, Slayer, Bridget, and Testament. Characters like Asuka R, Happy Chaos, and Goldlewis Dickinson were all popular newcomers that were added to the game as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  's fourth season of DLC is another balanced case of returning fighters and newcomers. Both Dizzy and Venom are coming back to the roster after being absent from the base game, with both characters being very big fan favorites and highly requested characters. The other two fighters in this season pass are Unika and Lucy; the former being a brand-new character from the upcoming
  <em>
   Guilty Gear: Dual Rulers
  </em>
  anime and the latter being a guest fighter from
  <em>
   Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
  </em>
  . Fans got a first look at Dizzy's new appearance, now christened Queen Dizzy, as well as a release date.

  The teaser trailer starts with Dizzy sitting in a forest, playing with a bird that flies by.
  <em>
   Guilty Gear

  protagonist Sol Badguy stops by, greeting her by addressing her as the Queen. Dizzy then happily says hello to Sol, calling him father, with the two then getting into a battle-ready pose. A tweet on Arc System Works' official account confirms that Dizzy will be released on Halloween, October 31, 2024.

  Dizzy is one of
  <em>
   Guilty Gear
  </em>
  's most beloved characters, first appearing in
  <em>
   Guilty Gear X
  </em>
  , the second mainline entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. She eventually marries Ky Kiske, another veteran fighter of the series, and together they have a child in the form of Sin Kiske. Dizzy is considered the daughter of Sol Badguy, due to a variety of complex circumstances that stem from Sol's past as Frederick Bulsara and his fiance, Aria Hale. Many fans were happy to see Queen Dizzy, as well as the developers acknowledging Sol and Dizzy's newfound familial bond. Queen Dizzy has a more regal appearance compared to her prior outfit in games like
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Xrd
  </em>
  .

  Following Dizzy's release will be Venom, who will be released sometime in early 2025. After Venom will be Unika sometime in 2025, followed by Lucy. Lucy's guest appearance in
  <em>

  </em>
  is quite surprising, as she is the series' first ever crossover fighter, and from a third-party IP instead of an in-house guest from other Arc System Works properties like
  <em>
   BlazBlue
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Under-Night In-Birth
  </em>
  . In the meantime, many fans are excited to see the return of Dizzy in

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player recreated the Space King armor in the game, referencing the hilarious
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  parody from YouTube. It’s quite an artistic way of approaching
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's armor customization system, and one that fans of the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  universe will probably enjoy. Besides, both the YouTube original and
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  feature Tyranids, making the custom armor an especially fitting reference.

 <p>
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  launched with a robust armor customization system, allowing players to explore unprecedented creative freedom in designing the looks of their characters. While many fans use the system as intended, staying true to the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  lore and simply changing the default Ultramarine to look like a soldier from a different legion, some take a more inventive approach. This often results in clever references and hilarious
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  armor designs. Funnily enough, the latest contender in competing for the most ingenious custom armor design might very well become the victor, at least temporarily.

  , and it looks virtually flawless. What makes this particular armor set worth attention is the source material: Space King is a hilarious (and deliberately obvious) animated parody of the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  universe created by Flashgitz from YouTube. In the original video, a group of genetically enhanced super soldiers go on a mission to find the Space King, which is a reference to the God-Emperor of Mankind from
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  ; it’s the armor of those soldiers’ silly captain that’s been meticulously recreated by Megamalistic3. Judging by the comments in the Reddit thread, players sincerely loved this approach.

  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is the latest
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  video game to feature a proper armor customization system, so it feels perfectly natural to use the game as the foundation for entertaining cultural references such as the Space King one. Besides,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  has proven to be hugely successful for Saber Interactive, as revealed by the company’s chief creative officer. It’s been a long time since
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k

  fans were treated to such a high-quality video game based on their favorite sci-fi universe, so it shouldn’t be surprising that
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  has become the most played
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  game on Steam immediately after launch.

  The authentic copy of the Space King armor in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  feels like a proper way to pay homage to the hilarious animated short, which
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  fans thoroughly enjoyed judging by millions of views and an overwhelmingly positive likes-to-dislikes ratio. Considering how big of a hit
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  has been on Steam, many more ingenious armor designs are probably on their way to showcase the creativity of the fandom. However, it remains to be seen if any custom designs will ever outshine the Space King one considering its connection to
  <em>

  </em>
  .

  The myth of werewolves, also known as lycanthropes, can be traced throughout history from ancient Greek literature to medieval Europe and Asian folklore. Today, people generally understand a werewolf to be a human able to shapeshift either completely into a wolf, or a superhuman wolf-person hybrid, be it the cause of magic or science.

 <p>
  Pop culture is now saturated with werewolf media — with series like
  <em>
   Teen Wolf
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shadowhunters
  </em>
  and films such as
  <em>
   The Twilight Saga —
  </em>
  bringing their written and historical counterparts to the screen. It seems only natural, then, that werewolves should make their way into the realm of video games. While games like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  establish werewolves as savage, formidable enemies, these games turn the tables to let the gamer
  <strong>
   play as a werewolf
  </strong>
  and wreak havoc of their own.

  is the first installment of the

As a fighting game, the player must choose a character and fight the remaining nine before facing two bosses. Each character is based on a classic horror figure, from zombie to Sasquatch to vampire.

  Part human, part werewolf, Jon Talbain has a history of internal conflict, but he was able to control his form via a devotion to the strict regime of martial arts. Despite his weakness to silver weapons, he is an otherwise ferocious fighter — Jon Talbain's cartoony yet striking art design establishes him as a worthy playable werewolf in gaming.

   <strong>
    Beast Hour
   </strong>

  is an upcoming player-versus-player game that fuses horror and parkour in a dark steampunk world. The game takes place in 1886 where a substance called Arkana (that gives significant power to machines and humans alike) is in high demand.

 <p>
  The player can choose to be a Raider, mercenary for the Order, or a Beast, proving they are the superior prophesied leaders of the new world. One must complete quests and escape, the other must hunt them down, but there can only be one winner. The Beast offers that classic werewolf feel, with players able to climb up buildings, leap huge distances, and track down and hunt their enemies — which can include other Beasts, vying for control of territory.

   <strong>
    Altered Beast
   </strong>
  </em>
  was originally an 80s arcade game, but it was remade in 2005 by Sega with expanded gameplay and story. The player takes on the role of Luke Custer, who finds himself in Foret City
  <strong>
  </strong>
  after the helicopter transporting him crash lands. After discovering he is a "Genome-Cyborg," Luke embarks on a mission to remember his past.

 <p>
  From the game's get go, the player can transform into a werewolf and back at will. Throughout the game, they can find DNA chips that allow Luke to transform into different beasts, including a Wendigo, a merman, and a dragon, each having their own attacks and abilities.
  <em>
   Altered Beast
  </em>
  is a great nostalgic experience that retains the enjoyable arcade elements of close, beat-em-up combat and boss battles.

  The player must fight to expose and take down Endron and save his family amid a world full of supernatural beings and otherworldly entities — all while being able to transform into a stealthy tracker wolf or a powerful, rage-filled werewolf.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Terraria
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the best 2D survival sandbox games. The player is free to explore a procedurally generated world, full of intriguing enemies, aesthetic biomes, and wacky items. Werewolves are a hardmode enemy, spawning when the moon is full once the player defeats the Wall of Flesh boss. They have a 1.67% chance of dropping an item called the "Moon Charm."

 <p>
  Once the Moon Charm is equipped, the player is able to turn into a werewolf upon nightfall. In werewolf form, the player gains a multitude of useful buffs, including increased melee damage (with increased critical hit chance), faster movement, and better defense, making it well worth the effort to obtain the charm.

  From the developer of

  game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Wolf Among Us
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an episodic mystery game based on the comic book series
  <em>
   Fables.
  </em>
  The player takes on the role of Sheriff Bigby in New York City's Fabletown, a secretive community full of familiar fairy tale characters, from Snow White to Bloody Mary, that are hiding from the humans. When the decapitated head of one of their community turns up at the Woodlands apartment complex, Bigby must investigate.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Wolf Among Us
  </em>
  has a strong, gritty, noir atmosphere throughout the whole game. The quick-time events and dialogue choices can have life or death consequences, a far cry from the traditional happily ever afters. The high stakes, compelling mystery narrative, and unique characters create a world that is easy to invest in.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Diablo 2: Resurrected
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a dark fantasy roleplaying game set after the events of
  <em>
   Diablo.
  </em>
  The player takes control of a hero in search of the source of destruction by following the demon-corrupted Dark Wanderer. Across four acts, they can explore a range of environments, completing quests to uncover the story.

 <p>
  In the expansion,
  <em>
   The Lord of Destruction,
  </em>
  the player can choose the Druid character class. Not only do Druids possess elemental and summoning skills, they also have the ability to shapeshift into a Werewolf from level one. Doing so provides the player with bonuses in attack, health, and stamina that increase with the character's level, making it more than a simple class gimmick. This kind of top-down ARPG isn't for everyone, but the Druid certainly delivers on the power fantasy of being a rampaging Werewolf.

  Released in 2011,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  quickly became one of the most popular games of all time. Playing as the Dragonborn, the player can navigate a world rife with civil war and dragons. Or not — the beauty of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is its open-world exploration and the option to avoid the main story to simply role-play out in the world. Much of
  <em>
   Skyrim'
  </em>
  s appeal lies in the abundance of factions and playable races that offer different abilities and skills.

  By following the Companions questline, the player will eventually be given the opportunity to become a werewolf and gain the power "Beast Form." Obtaining the ring of Hircine during the "Ill Met By Moonlight" quest will grant them unlimited transformations. Once in Beast Form, the player has increased health, stamina, carry capacity, and damage — an almost overpowered state that will strike fear into bandits and dragon priests alike. Granted, players won't be able to heal normally anymore while in Beast Form, but they can still regain health by feasting on their victims, which only further delivers on the werewolf power fantasy.

  is an MMORPG taking place in Tyria, a world overrun by Elder Dragons. While an open-world game, the main story revolves around reuniting the multi-racial guild "Destiny's Edge," who were dedicated to defeating the dragons. The norn are a playable race in
  <em>
   Guild Wars 2,
  </em>
  renowned for their hunting skills but forced from their home by the Ice Dragon.

  One of the norn's racial skills is "Become the Wolf." When Become the Wolf is activated, the "Wolf Form" effect will be applied to the player's character. In this form, a new set of skills become available, including the life stealing "Blood Frenzy" and the fear inducing "Snarl." Wolf Form only lasts 30 seconds before the player is transformed back to their normal norn self, so it doesn't deliver the ultimate werewolf experience, but it does offer small, regular uses of the iconic transformation, along with a more animalistic move set, to regularly fulfill any player's werewolf needs.

  At the game's beginning, the player can choose the race and class of their character. One of the Druid class's starting abilities is "Spiritshift," which allows them to assume the form of an animal. Spriritshift Wolf gives players the change to transform into a wolf that has remarkable speed and attacks that knock their enemies prone. While combat isn't necessary to gain experience, being able to turn into a killer beast will definitely make it tempting.

  the previously considered savage Worgen were made a playable race, partially cured of the curse that turned them into violent beasts. While the player can present as either human or beast with the click of an ability icon, entering combat will automatically transform them into their wolf-like form, granting exceptional movement speed and an increased chance of making a critical hit. The starting area for the Worgen in particular delivers a truly stand-out experience, establishing and fleshing out a rich lore for this unique fantasy race.

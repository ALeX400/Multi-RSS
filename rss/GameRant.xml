  One of Ghostface's fatalities in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  has an interesting change when performed against Kenshi. Some would say that part of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  's notoriety comes from its unique Fatalities, and
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is no exception. Fans look forward to each iteration and check how creative the development team is in terms of conjuring up new ways to finish off opponents. This is also true whenever characters are introduced in the game.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  has once again included new members of the roster for everyone's enjoyment. It has become a series tradition to add guest characters from other big franchises not necessarily related to the story. The most recent addition to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  was
  <em>
   Scream'
  </em>
  s Ghostface. While some would argue that the hooded killer doesn't fit the whole vibe of the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  universe, Ghostface definitely follows in the footsteps that other horror icons have set in the long-running series. Creative moves and Fatalities have made Ghostface into a fan-favorite choice for many. However, it looks like the developers may have snuck in one neat change when using a certain finishing move against Kenshi.

 <p>
  As shown by YouTuber SauloZ, one of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's Ghostface Fatalities has a unique visual when used against Kenshi. In the original Fatality, Ghostface stabs the opponent once, as another Ghostface appears behind the victim. The second killer stabs the combatant in the head, but not before doing a close-up of the victim's eye. As Kenshi is a blindfolded character, the developers changed the eye visual to show a monochromatic visual of Ghostface, presumably from Kenshi's perspective. This is a neat little detail that shows just how much the team has thought about keeping the game's continuity.

 <p>
  Fans have already raved about Ghostface's Fatalities as many believe they are some of the most inventive, yet faithful recreations of movie references. The other Ghostface Fatality in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  shows the character stabbing the opponent, before a camera zooms out to reveal that it was Johnny Cage playing the video game. Another Ghostface shows up to stab Johnny from behind, which is a cool meta Easter egg for those who have watched the
  <em>
   Scream
  </em>
  films.

  It seems NetherRealm Studios has taken the time to carefully craft Ghostface's appearance in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . Fans have been finding neat little details and Easter eggs to discover, and the character hasn't been out for more than a day for Khaos Reigns expansion owners. Some players have already discovered all the Ghostfaces' identites in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  players may want to keep their eyes open for more of these secrets.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Brighter Shores
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the newest point-and-click MMORPG from the mind of
  <em>
   Runescape
  </em>
  creator, Andrew Gower. While fans of its predecessor will find many similarities,
  <em>
   Brighter Shores
  </em>
  sets itself apart with its episodic content structure, allowing players to unlock new professions as they level up and progress through the game.

  One similarity between
  <em>
   Brighter Shores
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Runescape
  </em>
  is the presence of a paid membership, called the Premium Pass in
  <em>
   Brighter Shores
  </em>
  . Purchasing the Premium Pass grants players a variety of benefits, including some that will continue to be added to the game as it continues development throughout its early access period and beyond. Learn all about the benefits of the Premium Pass below.

  The main benefit of purchasing a Brighter Shores Premium Pass is access to all content after Episode 2. While free-to-play players will be able to access all of Hopeport and Hopeforest in Episodes 1 and 2, along with all the professions associated with them, the Mine of Mantuban and Crenopolis can only be accessed in Episodes 3 and 4 by purchasing a Premium Pass.

  While originally planned for the launch of early access, player-to-player trading is currently still in development. However, when it is eventually released, this feature will be exclusive to Premium Pass-holders, requiring players to purchase a pass if they want to buy and sell goods to other players.

  The Premium Pass currently offers several options when being purchased, allowing players to select a duration that makes the most sense for them. They include a recurring 30-day subscription, a one-time 90-day pass, and a one-time 365-day pass. While the price of the Premium Pass may fluctuate as the game introduces new content, purchasing a subscription will lock in the monthly price at the price when the subscription first began.

  Based on the current prices,
  <strong>
   the best deal currently is the 30-day subscription
  </strong>
  . Purchasing a 90-day pass for $23.99 equates to $7.99 per month, while purchasing a 365-day pass for $74.99 equates to $6.16 per month, which are both more expensive than the $5.99 30-day subscription.

  One of
  <strong>
   PlayStation VR
  </strong>
  's best games,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
  </em>
  , may be coming to PS VR 2 soon. The exciting reveal could give PS VR 2 enthusiasts a terrifying experience to enjoy with improved visuals.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
  </em>
  shook up the formula of the series up to that point by pivoting to a first-person perspective and moving away from the existing cast. The first-person POV allowed for some of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  's biggest jumpscares, and also made it a perfect candidate to play in VR. While PlayStation fans have been able to enjoy
  <em>
   RE 7
  </em>
  on PS VR for some time now, this would make the first time that it's been made available on the subsequent and more powerful hardware.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
  </em>
  is getting a physical release for the PS5 in January, following the title's prior digital upgrade for the PS5. While plenty of fans are happy to be seeing a physical version release, the game looks like it may have also been upgraded for compatibility with PS VR 2. An image of the game's cover circulating on a retail site a indicates that the game has been rated R 18+ in Australia, specifically for its "high impact" horror violence, blood and gore, and VR interactivity. This seems to be the first indication that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  could be getting a VR upgrade for the PS VR 2.

  Will There Be a Big Difference With Resident Evil 7 on PS VR 2?
 </h2>
 <p>
  While the original PS VR version of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  received a lot of praise, the original hardware has arguably been left in the dust by the release of the PS VR 2. The resolution per eye has increased from 960 x 1080 to 2000 x 2040, with the PS VR 2 also boasting a slightly wider field of view and IPD adjustments to improve the experience for a wider range of players. With the PS VR hardware's upgrades and the PS5 improvements already made to
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  's textures and resolution, playing
  <em>
   RE 7
  </em>
  in modern-day VR could be an incredible horror experience all over again.

 <p>
  If this turns out to be accurate, this would also be the first time that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  is natively available for a modern VR headset like this one. Despite Meta and Capcom partnering for
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  on the Meta Quest,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  has only had an official virtual reality version on the PlayStation family of consoles. While mods exist to play the PC version with a VR headset, that can come with pitfalls and technical hiccups that can make the experience less than ideal. In other words, for those who have been looking for an immersive, terrifying experience,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  on PS VR 2 may soon satisfy that need.

      <title>A Future Metaphor: ReFantazio Update Should Steal One Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Feature</title>

  Arguably, two of the biggest JRPGs of the year are Square Enix's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  and Atlus'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with both titles receiving numerous nominations at the 2024 Game Awards. While the success of both titles shows what a great year 2024 has been for JRPG fans, there is still room for the more recent of the two titles to improve its quality-of-life features. Specifically,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio

  should look toward
  <em>

  A core aspect of the JRPG genre is the makeup of a party, with games like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  both boasting a large cast of playable characters. As such, managing the party to best fit whatever situation the game throws at the player is a crucial part of finding success in the genre. Although
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  gives players the tools to easily swap their party setup to fit their current situation,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  makes things a bit more complicated and could really benefit from borrowing
  <em>
   FF7 Rebirth
  </em>
  's approach.

  How Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Party Loadout System Helps Balance its Large Cast
 </h3>
 <p>
  With players getting to expand their party from the previous entry in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  project in
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  , Square Enix included a useful feature to ensure players can make full use of the game's entire roster. From the Edit Party menu,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  players can create three separate party presets that they can swap between as needed. This feature makes it so much easier to customize different loadouts to adapt to any situation without the hassle of going in and changing every party member's equipment and Materia individually.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":347} -->
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  features several instances where certain party members aren't available to use in combat, so this feature is important to utilize so players can ensure they are regularly rotating through party members as necessary. Although
  <em>
   FF7 Rebirth
  </em>
  doesn't have a job system like other
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games, it still allows players to customize the loadouts of its characters to fill certain roles, so swapping between different equipment can get tedious without the use of the party preset feature.
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  , on the other hand, gets even more complex than
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  with its party customization options, making it all the more apparent that the game needs some kind of preset-saving feature.

  Metaphor: ReFantazio's Archetype System Means Players Need to Swap Loadouts on the Fly
 </h3>
 <p>
  With 46 Archetypes to choose from,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  players have their work cut out when building their ideal team setup. Splitting these Archetypes across seven party members means there are a ton of potential combinations for players to experiment with, especially when players consider which skills to inherit from other Archetypes they've studied. As such, fine-tuning a party composition in
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  can be an entire game in itself, and allowing players to save certain party setups would go a long way toward streamlining this process.

  Changing the party setup to adapt to the current challenge is even more necessary in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  than in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , as the game even tells players which Archetypes are recommended for combat before entering a dungeon. If players could prepare ahead of time and easily swap between preset party loadouts while in a dungeon, it would go a long way toward streamlining the process of tackling the game's side quests and dungeons during in-game free time.

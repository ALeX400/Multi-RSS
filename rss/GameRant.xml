	Last year, the reveal trailer for
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Solarpunk
	 </em>
	</strong>
	flew quietly under the radar, but fans have caught wind of this
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	-meets-
	<em>
	 Stardew-Valley
	</em>
	fusion. From this newfound attention comes the demand for
	<em>
	 Solarpunk
	</em>
	to feature on Xbox Game Pass.

 <p>
	Published by Rokaplay and developed by Cyberware,
	<em>
	 Solarpunk
	</em>
	is a survival game set in a futuristic world full of floating islands. Players can gather materials, grow crops, build gadgets, and explore other areas in an airship. Elemental advantages like sunlight, wind, and rain can be used to craft an energy-efficient system for watering plants and mining resources.
	<em>
	 Solarpunk
	</em>
	will act as German developer Cyberwave's first solo project, having previously co-developed
	<em>
	 Balloon Flight
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Sloth Simulator
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Hourglass
	</em>
	. The game is confirmed to be coming to Steam, but the fate of
	<em>
	 Solarpunk
	</em>
	's console release seems to be in the hands of the fans.

 </h2>
 <p>
	On May 31, the team behind
	<em>

	Only time will tell if
	<em>

	earns an Xbox release, but the odds are good. Cyberware's other titles have received positive reviews on Steam, particularly
	<em>
	 Hourglass
	</em>
	, a puzzle-solving game set in Ancient Egypt. Players control Aywa, an adventurer navigating Egypt in search of her missing father, a respected archaeologist.
	<em>
	 Solarpunk

	.

	<em>

			<title>Final Fantasy 14: Inside Rehearsals for Digital Theater</title>

 <p>
	Virtual theater is a growing field in online games, and nowhere is this more true than in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Final Fantasy 14
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. From Curtain Call Theater to A Stage Reborn, the culture of virtual theater is practically legendary. Of course, it isn’t limited to
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy
	</em>
	, with
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	hosting the Wasteland Theatre Company among others too.

	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14
	</em>
	players have established a fleshed-out community of sporting events, community festivals, museums, and more. That includes a theatrical community spanning many companies of performers. Game Rant recently spoke to several experts from
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14
	</em>
	’s theatrical community, including Stanzek Rosyasch and Soso, about how these companies prepare and rehearse, as well as adapt stories from the real world to the setting of Etheirys.

	How to Rehearse in Virtual Theater
 </h2>
 <p>
	Recently,
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14
	</em>
	’s Firebird Theater staged a production of the Sherlock Holmes classic
	<em>
	 A Scandal in Bohemia
	</em>
	(which was localized for Etheirys as
	<em>
	 A Scandal in Aldenard
	</em>
	), where Stanzek Rosyasch played the part of Watson. Rosyasch talked to Game Rant as part of a virtual theater roundtable, discussing the way they prepared for the role.

 <blockquote>
	<p>
	 We join in voice chat to hear calls and instructions. It also helps with communication between actors. “Sorry, I was late on that!” Helps everyone understand that the action you just did is an anomaly and won’t normally be that delayed. It’s generally very quiet, out of respect for everyone’s focus, but that doesn’t mean we are all super serious all the time! There are days when the giggles strike everyone and we embrace it. Little mistakes become inside jokes, sometimes we intentionally do non-disruptive things.

 <p>
	That sense of fun can be helpful to ease the pressure of rehearsals, which can be strictly regimented experiences. For Rosyasch, rehearsals were held on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays in the afternoon and early evening. Part of balancing the focus and work of production with the fun of the craft, though, was grouping scenes to be performed in a way that may not be the order scenes are performed on stage to allow some actors nights off here or there, he explained. Another example of adding a bit of fun to the whole process that Rosyasch gave was when he asked what the dress rehearsals would entail. Someone quipped that it meant wearing a dress, so when the day came around, all the actors showed up in the same dress.

 <p>
	As for what rehearsals entail, the nature of them is obviously different from flesh-and-blood performances. While some things are less intensive, others are far harder. A major challenge in
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14
	</em>
	in particular is cues and timing. Where in real-world performances cues are often something that can be logically understood and there’s a certain element of natural movement involved in timing, performances in Etheirys require the timing precision of intense choreography without some of the natural and logical indicators that can make those easy to remember. This is because these digital plays rely on the macro tools present in
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14.
	</em>

 <h2 id="much-ado-about-macros">
	Much Ado About Macros
 </h2>
 <p>
	Macros allow players to coordinate actions, lines of dialogue, emotes, and more. In order for them to work with multiple people, like in a real-world play, the timing becomes a tightrope. Without precision timing, the lack of synchronization of the macros grows worse until it's time for the next macro. As Soso explained, macros are one of the most important tools for performers in the game.

 <p>
	Soso explained that where the average player may use a macro to link two actions together, like Swiftcast and Resurrection, but macro performers will use it to sync lines with emotes or actions. Virtual theater takes the macro performer’s use of the tool to the next level.

 <blockquote>
	<p>
	 Each macro can only have 15 lines. Of those 15 lines, at least half of those lines need to be used for emotes. On top of that, an actor may also need to use some of those macro lines for initiating a countdown so that actions properly line up on the stage, be used for an echo to help the actor remember what their blocking is or when they're supposed to do a certain action outside their macros (like if they need to move and then take a seat), or to use even more emotes because an expression emote is needed to change the feel of an emote.

 <p>
	That means, in a full play, there will often be dozens of macros needed for the
	<em>
	 FF14
	</em>
	performance. That, too, can be an issue if people have macros set aside for HUD features or other conveniences. Players only have access to 200 macro slots, so it's important real estate for actors in
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 14
	</em>
	. That’s primarily an issue for actors, but Soso stressed that accommodating the limits of the macro system is also on the scriptwriters.

	Microsoft is planning to confirm the existence of an
	<strong>
	 Xbox
	</strong>
	handheld console in June 2024, an established leaker has said. The claim suggests that the much-rumored Xbox device could be significantly closer to hitting the market than initially expected.

	Xbox handheld rumors have been circulating online for a while now, with the most recent wave of such reports dating back to early 2024. But all insider accounts asserting that a portable Xbox device is in the works have labeled it as part of the next, tenth generation of gaming consoles. Microsoft itself doesn't expect that console generation to arrive before 2028, according to some chat log transcripts between its executives that surfaced in the discovery phase of the company's recent legal battle with the FTC over the Activision Blizzard deal.

	Next Xbox Games Showcase Rumored to Include Handheld Console Teaser
 </h2>
 <p>
	Spanish leaker eXtas1s has now cast some major doubts on that release timeline, asserting that Microsoft will confirm its first portable console's existence as early as this month. Specifically, the company is planning to tease the handheld device at the June 9 Xbox Games Showcase, eXtas1s said in a late May YouTube video. The plan is to offer just a "small" teaser, the leaker claimed, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

 <p>
	Even if the upcoming showcase doesn't deliver a full reveal of the device, the rumor itself suggests that Microsoft's first handheld may not be part of the next-gen Xbox lineup. Since the upcoming console generation is still estimated to be at least four years away, sharing any kind of hardware teasers—no matter how small—would be an entirely unprecedented move for Microsoft to make. It hence appears plausible that if eXtas1s's information is accurate and such a glimpse of an Xbox handheld device does arrive come June 9, whatever it ends up showing will likely be ready to hit the market way before the next generation of consoles does circa 2028.

	Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has himself recently stoked Xbox handheld console rumors on social media. Several early 2024 reports have also suggested that the tech giant is currently in the process of transitioning to an "every screen is an Xbox" gaming strategy. A portable console would align with that purported approach.

	Microsoft May Shadow-Drop a New First-Party Game at the Xbox Games Showcase
 </h2>
 <p>
	Aside from this blockbuster handheld claim, eXtas1s has recently also shared some additional insights into the June 2024 Xbox Games Showcase. Among other things, the leaker reported that Microsoft plans to shadow-drop a first-party game that has already been announced as part of the event. Obsidian Entertainment's
	<em>
	 Avowed
	</em>
	and Stoic Studio's
	<em>
	 Towerborne
	</em>
	both fit that description, especially since both are currently targeting a 2024 launch but neither has committed to a firm release date. The leaker also estimated that the June 9 showcase will see Microsoft share around a dozen first-party game trailers in total.

	<strong>
	 <em>
		Lethal Company
	 </em>
	</strong>
	creator Zeekerss announced the highly anticipated Version 55 is scheduled for release on June 25 or sooner. Two months have elapsed since
	<em>
	 Lethal Company
	</em>
	's last major release, with Version 50 widely regarded as the biggest patch for the game throughout its entire lifetime. Since then, fans have been eagerly anticipating what the developer might have in store for the next big content update, and how Zeekerss planned to further evolve the hit horror co-op title's formula after implementing such massive changes.

 <p>
	The viral success of
	<em>
	 Lethal Company
	</em>
	in the weeks following its 2023 launch was made all the more remarkable when considering the fact that it was created by a single former
	<em>
	 Roblox
	</em>
	game creator, whose game even went on to inspire a surprisingly engaging April Fools parody. As the sole developer and publisher for
	<em>
	 Lethal Company
	</em>
	, Zeekerss has additionally continued to pump out update after update, culminating in the biggest patch to release in the game's history on
	<em>
	 Lethal Company
	</em>
	's half-year anniversary back in April. Even after the addition of several new moons and entities, the developer is still working on more content, though as always, he has remained tight-lipped regarding what he has in store.

	Luckily, fans of the hit co-op horror game won't have to wait much longer to experience it for themselves, as Zeekerss shared a video on his official YouTube channel announcing that Version 55 will go live by June 25 at the latest. Apart from the release date, the video additionally gives fans a glimpse into one of the biggest features planned in the next major update with gameplay footage of the Company Cruiser, a red van that is releasing with Version 55.

	Tekken and Fellow Fighting Franchises Inspire OutRage's Gameplay
 </h3>
 <p>
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	is one of the most popular fighting franchises around, and
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	has gotten clear inspiration from the series. There are many great entries in the
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	franchise, and the longevity of the series has inspired many other fighting titles. However, one of the best features of
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	is its heavily stylized violence that can be gloriously over-the-top.

 <p>
	The absurdity of
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	's action is iconic, and it has directly inspired the fighting mechanics of
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	. The violence in
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	is cartoonishly fun and stylized, which
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	does incredibly well. In
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	, everything in the arena can be used as a weapon, and these objects are used to cause absolute mayhem in matches, bringing classic fighting mechanics a step further.
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	boasts a variety of great characters, and
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	has a delightfully diverse roster that has its own unique appearances that call back to the varied characters of classic fighting franchises.

	OutRage Takes Notes From Fortnite's Multiplayer
 </h3>
 <p>
	One of the most interesting aspects of
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	's gameplay is that it takes a multiplayer fighting game to the next level. The reveal trailer for the game claims that it's the first "mega brawl" game, as matches can be up to 16 players. The description for
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	on the game's Steam page puts an emphasis on chaos, which is easy to make happen when 16 players are going head-to-head in an arena. A clear source of inspiration is
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	.
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	has its own version of a battle royale mode, which
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	notably helped popularize.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	may not be the first battle royale title, but it definitely brought the genre to the mainstream, and
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	has understandably taken note of the popular match mode. Another callback to
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	is found in the game's art style.
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	not only has very stylized violence in the form of
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	, but the game's overall artwork and character aesthetics are incredibly reminiscent of
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	As
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	's Early Access demo continues to be available on Steam, interested gamers can dive in to see what the massive brawler title is all about. There's no telling what the next big multiplayer title will be, but
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	has a lot of potential. With the likes of
	<em>
	 Marvel Rivals
	</em>
	also on the horizon,
	<em>
	 OutRage
	</em>
	already has some major competition for an indie title, but its
	<em>
	 Tekken
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	influences give it a compelling edge.

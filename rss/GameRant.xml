  The
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series, for better or for worse, features a vast range of items that players can use to upgrade their gear or weapons or against tough monsters. A particular subset of in-game items are healing-support items. These support items aid in health recovery, helping players avoid fainting and, by extension, quest failure regardless of their hunting rank.
 </p>
 <p>
  While numerous healing support items exist in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series, such as potions and megapoints, some are better than others. This is particularly true regarding
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  . For those looking to increase their chances of survival, here are the
  <strong>
   best healing-support items
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds

  and the most recognizable healing-support item in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , the potion, when consumed, generates a small amount of player health. Easily accessible from the start of the game, whether through purchase from a vendor or crafted using honey, potions are the most common healing support item that players will have access to.
 </p>
 <p>
  While invariably useful, potions rank low when compared to other healing-support items - not due to their lack of effectiveness on the battlefield but because of how potent they are as a health-support item. They just yield a small amount of health compared to other items.

   Lifepowder
  </span>
  tops the common potion and is a quintessential healing support item that every player should have in their arsenal. It operates similarly to potions, generating a small amount of health; however, it excels over the potion in terms of functionality in a few ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, life powder is not consumed; it is thrown in the air, offering faster health recovery times compared to the common potion. Secondly, once used, life powder heals nearby players, aiding multiple hunters when they are attempting to take down even the toughest monsters.

  , heals players and nearby allies, granting them a large amount of health upon use. While particularly useful during challenging monster fights, dust of life is expensive to purchase and takes a fair few materials to craft.

  Nevertheless, it is an effective item that the best hunters use to support themselves and their allies when taking down the toughest monsters in

  . For those who can afford it, it's definitely worth the cost.

   Well-done Steak
  </span>
  is more than a delicious treat in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ; it's an unrivaled stamina and health-boosting item. Particularly useful if hunters have skipped a meal before heading out on a hunt, the hearty roast restores a large amount of health and stamina upon being consumed.
 </p>
 <p>
  This healing-support item also boosts health and stamina gauges, allowing hunters to take and do more damage on the battlefield. Due to its dual health and stamina-related effects, the well-done steak ranks slightly higher than the more common healing-support items in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds

   Mega Potion

  This means that hunters can stock up quickly on mega potions (unlike other items, like the well-done steak), whether at camp or on the fly when tracking a monster. The mega potion is a staple of a hunter's healing-support arsenal.

   Mega Armorskin
  </span>
  is a healing support item that boosts a player's defensive capabilities by 25 points across a 30-minute timespan. This item is the best defense-boosting consumable in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , and it's far more potent than the basic armorskin crafted using adamant seeds. Consequently, only the best hunters use mega armorskin to ensure that their armor is fortified to the maximum during the toughest fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  The opposite of mega armorskin, mega demondrug boosts attack power by a staggering amount when in the thick of battle. Mega demondrug provides the best attack power boost in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , giving players the advantage. These items are at the top of their respective classes.

   Ancient Potion
  </span>
  is the
  <strong>
   best healing-support item in
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Consuming this item will maximize the player's health and stamina and extend their gauges for a long period of time. Effectively, the ancient potion combines the best elements of the max potion and the well-done steak while providing a few extra perks - making it a pure powerhouse in healing and support abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every hunter tackling the toughest and most brutal monsters should have an ancient potion to hand. Unfortunately, only one is permitted per bag, so smart use is recommended.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact

  player has shared their stunning Capitano cosplay with the action RPG community, since parading around the grocery store as a Harbinger is something you don’t come across every day.
  <em>

  boasts a rich universe with several colorful characters to bring into the real world through cosplay, with some favorites being Klee, Paimon, Jean, and Venti.

  Previously known as MiHoYo, HoYoverse released the free-to-play gacha game back in 2020, flaunting an anime-styled open world, titled Teyvat, packed with high-octane and magical battle systems, with gameplay being monetized through gacha mechanics.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players have Version 5.5’s new region to look forward to, introducing Natlan which harbors the Great Volcano of Tollan. HoYoverse also confirmed that Varesa and Iansan will take part in the first banner cycle, and Version 5.5 is expected to be released around March 26, 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  Posted on Reddit by Initial_Cellist_3406, a series of photos were shared on the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  subreddit, showcasing a cosplayer dressed head-to-toe as the striking Capitano. What elevated the usual cosplay photoshoot was the setting, which captured Capitano doing his weekly grocery shop. Capitano is a far cry away from
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s cutest characters, as the cosplayer perfectly embodied the character’s ominous anonymity while selecting which meat and beer to purchase at the store. It was very apparent the attention to detail involved in recreating a costume to this flawless standard, between the realistic armor, delicate helm, and the seamless material used to craft the gold and black jacket.

 <p>
  Previous leaks teased the fandom about Capitano becoming a playable character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and discussed the character’s fate in the franchise’s future, but fans were too busy marveling over the real-life cosplay to care about the character’s in-game version. One Redditor noted they would “freak out” upon passing Capitano while shopping, and another created a headcanon where Pantalone gave Capitano money to go grocery shopping.

  The
  <strong>
   Chores
  </strong>
  mod takes the Family Bulletin Board from
  <em>
   Parenthood
  </em>
  to the next level by allowing players to assign specific cleaning duties to household members. With it, players can create a detailed schedule for Sims, designating the days and times when each Sim is responsible for keeping the house tidy. While on duty, Sims will receive an emotion buff that nudges them to clean up messes around the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Sims not on cleaning duty will refrain from tidying up, ensuring that there's plenty for the designated Sim to take care of. This mod enhances family gameplay by adding a layer of realism and responsibility, encouraging Sims to clean their messes themselves. It’s perfect for those who enjoy the micromanagement aspect of family life in
  <em>
   The Sims 4.

  Reward Sims for completing their chores, earning good grades, and positive behavior with the
  <strong>
   Allowance Mod
  </strong>
  . Children and teen Sims can ask their parents or guardians for a weekly allowance. Caregivers can then choose from cheap, low, medium, and high allowance amounts, taking into consideration the child's grades, traits, and character values. Payouts occur twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays.
 </p>
 <p>
  The allowance will be automatically deducted from household funds and stored in the Sim’s personal Allowance Account, accessible from their phone. If behavior slips or finances tighten, caregivers can reduce or revoke the allowance entirely. This mod is perfect for players who want to teach their Sims the value of hard work and money management.

  The
  <strong>
   Call A Babysitter
  </strong>
  mod offers a practical solution for parents and adults in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  who need to step out without their children. Instead of relying on random NPCs to watch over the kids, this mod allows players to handpick a specific Sim — or even several Sims — to come over and take on the babysitting role. Whether it's a trusted family friend, a responsible teen neighbor, or a relative, players have full control over who cares for their little ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  The selected babysitter will be hired for this popular part-time job for 15 Simoleons per hour. This mod enhances family gameplay by giving players more flexibility and personalization in managing their Sims' lives, ensuring that children are cared for by familiar faces, which can deepen relationships and create storyline opportunities within the household.

 <p>
  Every Sims player knows the chaos that comes with raising an infant — constant crying, endless feedings, and the struggle to keep up with their needs. The
  <strong>
   Slow Infant Needs
  </strong>
  mod makes this challenging stage more manageable by halving the rate at which infants' needs decay. This gives parents more time to respond to their baby's needs without feeling overwhelmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this mod, players can embrace the infant life stage instead of rushing to age up their Sim babies. It allows more room to build relationships, focus on skill development, and explore storylines without the constant pressure of meeting every need immediately. Family gameplay becomes more enjoyable and balanced, giving Sims families the opportunity to truly bond with their newest addition.

  The next best thing to a stay-at-home parent career is a new aspiration with helpful rewards after completion. For Sims who dream of supporting their children while staying home, the
  <strong>
   Stay-At-Home Parent Aspiration
  </strong>
  mod is the perfect fit. With four milestones, this mod takes parents from the early days of parenthood to becoming true role models with expert parenting skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they progress, these dedicated parents will get whims to complete tasks like cooking, volunteering, and bonding with their kids, creating deeper connections with their family and earning them satisfaction points to use in the rewards store. Upon completion, Sims gain 2500 Simoleons and unlock the Role Model trait, increasing the speed at which nearby Sims gain positive Character Values. Not only is this trait helpful to parent Sims, but it is also beneficial to the children of these Sims.

  Rather than abandoning Sims in the family after they age up into an elder, make their lives more enriching by attempting the new aspiration from the
  <strong>
   Twilight Years Aspiration
  </strong>
  . This mod encourages seniors to stay active, pursue hobbies, and cherish time with their grandchildren, making their later years vibrant and fulfilling. Completing the aspiration rewards Sims with the Long Lived trait, extending their lifespan so they can savor even more precious moments with their family.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sims who achieve this milestone also receive a 2,500 Simoleon bonus, offering a financial boost as they enjoy their retirement. With this aspiration, players can craft heartwarming family narratives, ensuring that elder Sims live their final years with joy, contentment, and purpose.

  The
  <strong>
   Family Dinner Holiday Tradition
  </strong>
  mod brings a heartwarming element to any holiday in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . With this mod, players can make family gatherings even more special by adding a new tradition: preparing and sharing a grand meal with loved ones. Whether it’s Winterfest or a custom holiday, Sims will complete the tradition when they gather around the table to enjoy a meal together, strengthening family bonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sims with the Family-Oriented, Glutton, or the custom Househusband/Housewife trait will especially love this tradition and feel disappointed if it’s overlooked, while Loner or Paranoid Sims may choose to skip the tradition altogether. It’s a perfect way to enhance family gameplay, making holidays more meaningful and authentic.

This mod introduces a fresh layer of depth to family gameplay, allowing players to craft personalized and dynamic parenting experiences. By reflecting different real-world parenting approaches, it enhances family dynamics, making every interaction feel more meaningful and true to character.

  Realistically, family members don't spend 100% of their time together. Similar to the stay-over function from
  <em>
   Growing Together
  </em>
  , the
  <strong>
   Spend Weekend With
  </strong>
  mod lets specific household members spend a few days with friends or relatives. Whether sending kids to visit their grandparents, teens to stay with a friend, or even pets to another household, this mod makes it easy to coordinate mini-getaways.
 </p>
 <p>
  During their stay, Sims away from the household can improve skills, build relationships, and have their needs met autonomously. This way, players have more time and space to focus on other Sims and storylines. By creating new opportunities for relationships to grow and evolve, this mod brings realism back to family life in
  <em>
   The Sims 4

  Becoming a part of the foster family network, Sims can open their homes to toddlers, children, teens, or pets in need of temporary care with the
  <strong>
   Foster Family
  </strong>
  mod. The existing adoption system in the game is oversimplified and dull, but this mod allows players to provide a safe and nurturing environment for foster Sims and pets, offering them a place to stay until they find their forever home.
 </p>
 <p>
  By taking on the role of a foster parent, players can add depth and purpose to their Sim family's lives, creating opportunities for new relationships and emotional connections. The mod enhances family gameplay by enabling players to experience the rewards and responsibilities of fostering and adoption, adding depth to the stories they can create in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .

  Transitioning from child to teen can feel abrupt in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , where Sims suddenly leap from looking like kids to resembling full-grown adults. The
  <strong>
   Preteen Mod
  </strong>
  simulates an intermediate lifestage, allowing players to bridge the gap between childhood and adolescence. When children age up, they receive the preteen trait, are automatically enrolled in middle school, and are visibly shorter than adults.
 </p>
 <p>
  Preteens experience frequent and fast-moving phases, adding a dynamic element to their development. Additionally, the mod introduces a new hygiene system available for all Sims, where they can apply deodorant, body spray, and body lotion to maintain their scent. This mod provides a more nuanced and realistic approach to growing up and creates interesting challenges for everyone in the household.

  The

  franchise has given players incredible main stories with each game, from the start of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  to the latest title,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
  </em>
  Besides the main story in these RPGs, players have also encountered various companions that have added even more life to these worlds, as well as allowed the player to create bonds with the people they travel with.
 </p>
 <p>
  These companions aren't simply there to keep the player company, as each one of them has had their own personal problems and stories for the player to explore while also dealing with the main quest. Out of them all, however, it's these

  is Neve Gallus, the private investigator who calls Minrathous, especially Dock Town, her home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players help Neve between moments of the main story to get to the bottom of a case in Dock Town that puts her up against a previous rival that she had sent to jail in the past. While completing this story, Neve is shown to start trusting Rook, and her quest line is made even more interesting if the player chooses to save Treviso instead.

 <p>
  Neve isn't the only companion in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  with a great story, as Davrin is another option that many players enjoy. His story is especially intriguing due to it finally marking the return of a Grey Warden companion, with him actually being a Warden instead of pretending to be one. This is only made better through Davrin also having an adorable companion of his own, a Griffon called Assan.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Davrin, players can dig deep into some values of Grey Wardens. The companion's story will also appeal to those who enjoy the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  books, with some characters from them appearing throughout.

  Although players may have encountered Isabela for the first time in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , she became a companion in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  where she followed Hawke around. Even with all the dirty jokes she makes, Isabela has one of the most interesting stories in
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  , as players who don't pay attention or attempt to befriend her may never see her again in the final act.
 </p>
 <p>
  Isabela is holding onto a secret, which is the reason the Qunari invade Kirkwall during the second act of the game. Players who help Isabela to locate what she has lost and continue to support and trust her will receive her trust in return, as Hawke shows her that she can do the right thing. Something must've paid off, as this eventually leads her to create the Lords of Fortune in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard

  Out of all the companions in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: Inquisition
   </em>
  </strong>
  , one of the greatest and most touching companion stories involves Dorian Pavus, a mage from Tevinter. Before meeting this mage, many players were under the impression that those from Tevinter were quite evil, especially regarding certain views and the way people are treated there.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Dorian is unlike his peers, with the player broadening his horizons and inspiring him to make a change back home. Besides this, romancing him adds so much to his story as a companion due to him being a gay man who ran away from home because of how his father reacted. Being forced to meet him again adds another touching element to Dorian that some players may relate to.

  </strong>
  . However, this Anders and the man players meet in

  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Anders' companion story goes hand-in-hand with the main story of

  , as players unknowingly help him blow up the Chantry. However, there is far more to him than just this, as players aid Anders in freeing mages as well as witness how Justice is changing him, which has led some players to justify the actions of this mage.

  <em>

  continues to have some incredible companion stories, with Fenris being another brilliant companion to be introduced in the second game in the franchise. Firstly, Fenris as a character is quite interesting due to his lyrium tattoos. These play heavily into his story at points, especially when romancing him, due to them being sensitive to touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when not romancing Fenris, his story is unbelievable, with players helping him fight the monsters of his past while also encountering tragedy through how much he has forgotten. Playing as a Mage can heighten this story even more, allowing players to show Fenris that not all mages are evil.

  Before Solas was revealed as the Dreadwolf, he was originally just Solas, a companion who followed the Inquisitor in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . Before he was revealed to be a god, interacting with him as a companion was one of the most interesting things a player could do, especially due to all the stories of the past he has to share.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who have played
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  again since completing
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  are sure to enjoy Solas' story even more with this added knowledge of his past, especially once they have made it to the
  <em>
   Trespasser

  DLC.

  Alistair is likely the Hero of Ferelden's closest friend throughout the story of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , due to them both being among the few Grey Wardens remaining since the events of the start of the game. Even while allowing the player to take the center stage most of the time, Alistair's story is one of the best of the franchise, especially due to all the avenues it can take.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alistair is the illegitimate son of a king, and with the previous king – his half-brother – dying, he has a chance of becoming king himself. Naturally, Alistair didn't originally want to become king, but through the help of his friend, the player, it's possible to him decide whether he should attempt this role or continue as a Grey Warden.

  When first encountering Morrigan, many players may not have liked her due to her being quite combative. However, her story is one of the best, not only
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  , but the entire franchise, as this Witch of the Wilds is exploring the world for herself for the first time and finding her independence. She makes the selfless choice of providing a way for the Grey Wardens to survive, which leads to her having her own incredible DLC in
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  that is a must for any who romance her.
 </p>
 <p>
  Morrigan has not only amazed players through her companion story, but she has also done so through how she has continued to be a staple of the game, returning once more in both
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . She continues to play a major role and still feels like a companion even when she can't follow the player around.

  Out of all the companions players have met throughout the

 </p>
 <p>
  During
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2

  , Varric's story played hand-in-hand with Hawke filling the role of closest friend. The story is also the reason red lyrium was found. Varric continues to be relevant in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  due to not only the red lyrium but also for having beaten Corypheus in the past. Even without the main story, Varric is shown wanting a purpose, which the Inquisitor helps him find. He becomes a permanent member of the Inquisition, where he finally gets to be a mentor of sorts for the player in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

      Xilonen boosts Geo character usage, while Neuvillette comes in third as a powerful Hydro DPS.

  An interesting
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  chart has revealed the most used characters in Phase 2 of the Version 5.4 Spiral Abyss. Many consider this
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  domain the hardest piece of content, as it features 12 different floors, each more difficult than the last, with floors 11 and 12 usually being the most challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every floor in the Spiral Abyss contains multiple chambers featuring different types of enemies, meaning players must adapt their parties accordingly. Clearing the Spiral Abyss within a certain time frame grants various rewards, from enhancement materials to precious Primogems.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Reddit user named qri_pretty posted a chart on
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's official subreddit, ranking the playable roster by their usage rate in the current Spiral Abyss phase. According to the post, the most used character, with a usage rate of 96.7%, is the Hydro Archon Furina. This is one of the highest usage rates recorded in the game so far, and it does not come as a big surprise, considering that Furina is currently featured on the Limited Character Banner. Since her official reveal during the Fontaine arc, Lady Furina has been one of the most popular characters due to her power on the field and her overall importance to the main storyline. Many fans consider Furina's Archon Quest the best-written storyline in the game. She is also widely regarded as the best Hydro support in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , thanks to her versatile kit, which allows her to fit into almost any team composition.

 </h2>
 <p>
  The second most used character in the current Spiral Abyss is the Natlan Geo user Xilonen, who has significantly improved the standing of Geo characters in the current
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  meta. For a long time before Xilonen's release, the only Geo character that ranked remotely high on these usage charts was the Liyue Archon, Zhongli. Similar to Kazuha, who ranks fifth on the list, Xilonen can shred enemies' resistances while providing buffs to the entire team.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Unsurprisingly, Furina's Fontaine colleague, Neuvillette, took third place. Neuvillette is regarded as the most powerful Hydro DPS in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  due to his stacked kit, which revolves around his unique Charged Attack that allows him to fire a powerful Hydro beam dealing AoE damage. Neuvillette is also highly flexible and does not require much support in his team compositions. In fact, many players manage to clear the hardest floors of the Abyss with only Neuvillette in their party.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the chart, the second most used Natlan character after Xilonen is the Cryo support Citlali, who was released in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.3. Citlali's release went somewhat under the radar, which is understandable as she debuted alongside arguably the most popular Natlan character, the Pyro Archon Mavuika, who ranks as the sixth most used character on the list.

 <p>
  The opening night of Gamescom introduced fans to a wide range of upcoming projects across the gaming industry, with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mafia: The Old Country
   </strong>
  </em>
  being one of the most surprising. Not counting remakes, this upcoming project will be the first new experience to come to the franchise in close to a decade, and it seems that 2K and Hangar 13 are paying a lot of respect to the foundations of the series in the development of the game.

 <p>
  It is no secret that the
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  franchise has struggled to keep a consistent identity across its mainline games, with 2016's
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  famously adopting a more open approach with a branching narrative as opposed to the more tight-knit and linear stories of past entries. While
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  had its strong points, some fans were disappointed at the core thematic and gameplay-related changes that the release brought to the IP, and it seems that
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  has heard these criticisms loud and clear.

  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  's announcement at Gamescom was a clear statement of intent by Hangar 13, painting a fruitful future for a franchise that has not received a fresh experience since the release of
  <em>
   Mafia: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  in 2020, which itself was a remake of the IP's first title. While this announcement only consisted of a brief cinematic trailer, it is known that
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  will be set during the early 1900s, taking place primarily in Sicily, Italy.

 <p>
  Hangar 13 has also stressed how
  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  will have a particular focus on "authentic realism and rich storytelling," painting a picture of a more close-knit open world with a focus on linear set-pieces and gameplay sequences. An early 1900s setting also makes
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  the earliest-set
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  title, with the original game taking place during the 1930s, meaning the game cannot hide behind the pomp and excess of modern luxuries in its portrayal of turn-of-the-century Sicily.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  stands out quite starkly from its two predecessors in the themes and core narrative it explores, telling the fascinating story of Vietnam War veteran Lincoln Clay during the late 1960s. While different Mafia families do play prominent roles in the story of
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  , they largely exist as antagonist organizations, with Lincoln being entirely removed from them. Some fans felt this went against the
  <em>
   Goodfellas
  </em>
  -esque drama and intrigue of past franchise entries, and this is something that
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  is seemingly going to be much more in line with.

  Mafia: The Old Country Explores the Origins of What Makes the Franchise Tick
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  is aiming to go to the roots of the Mafia as a concept, with Sicily being the founding location of the first Mafia organizations, otherwise known as the Cosa Nostra. Even from the brief trailer for the game, it seems clear that the game is going to great lengths to portray the original traditions and practices of these early Mafia organizations, with this attention to detail potentially exceeding what fans saw in the first
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mafia 2
  </em>
  .

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  could still potentially tie itself to other games in the franchise by showing the origins of the Mafia families that exist in past games, but its major shift in location seems indicative of a gritty standalone experience. While the ambitious gameplay and story changes that
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  featured were still well received, there will always be demand for a more traditional
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  experience, and
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  has clearly been developed with this tradition in mind.

  Behaviour Interactive has announced the latest changes coming to the live servers of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead by Daylight
   </strong>
  </em>
  . After the test run of Update 8.2.0 on the Public Test Build, the developers behind
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  are making a few more tweaks as the changes get ready to drop for all players.

 <p>
  In the asymmetrical horror game
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , one player takes on the role of a killer while four others act as survivors attempting to escape. The game features a wide range of iconic horror legends and is constantly adding new faces to its roster. In the most recent update to
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Public Test Build, several changes were made to killers specifically, alongside a new survivor and killer being added to the game.

 <p>
  After running the 8.2.0 update on the Public Test Build for some time, these changes are now ready to hit the live servers of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight.
  </em>
  While a majority of what was tested on the PTB is being transferred over to the live servers, a few killers and perks are receiving some minor tweaks ahead of the live update. Announced on Behaviour Interactive's latest Reddit blog post, The Dark Lord, The Nemesis, and The Knight are receiving a few minor updates to their powers and cooldowns. A majority of these changes also provide minor buffs to these characters.

 <p>
  Alongside this, a couple of new
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  perks are also getting some changes before making it to the live release of update 8.2.0. The new Dark Lord perk, Human Greed, will get a cooldown buff that adjusts the time between uses. Finally, the Trevor Belmont perk, Exultation, will be losing a minor feature that prevents players from keeping upgraded items at the end of trials. Now, survivors will get to keep the upgraded items that they risked their lives to get during the trial.

      A WWE 2K24 glitch surprises players during a Sheamus vs. Gunther match, freezing the two in an unorthodox hold mid-attack.

      Fans compared the strange glitch to an iconic moment from Titanic, dubbing it "The Titanic Lock" for comedic effect.

  Anything can happen in the world of professional wrestling, and one
  <strong>
   <em>
    WWE 2K24
   </em>
  </strong>
  player recently chanced across an unusual glitch during a seemingly ordinary match between Sheamus and Gunther. Released back in March,
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  has been praised by many as one of the best entries in quite some time, thanks in no small part to its array of gameplay modes like the WrestleMania-centric 2K Showcase, two MyRise campaigns, and improved MyFaction mode.

 <p>
  <em>
   WWE 2K
  </em>
  players have also seen their fair share of bugs and glitches during matches over the years, especially in the notoriously bug-ridden
  <em>
   WWE 2K20
  </em>
  . In that particular entry, objects would inexplicably phase through the ring, the arena would suddenly start shaking mid-match, and character models would be warped beyond recognition. While later entries like
  <em>
   WWE 2K22
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  have smoothed out the worst of these issues, players have still encountered strange glitches while performing flying leaps off the top turnbuckle or wrestling in a steel cage match.

  Reddit user Melodic_Cook60 recently chanced across an incredibly strange glitch while playing
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  , one that they soon shared a video clip of on r/WWEGames. They were wrestling against Gunther as Sheamus, and about to unleash the Celtic Warrior’s finishing move on the reigning WWE World Heavyweight champion when their character suddenly froze mid-attack. Sheamus seemingly held Gunther’s arms in place as the camera and in-game commentators acted as if a standard wrestling move was being performed, with Gunther apparently surrendering the match after a brief time in this unorthodox hold.

  In the comment section of the Reddit post this clip was shared on, users humorously compared Sheamus’ new “move” with the iconic moment from
  <em>
   Titanic
  </em>
  where Jack holds Rose at the bow of the ship at sunset, with one of them even calling it “The Titanic Lock.” Others note that they would rather have amusing
  <em>
   WWE 2K
  </em>
  glitches like this instead of more serious ones that cost them a match, such as an opponent successfully performing a move despite the player hitting a reversal.

  Glitches like this are par for the course in the
  <em>
   WWE 2K
  </em>
  series, which will be getting a new installment sometime next year. There is no word on
  <em>
   WWE 2K25
  </em>
  ’s exact launch date, but wrestling fans think that an official reveal will come during next January’s Royal Rumble event. While the new game will likely be more technically polished than
  <strong>
   <em>
    WWE 2K24
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players could see a few more surprising glitches like Sheamus’s new cinema-inspired finisher crop up within the squared circle.

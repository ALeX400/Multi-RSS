  A talented
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has recreated the Razor Crest starship from
  <em>
   The Mandalorian
  </em>
  in Bethesda’s open-world space RPG. Since
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  was released in September 2023, Bethesda has issued monthly patches and new content to keep players engaged with its latest RPG.

 <p>
  On June 9, Bethesda released the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  Creation Kit for both PC and Xbox Series X/S ​much to the surprise of many fans. The Creation Kit allows players to design and implement their mods into the game and opens up an almost infinite number of possibilities with what players can achieve during their time in the game. To this end, one fan has utilized some mods within the Creator Kit and designed a new ship based on Disney’s hit
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  TV show.

 <p>
  A YouTuber by the name of CyberVinLouis has built the Razor Crest as a VTOL ship using
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ’s detailed shipbuilder. Throughout the video, players are given a detailed rundown of the parts and mods used, along with where the parts can be found within
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ’s galaxy. Several locations including Red Mile, New Atlantis, Akila City, and Neon are on the list of places gamers can expect to travel to to gain the relevant parts for the Razor Crest. Comments to the video are understandably positive, with most fans seeming to be enamored with the level of detail found in the video.

  The Razor Crest is the latest in a long line of unofficial
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  mods that have made their way into
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  since its release, and thanks to the release of the Creator Kit, the number of mods based on a galaxy far far away has grown exponentially over the last few weeks. Players can now find various items from the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe including Jedi outfits and AT-ST enemies, and a few creative souls have even replaced certain NPCs with the colorful aliens from Lucasfilm’s iconic franchise.

  Most recently, one player added lightsabers to

  Thanks to the dedication of players like CyberVinLouis,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  continues to carve out a committed community. This passion from the fans has seemingly paid dividends as the game’s director, Todd Howard, confirmed players can expect yearly

  expansions starting with the long-awaited Shattered Space DLC that is currently aiming for a release in Fall 2024.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has caught a hundo Slaking with an astounding combat power of 5069, which is the highest possible in the game. Combat Power is essentially a metric in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  that determines how strong or weak a Pokemon is, and it is also used as a restriction in GO Battle League to create diverse playing fields.

 <p>
  Players are often looking to catch some rare Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , with hundos and shundos being two of the most sought Pokemon. Hundos are Pokemon with perfect IV stats, while shundos are the shiny variants of those Pokemon. Most of the time, players are looking to catch these variants of Pokemon that are quite powerful in battles or tied to events. However, one
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player has had a rather unique encounter.

 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  subreddit, a fan showcases an incredibly rare Pokemon they caught. The player caught a hundo Slaking in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , with a staggering combat power of 5069. While the Pokemon being a hundo is one of the interesting parts of the incident, considering how rare they are, the fact that it is also the highest possible CP a Pokemon can have in the game serves as the icing on the cake. That is, of course, keeping aside mega-evolved Pokemon, which get a CP buff. The user goes on to figuratively state they have completed the game, emphasizing how significant the catch was.

 <p>
  In fact, Slaking is the only non-mega Pokemon that can even get past 5,000 CP. Considering that it even surpasses legendaries and mythical Pokemon to reach that stature, it is quite a feat, to say the least. The closest another Pokemon comes is Regigigas, which maxes out at 4913 CP. There is quite a significant gap after that, as the next highest is Mewtwo, with 4724 CP. When it comes to megas, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Rayquaza are the ones that dominate the CP charts.

 <p>
  That being said, it is not really a powerful Pokemon to have as such. In fact, one user states that they deliberately didn't level up their Slaking so it doesn't become the Pokemon in their collection with the most combat power in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . While some players requested the original poster to not put them in gyms, others stressed that it might not be that difficult to defeat them despite their incredibly high CP.

 <p>
  While Slaking is a good attacker in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , it is actually a weak Pokemon defensively. Not to forget, its fast moves aren't that effective as well, as it only has the move Yawn, which deals no damage at all. Its extremely high CP also causes it to lose motivation extremely fast. Whether it is effective or not, the player has definitely got some bragging rights with their rare catch.

  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  has shattered its prior concurrent player record, which was established less than four months prior. The online gaming juggernaut shows no signs of slowing down, and this Steam player record offers one more indication as to how PC gaming is increasing in popularity.

 <p>
  Steam was established long before most online gaming platforms, as it was initially intended as a method of distributing Valve games and updates in the early 2000s. Over time, it gradually morphed into a marketplace for nearly every kind of game imaginable, and has retained extreme popularity despite competitors like Origin and Epic Games Store coming to challenge it. Now, the PC gaming platform has set yet another record for itself.

 <p>
  According to SteamDB, Steam shattered yet another concurrent player record for itself, this time nearly reaching 37 million active players (36,928,521) on Sunday, June 30. Back in March, Steam broke its own record twice, initially hitting 34 million concurrent players and then surpassing it a week later with 36 milion users. While Valve releases very few games of its own anymore, Steam has continued to expand its reach to gamers all over the world. This market share has only increased further with the release of the Steam Deck, as even gamers without game-compatible PCs can utilize Steam's massive game library.

 <h2 id="why-did-steam-break-another-player-record">
  Why Did Steam Break Another Player Record?
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are likely a few factors to thank for Steam reaching this new concurrent player record. The first is that the Summer Steam Sale is currently going on, which offers one of the best opportunities for gamers to get titles at major discounts. The last time Steam broke its own record, it was holding the smaller Spring Steam Sale, so it stands to reason that is a major contributing factor.

 <p>
  Another element to consider is that the summer brings lots of major gaming events, updates, and releases with it.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  have both received major expansions in recent days,
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  launched a new bounty hunter update, and numerous games are entering or recently entered a new season. Meanwhile, Valve's most recent release,
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  , is still seeing tons of players on its own.

 <p>
  It seems like it's only a matter of time before Steam ends up crashing through 40 million concurrent players. While it could still be a long time before that happens, the Winter Steam Sale seems like a likely time for Steam to set a new record for itself.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has created a concept that makes the Fletching Table usable by players.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has an impressive variety of blocks players can use to make different items. But while some blocks are available to players, some are used by villagers, adding a new layer of entertainment to Mojang's sandbox.

 <p>
  Job site blocks are a special type of block for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  villagers. Once it claims a block, the villager will take on the profession related to it. An example is the villager who becomes a butcher by claiming a Smoker, and from then on it trades meats, sweet berries, rabbit stew, and dried kelp blocks. Another workplace block is the Fletching Table, which turns the villager into a Fletcher, who trades bows, crossbows, arrows, and archery ingredients. Recently, a
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  player shared an interesting idea that would make this block much better.

 <p>
  Reddit user PowerPork shared a concept that would allow
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players to use a Fletching Table, something that is not possible. The player's idea consists of an interface with four slots in which the player can place items to use the Fletching Table. The first three slots are for a feather, stick, and flint, while the fourth slot will result in a normal arrow if left empty. If the player fills the fourth slot with valid material, it will be possible to craft special arrows.

  The OP's concept includes a simpler recipe for creating tipped arrows, making the item accessible before fighting the Ender Dragon, and a cheaper recipe for spectral arrows. They also created new arrows in which, instead of the player putting a potion in the fourth slot, they would put nether quartz, redstone, honey, Amethyst, and Echo Shards. The player also shared arrow ideas "which they don't know if would fit in the game," such as flaming arrows, arrows made of gold and iron, and carrot arrows that "would do a million damage if they hit a rabbit."

  In the comments section, other
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players praised PowerPork's idea. Some comments asked about the possibility of the Redditor creating a mod based on the concept, and although they said they didn't know how to program, another player offered to turn the idea into a mod.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has a variety of mods related to archery. With the immense creativity of the players, it wouldn't be surprising to see this inventive concept become a mod with the help of other members of the

  community.

  The Realm Of Shadow in
  <em>
   <strong>

  is an expansive map, but players will have the ability to explore just about all of it early on as long as they know where to go. The main goal of the DLC and finding the final boss will require players to explore a lot of the realm, but there will still be other locations that are purely optional.

  The Finger Ruins of Rhia are located in the
  <strong>
   southeastern section of the map
  </strong>
  but are found before the Jagged Peak. To reach this location, players will first need to get to the Cerulean Coast. From the Cerulean Coast Cross site of grace, head up the small hill just to the north, and look off to the east. Here, players can see a beach covered mostly in water leading to the ruins.

  Mount Torrent and use him to drop down to the areas below until you reach the beach. There will be a beach further east that leads to the ruins, with players able to
  <strong>
   run through the water directly to the far beach
  </strong>
  . Despite the inability to see below the water, the entire path straight to the other beach is shallow enough to walk on. On the other beach, be wary of finger spiders and head up the

   large stone coffin and off the back right corner
  </strong>
  to enter the Finger Ruins of Rhia.

  All the fingers within the ruins curl towards the very center. Ride Torrent through the ruins and avoid the various enemies found in the area. Be wary of those who cast spells, as being hit with the purple balls of energy will stun you and leave you open to a critical hit from an approaching enemy. At the

   very center of the ruins

  will be a stone structure players can interact with, which will sound the bell and give players the Talisman. This Talisman makes every charge in the

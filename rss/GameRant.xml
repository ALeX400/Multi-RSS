  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  is making a major change to the way the Amazon-owned streaming platform calculates its requirements to obtain partner status, now including viewership from raids from other channels. The massively popular streaming platform has seen plenty of changes in recent years to make a positive impact on its talents, shipping out a plethora of helpful features. Twitch rolled out new updates to its clipping system last month, offering the ability for users to easily make "portrait" versions of their clips and promising future upgrades. Now, one of Twitch's exclusive statuses is getting a big change.

 <p>
  Twitch's Partner system serves as one of the main ways for streamers on the platform to monetize their content. In order for streamers to be eligible for Partner status, Twitch requires that its creators stream for at least 25 hours across at least 12 different days while maintaining an average of 75 viewers. Twitch also features programs like "Partner Plus" offering even better incentives for some of the streaming site's most popular content creators. A new update is now making it even easier for more creators to obtain Partner status.

 <p>
  According to a recent statement made by Angela from Twitch's Global Partners Operation Team, Twitch has recently rolled out a change to its Partner eligibility requirements. The post reveals that Twitch now includes raids from other users in its statistics for Partner consideration, opening up the status to even more streamers. Angela cites not wanting to "punish networking and communities" from Twitch in its decision to change the requirements, potentially helping smaller communities build each other up.

 <p>
  The new changes to Twitch's Partner program come as the popular streaming platform has recently seen major changes among its top creators. Popular VTuber Ironmouse recently broke a Twitch record during her ongoing subathon, surpassing Kai Cenat for the highest subscriber count in the platform's history. Twitch even congratulated Ironmouse through the platform's official Twitter account, with the streamer planning to donate half of the proceeds from the subathon to the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Kai Cenat has also made major moves recently, rumored to be collaborating with McDonald's in the near future.

 <p>
  Twitch's adjustments to the Partner program will hope to entice more users to the platform as the site has seen multiple major talents coming back. Several popular content creators like LilyPichu and Myth have made their return to Twitch throughout recent months, after previously receiving major deals to leave the platform for YouTube. Many returning streamers have cited Twitch's better revenue splits and superior chat features as major reasons for returning to the Amazon streaming site. Twitch could be experiencing a major renaissance with big-name talents coming back and a wider range for its Partner Program.

      <title>Star Wars Outlaws’ Hutt Reputation Misses a Rancor-Sized Opportunity When It Matters Most</title>

  thrives when players are taking their time and indulging in each open-world planet’s tinier beats as well as interactions with criminal syndicates. Indeed,
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  ’ gratifying reputation system is rich with rewards and allowances, and it’s fantastic seeing which factions hold dominance in a planet as represented by district and hideout zones throughout. This can fully recontextualize the decision-making process when players are repeatedly asked which syndicates to gain favor with, such as whether they’ll need to access a certain area and can do so freely as long as they have a Good reputation with them.

  The Pykes and Crimson Dawn are more or less ubiquitous in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  as players can bump into them in several places while the Hutts and Ashiga are a bit more particular in where they choose to hole up. It’s obvious that the Hutt Cartel will have its biggest presence on Tatooine since that’s where Jabba’s palace is, for example, and anyone who’s watched the original
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  trilogy will have some understanding of how intimidating that presence is. Sadly, the Hutts and their reputation don’t amount to as much in gameplay as they need to, even if the right pieces are in place to have the palace’s epic moment in the story be impactful.

  Entering Jabba’s palace to rescue Nix covertly seems novel to a degree until players come across Jabba himself in the throne room. Here, the scene plays out almost identically to how it goes for Luke Skywalker in
  <em>
   Return of the Jedi
  </em>
  <em>
   —
  </em>
  Kay Vess is dropped into the rancor pit below, though she’s accompanied by the bounty hunter-turned-friend Vail and a soon-dead Hoss.

 <p>
  After defeating a pack of massiffs in this claustrophobic and iconic hole, a loud thud can be heard against the metal gate before players. The rancor’s release is anticipated, and yet it never occurs—rather, Kay and Vail are free to leave. It’s only when they’ve reached the throne room’s sail barge hangar that a rancor boss fight is finally initiated and centers more around dodging than actually attacking.

     This is disappointing for a number of reasons, but the greatest of which is that it is scripted to happen this way regardless of how exceptional Kay’s reputation with the Hutts was at the time and consequently diminishes the system as a whole regarding its narrative implications.

 <p>
  Considering how anticlimactic and basic the ensuing palace hangar fight arguably is, it would’ve been neat if the rancor being unleashed on Kay was a consequence of players having a Bad reputation with the Hutts when they reach that point in the story. Hutt reputation actually goes down following this boss fight with players needing to increase it again before getting to return to the palace, ensuring that a high reputation with the Hutts is narratively worthless when it comes to the whole Jabba sequence.

     It could’ve been exciting to see the rancor not unleashed on players at all if they had a Good or Excellent reputation as if Kay’s loyalty and work toward the Hutts hadn’t gone overlooked or underappreciated by Jabba.

 <p>
  Moreover, the rancor being unleashed if players had a Poor or worse reputation would’ve made sense as Jabba could be happy to dispose of someone who hasn’t shown any dedication to the cartel. However, even if it would’ve made more sense narratively, the rancor being scripted to a lower-end reputation would’ve meant that players are locked out of exciting content if they managed to secure a Good or Excellent reputation with the Hutt Cartel beforehand.

 <p>
  Players would have to either intentionally or inadvertently have a lackluster reputation with the Hutts by the time they get to Jabba’s palace and that wouldn’t feel organic unless players were already devoted to gaining reputation with the Pykes, Crimson Dawn, or Ashiga instead and those efforts all contributed to their Hutt reputation rapidly declining somehow. Either way, Kay’s reputation with the Hutts not mattering much in this scenario is another example of how

   The Veilguard
  </em>
  's Steam Discussions forum, have lately been flooded with criticism about the fourth entry in the long-running franchise being "woke." Some of the posters contributing to this wave of complaints seem to have taken issue with
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's companions being canonically pansexual, arguing that this attempt at offering diverse romance options robs them of personality. Others appear to be irked by the game's diverse cast of characters for various stated reasons.

  Dragon Age Creator Says the Series Has Always Been 'Woke'
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series creator David Gaider has recently opted to respond to some of these complaints by remarking how "the usual suspects are upset at how 'woke' the new Dragon Age is, an apparently sudden and unexpected development in the series." Following up on that train of thought, the industry veteran called the people who spread this sentiment "f*****g tourists" in a recent Bluesky post. The label was meant to imply that these critics are falsely presenting themselves as
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  fans, who would know that the series could have been categorized as "woke" from its very first entry, which hit the market back in 2009.

  In a subsequent interaction with another Bluesky user, Gaider clarified that he has no issues with people liking or disliking whatever they have seen from the upcoming
  <em>

  game so far. His comment was instead merely intended to counter the notion that
  <em>

  introduces a new level of "wokeness" to the franchise.​​​

  While the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series has always been fairly inclusive, it started out before the word "woke" was even part of the widespread English vernacular, and long before it was adopted as a sarcastic pejorative for anything perceived as progressive. This could help explain why the first three mainline installments weren't as polarizing, as they debuted at a time when widespread online culture wars of this sort were simply not a thing.

  's development, as he departed from BioWare back in 2016.

  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  users have picked up on a visual design flaw related to the alignment of text and icons that is almost impossible to disregard once noticed. Since its inception in 2003, Steam's UI has transformed dramatically over the years with multiple overhauls taking place, but its most recent design appears to include an error that isn't exactly serious, but it is most certainly annoying.

  In 2023, Valve celebrated Steam's 20th birthday. When the platform first launched in 2003, it was primarily used to deploy new game updates for various Valve titles, but the company said that its ultimate goal was to "give any game developer a way to reach their players and build their audience." Just two years later,
  <em>
   Rag Doll Kung Fu
  </em>
  became the very first non-Valve game to launch on the platform. The rest, as they say, is history, as Steam is now one of the most popular digital storefronts on the market.

  Over on Reddit, a Steam user is shedding light on a UI design flaw that can be easily missed but will forever be noticeable. Next to every game on Steam is the title's release date, a Windows logo to reflect the game's compatibility, and various genre tags corresponding to the type of game. However, the user realized that none of the three elements align with each other vertically. Although
  <em>
   Dark Souls: Remastered
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  were used as examples, a quick glance at Steam shows that this occurs with every game on the platform, and fans aren't happy.

 <p>
  The response from Steam users has been as expected, with many jokingly stating that they will "never unsee this," while others are speculating on how Valve could have messaged up the alignment so badly. Reddit user Kamui_Kan speculates that both the text and tags are aligned vertically, but the Windows icon wasn't created centered. "Or that the way it's rendered on the web page adds some padding, making it offset," the user went on to explain.

 <p>
  Another Reddit user by the name of BlackHazeRus even noted that the gap between the release date text and the Windows icon is drastically bigger than the gap between the genre tags and the Windows icon, which some found to be even more frustrating. While this gained plenty of traction on Reddit, garnering almost 5,000 upvotes, it's unlikely that Steam will take the time to fix this issue anytime soon, as the studio has plenty of other projects it is working on at the moment.

  Although players will never be able to unsee this annoying design flaw, Steam does add new features on a regular basis to keep the platform as one of the most popular digital storefronts in gaming. The most recent update added Steam Families, a new feature that allows users to share their games with their family members. Even if another family member is online and playing a game, other members can still jump into the shared library.

  Coming in with over seventy-five customization options, the Übermacht Zion Classic offers a lot for a player to choose from. Customize everything from one bumper to the other. This car is also relatively cheap and will only run a player around eight hundred thousand.

 <p>
  Considering some cars are well over a million dollars, the Zion Classic offers a lot for only a little. Players who want to purchase this car can find it on the Southern S.A. Super Autos website. Take it to car shows and show off this beauty.

 <p>
  Turn the Weeny Dynasty into a dream car or turn it into a taxi. Paint it yellow, slap on a taxi sign, and take it to the streets. Unfortunately, players will not be picking people up in the car unless they use it for transport missions.

 <p>
  If taxi driving isn't what the player is looking for, then put one of the other crazy liveries on it. There are eighty-four customization options to choose from after purchasing the Dynasty and a ton of different looks can be achieved. This car will also only cost the player a measly four hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

  With the Benefactor Schlagen GT, players can take the abstract route and customize the vehicle to look as crazy as they are. They can also choose the standard route and bring out the vehicle's inner race car or equip it with a standard stripe and call it a day.

 <p>
  The Schlagen GT offers players a total of eighty-six customization options at the cost of a modest one million three hundred thousand dollars. It might be a bit more than others on the list, but it comes with more options to choose from and more horsepower for players who like fast cars.

  The Annis Savestra can be turned into the race car of any player's dreams with some great liveries and tons of customization options. This car breaks into the nineties with the number of modifications it has. This car has a total of ninety-two mods that players can take advantage of.

 <p>
  These mods cover every aspect of the vehicle and can take it to the next level. This is one of the cheaper options when it comes to great cars in the game and will only run the player a little shy of a million dollars. A great deal for the number of mods players get.

  Taking a Formula 1 car to the dangerous streets of Los Santos surely proves that this player has a death wish, or just loves flexing the amount of money that they have in GTA Online. With the Progen PR4, players can live out the dream of being a true speed racer, as the intense speeds and traction will have them zooming through the streets, albeit, with recklessness and a flimsy design to make the vehicle break if it gets clipped by another car.

  If players want to pull out the most potential from the PR4, then they can upgrade it, as well as provide it with plenty of aesthetic choices, like a sponsored livery, or other colors to showcase the wheel and the drive itself, provided that money won't be an issue.

  The Annis 300R is a sleek and stunning Sports car perfect for cruising around Los Santos. Taking inspiration from various Annis vehicles and mashing them into one magnum opus, the Annis 300R proves a visually stunning ride, but it is much more than just a flashy means of showing off. This car, in addition to its vast selection of cosmetic options, has access to a Missile Lock-On Jammer, Remote Control Unit, Slick Mines, and Armor Plating, truly making it an ideal ride for the tumultuous and unpredictable streets of Los Santos.

 <p>
  The Annis 300R is more than a highly customizable car with a minimum of 100 personalization options but is a dependable and well-rounded vehicle. It can keep up with other mid-tier Sports cars like the Karin Calico GTF while handling notably well. Take its access to weapons, customizability, and overall reliability, and you have a vehicle well worth the price for collectors and enthusiasts. The only downside is that the Annis 300R is a limited-time vehicle that comes off and on the market, so grab it the next opportunity you get.

  There is nothing wrong with choosing to go with a car that resembles a modern Ford Mustang. After all, many people love the design of this great vehicle. Little do people realize, however, that the Vapid Dominator GTX is filled with customization options to play around with.

 <p>
  In total, the Dominator GTX has over one hundred mods for players to choose from. Unfortunately, players who like liveries will be disappointed in this vehicle. However, other mods are well worth the seven hundred thousand dollar price take.

  Yeah, players can take the Weeny Issi Classic and turn it into a war machine to take into battle in the arena war game mode, but that is a waste. Without taking it to the arena, the Issi Classic has over one hundred customization options.

  Players who choose the arena war versions of this car will surely miss out on some great designs like the wooden roof, great liveries, and cool features this car has to offer. All of it comes at a small cost as well of only three hundred and sixty thousand.

  The Pfister Comet Safari gets some great customizations that other vehicles on the list don't get. Players can change the hood to have tools on it, add extra lights to the roof, and even equip some mounted machine guns on the front. The liveries can help get this vehicle to the next level.

 <p>
  This is one of the few cars that players can get outside of Arena War and Warstock Cache &amp; Carry that can be useful in battle. It also only costs a mere seven hundred thousand. Far cheaper than other armed vehicles.

  The Declasse Tulip M-100 is the quintessential taxi turned into a trusty and nostalgic ride with the potential to become much more than the bland car fit only for taxi drivers. Players can make this somewhat disappointing car a fully-fledged Muscle or racecar, with access to the signature stripes and options of vehicles like the Bravado Gauntlet Classic Custom or Karin Calico GTF. Once an imaginative player with some cash gets their hands on the Declasse Tulip M-100, they can make it unrecognizable from the people-toting, stain-covered mess it was.

 <p>
  The Declasse Tulip M-100 has at least 125 customization options, all of which afford players many enjoyable ways of modding their rides. They can lean towards the vehicle's class by making an eye-catching and tough Muscle car that puts others to shame, or they can create a vehicle for drag or street racing, complete with flashy designs and sponsors slapped across its body. Regardless, whatever they do, they will have an outstanding Muscle car only second to the Declasse Vigero ZX in terms of overall efficiency, as the Declasse Tulip M-100 is a notably fast vehicle that handles well.

  The Annis ZR350 makes a return from
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
  </em>
  Back in the day, players considered this car the best that
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  had to offer. This new vehicle from the Tuner update will cost players $1,600,000 or $1,200,000 for the trade price.

  Like other vehicles on the list, the ZR350 comes packed with customization options for players to try out. It also offers great acceleration and speed while at the same time being pretty damage-resistant.

 <p>
  For the first time in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  history, players can finally live out their dreams of owning a police car without the need to steal it or using glitches. The Gauntlet Interceptor is easily the best of the bunch thanks to its high stats and speeds, but what really makes it stand out, is the variety of customization options finally available to players who have wanted to get their hands on their own personal police car for over a decade.

 <p>
  Whilst the cost of the vehicle is mouth-watering, players who have been here from the start will know that money isn't an issue in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . When players do grab this car, they can head over to upgrade it, changing the grille, exhaust, and pretty much everything about the car, but the bonus customization options come from the police equipment, like tech arrays, searchlights, emergency lighting, pushbars, and more.

  Another car that will run players a little less than a million dollars is the Karin 190z. This great car gives players access to the most customization options in the game. For interested players, the total number of mods for this car is over one hundred and fifty.

  With such an extensive number of options, players can turn the 190z into whatever they want it to be. A car like this is one that any player who loves customization should purchase. This car can be found on the Legendary Motorsport website.

  The Överflöd Entity MT is an elegant and striking car with one goal and one goal alone, speed. And while it certainly achieves this, it also succeeds in being one of the most customizable vehicles players can acquire. With a minimum of 175 customization options and much more, it can meet every player's particular tastes and preferences with various designs and paints. Where the Överflöd Entity MT shines is the option for it to receive a Hao's Special Works Performance Upgrade, granting it access to various visual, performance, and countermeasure options.

 <p>
  The Överflöd Entity MT, alongside its many customization options, is an outstanding Super that boasts many characteristics that make it more than a flashy car, but a viable vehicle for traversing Los Santos or racing. It is the fastest Super in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  and shines overall, making it one of the best Supers in the game. While it does come at a hefty price, the Överflöd Entity MT is a more reasonable purchase than other Supers, as players will more than likely take it for rides rather than letting it sit in their garage as a glorified decoration.

  A great classic vehicle for both speed and customization, the Bravado Gauntlet Classic Custom has over two-hundred customization options for players to enjoy. Some of the best include the liveries. Players can paint their Gauntlet Classic Custom with liveries akin to that of race cars.

  Players can even go with the classic hot rod flame design if they want to spice up their look on the road. This car costs six hundred and fifteen thousand unless the player unlocks the trade price which will cost them four hundred and sixty-one thousand.

  Who remembers the
  <em>
   Fast &amp; Furious
  </em>
  films? Well, the Annis Euros is
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online's
  </em>
  version of the Drift King's Car from
  <em>
   Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift.
  </em>
  It even has a nice replica livery to boot.

  This is one of the more modern vehicles from the Tuner update and will cost players $1,800,000 or $1,350,000 for the trade price. It may be expensive, but it is also one of the best drift cars from the update. The Euros also has great acceleration and above-average speed.

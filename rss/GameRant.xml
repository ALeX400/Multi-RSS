  The
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series is renowned for including a vast array of historical cameos, from Benjamin Franklin to Napoleon and a fair few in between. But some of the series' most ingenious integrations of history are when major real-world events are woven throughout an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game's main story. For instance,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  sees players partake in the Boston Tea Party,
  <em>
   AC Odyssey
  </em>
  sees players fight in the Battle of Themopylae, and
  <em>
   AC Unity
  </em>
  sees players escape from the eponymous prison during the Storming of the Bastille.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  ' story has plenty of similar moments.

  Beginning in the year 1581,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is set at the tail end of the Sengoku period, an era of near-constant conflict and civil war among Japan's daimyos and clans. The start of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' story follows Oda Nobunaga's war to unify Japan, which is suddenly cut short by an event known as the Hanno-ji Incident, which players get to witness first-hand.

  Setting The Stage for Betrayal
 </h3>
 <p>
  Having just decimated the Takeda clan, Oda Nobunaga had become the most powerful single daimyo in all of Japan by the year 1582. In an attempt to seize control of Japan in its entirety, Nobunaga sent his top generals to invade each of central Japan's key provinces, which had already been weakened greatly by their own various internal conflicts and wars with other hostile clans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Believing his ultimate goal of unifying Japan was finally within reach, Nobunaga returned to Kyoto. Upon hearing that the Mori clan had higher numbers than were first thought, Nobunaga sent Akechi Mitsuhide to bolster his forces in the Chogoku region. Nobunaga planned to join them, but first he would rest at Hanno-ji, a nearby Buddhist temple.
 </p>
 <h3 id="the-death-of-oda-nobunaga">
  The Death of Oda Nobunaga
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the vast majority of his army and generals fighting in distant regions, Oda Nobunaga had little protection in his own capital. Akechi Mitsuhide wasted no time in acting upon this temporary weakness. Mitsuhide marched his 13,000-strong army into Hanno-ji temple, and Nobunaga's minimal defense was no match.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within just two hours, Akechi Mitsuhide's siege of Hanno-ji temple was complete. The walls surrounding the temple were decimated, and the temple itself was burned to the ground. Oda Nobunaga's body lay inside, lifeless, with the betrayed daimyo having committed seppuku.

  Assassin's Creed Shadows' Interpretation of the Hanno-ji Incident
 </h3>
 <p>
  A few hours into
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , player-character Naoe is summoned to a meeting with Akechi Mitsuhide at his castle. Here, Naoe is told that Oda Nobunaga is the head of the Shinbakufu organization that killed her father, and she agrees to help Mitsuhide bring an end to Nobunaga's reign.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naoe sneaks behind Oda Nobunaga's defense at Hanno-ji with ease and confronts the daimyo while Mitsuhide's forces attack. Nobunaga tells Naoe that she's been deceived by Mitsuhide, that he was the one who killed her father, not him. Distraught, Naoe leaves the temple as it burns. Oda Nobunaga commits seppuku, with Yasuke performing the role of assistant, reluctantly severing his master's spinal cord.

  A gamer has shared their attempt to create the same person in both
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    InZOI
   </strong>
  </em>
  , with stark differences emerging between the two. The creations highlight how big a difference there is between both the graphical fidelity and the style of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  is considered to be one of the only games that's come along in recent times that might be able to challenge
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  for its life simulation game throne. While there are certainly differences between
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  in terms of gameplay and content, long-time fans of
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  seem to be eager to see a competitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, a Reddit user going by whyareyougee has shared their attempt at creating the same character in both
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Whyareyougee split the images in half, so that others can see exactly how they measure up. While the attempt to create the same person is obvious, the differences are tremendous, and they're not because of a shortcoming on the OP's part. While the Sim and the Zoi feature the same general facial structure, there are massive differences between the two. The Sim has less detailed textures overall, with an especially fuzzy-looking tattoo on his neck standing out. The Sim has considerably less detailed hair, especially noticeable around the hairline and the eyebrows, and the Sim's eyes look far more cartoony than the Zoi's. Overall, the difference in lighting is dramatic, with natural shadows being cast on the Zoi, while they're largely absent on the Sim.

 <p>
  Players of both games have quickly shared their opinions, with many expressing how impressed they are with
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  's graphics in general. Some have pointed out that a graphical disparity is to be expected considering that
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  originally launched over a decade prior to
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  . Others have also noted that
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  is intended to have a stylized, cartoonish appearance, and that there's room for both types of esthetics.

 <p>
  While many
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  fans are already checking out
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , one fan pointed out a potential hiccup that could keep players in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  : insufficient hardware specs. A player lamented that their older computer simply can't handle
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , but that
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  still plays well on their system. Since
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  was designed to take full advantage of the power of modern GPUs, this makes a lot of sense, and may mean that the game sees a gradual uptick in players as hardware continues to improve over the years. However, with
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  still going strong with new DLC dropping regularly, it remains to be seen if the king of life sims can truly be toppled.

  The Triumphant Light mini-set made significant changes to the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s metagame. The expansion’s impact has been so pronounced that it makes the previous mini-set, Mythical Island, almost insignificant. Now that the Triumphant Light has triggered major shifts in PvP, an important question arises: how can players counter the new meta?
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, the Triumphant Light mini-set has also led to the creation of some of the best anti-meta and counter decks in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  ’s history, with the finest examples listed below. (Some of these decks will probably endure the changes introduced by the Shining Revelry set.)

  Mew ex became the most popular tech card back in the Mythical Island era. However, Triumphant Light’s release has once again reintroduced it to the meta, this time as a counter to the Arceus ex dominance. What makes this counter setup unique is that it closely mirrors the Arceus ex &amp; Dialga ex lineup, with the key difference being the inclusion of Mew ex.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mew ex’s Genome Hack ability enables it to copy the opponent’s moves with three Colorless Energy. This means that the player may occasionally copy the enemy’s most devastating attack, such as Arceus ex’s Ultimate Force, before the opponent can use it.

 <p>
  It is worth noting that the Mew ex &amp; Dialga ex decks have generally been favored against the popular decks from the previous expansion. Consequently, they have achieved the highest success rates against decks like Charizard ex and Moltres ex, Exeggutor ex and Celebi ex, as well as Darkrai ex and Magnezone.

 <p>
  A surprising counter deck that emerged with the release of Triumphant Light was the combination of Palkia ex and its Origin Forme. The logic behind this lineup is straightforward: the player aims to ramp up either Palkia ex or Origin Forme Palkia using Manaphy while leveraging the Zone Energy to power up the other. However, what makes the deck an effective counter to the meta is the inclusion of a new Supporter: Irida.
 </p>
 <p>
  Irida’s role in the Palkia ex &amp; Origin Forme Palkia deck is crucial. She can provide the board with up to 160 HP, extending the damage dealer’s active time for at least another round. This is especially important for Palkia ex because it has an Energy-discarding effect, which makes it likely to get knocked out if its first strike fails to defeat the opponent. However, with Irida's help, Palkia ex can endure one more hit and, hopefully, resume dealing damage after a round or two.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of matchups, Palkia ex &amp; Origin Forme Palkia has been one of the best options against Arceus ex &amp; Dialga ex decks. Recent PvP data confirms that the Water-type duo has won 54% of the matches against this meta-dominating duo. But it’s also been a strong response to Leafeon ex &amp; Celebi ex (61.5% win rate) and Articuno ex’s 18-Trainer decks (55.5% win rate).

  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_25">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     One advantage of running a Palkia ex &amp; Origin Forme Palkia decks in the current meta is that their weakness to Lightning-type Pokemon won’t cause a significant threat, as Lightning decks have lost their popularity after the A2a mini-set release.

  The Water archetype in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is on the rise thanks to the addition of Irida. One of the decks that has leveraged this new Supporter to its fullest is the 18-Trainer Palkia ex lineup. It utilizes Irida to buy time for the Active Palkia ex while using Misty to ramp it.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, Palkia ex’s 18-Trainer deck has dominated all meta Grass-type decks, including the new Leafeon ex and Celebi ex alliance, achieving a +60% win rate. However, it has encountered difficulties against the mini-set’s top deck, Arceus ex &amp; Dialga ex. Additionally, it has not been the best choice against Magnezone lineups due to its weakness to Lightning-type Pokemon.

  If it weren’t for Arceus ex’s weakness to Fighting-type Pokemon, Gallade ex might have struggled to climb the meta. However, many players are pairing this card with the previous expansion’s top-performing sniper, Hitmonlee, to counter all Arceus ex setups. And the strategy seems to have paid off, as the Gallade ex &amp; Hitmonlee decks have a 55% win rate against Arceus ex &amp; Dialga ex. Additionally, they’ve also proven effective against three other popular decks: Charizard ex &amp; Moltres ex, Leafeon ex &amp; Celebi ex, and Darkrai ex &amp; Magnezone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being the second-best counter deck in Triumphant Light meta, the Gallade ex &amp; Hitmonlee lineup has proven to be incredibly vulnerable to two 18-Trainer decks: Articuno ex and Palkia ex. This vulnerability arises from Gallade ex being a Stage Two Pokemon, which is typically challenging to evolve on the Bench. In other words, fast-paced decks like the 18-Trainer Articuno ex and Palkia ex can effectively destroy the pre-evolution forms before they can evolve into Gallade ex and deal damage.

  The best counter or anti-meta deck in Triumphant Light is the refined Rampardos and Lucario deck. This duo holds the second-largest share of the meta, closely following the Arceus ex &amp; Dialga ex decks. Interestingly, this is the first time a counter deck designed in response to another meta deck has become so popular that it is practically the second-most-picked deck in PvP.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes the new Rampardos and Lucario decks so powerful against the meta is the addition of Sudowoodo. With this Fighting-type Pokemon, players can deal 70 damage to Arceus ex with just one Energy. This damage can be amplified to a remarkable 110 if the player has two Lucario cards on the board or 120 if they also play Giovanni.

  Once upon a time, tech-savvy kids could code their own games, sell them to publishers, and enter the computer world that way. These 'bedroom coders’ became a fad, especially in places where microcomputers like the Commodore 64 were big. Nowadays, they tend to get into software development in more typical, boring ways. But they haven’t gone away. If they’re not making indie games, they’re experimenting with ROM hacks and
  <strong>
  </strong>
  fan games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not every company is happy to see their IPs fiddled with like this, yet some tacitly tolerate it. For example, there have been a range of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic the Hedgehog
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan games and ROM hack competitions that have run for years, even decades, without Sega calling foul on them thus far. In some cases, they may have helped their collaborators get work at the Blue Blur’s company. Here are some of the best
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  fan games that can be found on the net.
 </p>

   <strong>
    Updated on March 27, 2025 by David Heath:
   </strong>
   The Sonic the Hedgehog games have caused a buzz to one degree or another, with opinions often shifting over time. Back in 2010, Sonic Colors was considered an improvement over Sonic Unleashed for ditching the werehog and focusing on the boost gameplay. 15 years and a dodgy remaster later, it's considered the lesser game for its reliance on 2D stages and autorunning sections.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  By contrast, Sonic Unleashed has been reappraised thanks to its more complex level design, and modern hardware being able to run its Jungle Joyride stage without turning it into a slideshow. Like them or loathe them, both games have been back in the news lately thanks to some fanmade remasters that give them a whole new dimension. So, it seemed fitting to include these works along some new entries, and give the list some spring-cleaning by reorganizing it a little. That way, readers can keep track of what type of fan game goes where, etc.

  took five years to fully complete. It's been worth it, as its development won its members multiple awards at the Sonic Hacking Contest over the years, coming 2nd in the 2019 and 2021 contests, before getting the top prize at the 2023 contest. That's not to mention its multiple community prizes and honorable mentions.

  Inspired primarily by

  , Sonic sees himself trapped in the underworld, where he must contend with its demonic denizens to find a way out. Given its inspirations, it's not the easiest hack out there, as it offers some particularly challenging boss fights. Luckily, it does come with difficulty settings, from Assist (for players who want mercy) to Maniac (for masochists). It's pretty much the perfect
  <em>
   Sonic

  fan game for players who want to get into the Halloween spirit.

  is an interesting one, as work began on it way back in 2004. According to BlueFrenzy, they planned a big 2D adventure involving Sonic and his friends stopping a possessed Egg Robo from creating their own mechanical empire. But the project's scope proved to be beyond their reach, and they had to focus on making a living instead. Its remaining data was thought lost when the hard drive containing it went kaput. However, it was about fifteen years later that BlueFrenzy found a pen drive containing a backup.
 </p>
 <p>
  With more time on their hands thanks to the pandemic, they streamlined what they had leftover to produce a fun combo of classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  action with additions from
  <em>
  </em>
  the
  <em>
   Advance
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Adventure
  </em>
  games. It has five characters, each with their own abilities, alongside six shields and plenty of hidden collectibles, including Chao Eggs for players to raise their own Chao. While not as sophisticated as later
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  fan games, it's an impressive display of skill with a lot to offer players.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Vs Darkness: True Nightmare Revived
   </em>
  </strong>
  is also a revival of an old project. Except this time, it was a game-ification of Nefault1st's own YouTube animated series. Here, Sonic and Shadow must collect the Chaos Emeralds before Dr. Eggman can use them for "Project Erubis," which plans to coat the world in eternal darkness (without being
  <em>
   Eternal Darkness
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  The game uses
  <em>
   Sonic Advance
  </em>
  sprites, but goes for
  <em>
   Sonic Rush
  </em>
  -style gameplay, complete with a
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  -style boost meter where the hedgehogs have to keep up their rings, or chain tricks together, to keep the meter topped up. The more meter energy they have, the more they can boost through its levels. The game even comes with customizable skills, an online multiplayer mode, and an original soundtrack. Sadly, the current build is more of a demo, with just a few levels and acts, but what's there is a highly polished
  <em>
   Sonic Rush
  </em>
  experience that's worth playing.

  The biggest additions to
  <em>
   Sonic Origins Plus
  </em>
  were the 12 Game Gear titles, many of which had previously appeared in older collections. As neat as they are, they don't look great when blown up onto a bigger screen. Savvy players can at least find the Master System releases of 8-bit
  <em>
   Sonic 1
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Chaos
  </em>
  to avoid the screen crunch. But the best of the bunch,
  <em>
   Sonic Triple Trouble
  </em>
  , was a Game Gear exclusive and doesn't have an alternative port.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Noah N. Copeland made his own with 16-bit graphics and new controls. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Triple Trouble 16-Bit
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Sonic can now do
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  's Drop Dash alongside
  <em>
   Triple Trouble
  </em>
  's Strike Dash. He can use the Elemental Shields from
  <em>
   Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles
  </em>
  , and he can tag out to Tails (who can swim and fly). Knuckles, Fang the Sniper, Amy Rose, and Metal Sonic can also be unlocked as playable characters too, so there's plenty for players to sink their teeth into.

  Players have to beat
  <em>
   Sonic Triple Trouble 16-bit
  </em>
  once as Sonic and Tails to unlock Knuckles, then beat it as Knuckles to play as the Blue Blur's metallic menace. But if they want him in his own game, Lone Devil reworked the original Genesis
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 2
  </em>
  into
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Sonic Rebooted
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In it, Metal Sonic has to prove he's not obsolete to Dr. Eggman by destroying his new badniks and collecting the Chaos Emeralds before them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metal Sonic comes with some special abilities. For five rings, he can blast ahead with the Overdrive Attack, or shoot diagonally in midair with the Diagonal Aerial Dash. The vertical equivalent, which can be used to find new shortcuts or level areas, requires 10 rings. He can also go into Overclocked Mode with 200 Rings, where he's faster and invincible, but it drains his rings faster than Super mode and doesn't work underwater. As a plus, he can't drown, so that's one advantage over the walking pincushion.

    Sonic Time Twisted

  began development in 2005, tweaked by multiple hands, each overseen by Overbound Game Studio until it was officially released in 2017. The game combines elements from
  <em>
   Sonic CD
  </em>
  and the Genesis games, as Sonic and friends have to collect the Chaos Emeralds and the Time Stones to stop Metal Sonic. Players can pick Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles to explore the Past and Future versions of eight zones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can use
  <em>
   Sonic 3
  </em>
  's Elemental Shields, alongside three new ones that let Sonic fly (Wind), resist spikes (Rock), and freeze badniks (Ice). They might need them, as they have to time travel via posts a la
  <em>
   Sonic CD
  </em>
  and find the Special Stage rings in both the Past and Future to get the Emeralds and Stones. They both involve beating Metal Sonic in a race, with the Past ones resembling his boss fight in
  <em>
   Sonic CD
  </em>
  , and the Future ones being like
  <em>
   Sonic 2
  </em>
  's special stages. They all have to be beaten to access the true final zone. So, no pressure.

  This list previously featured
  <em>

  , an inventive open-world take on classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games that, with work, could've become the definitive fan game equivalent to
  <em>
   Sonic Frontiers
  </em>
  . But its creator came under scrutiny for racism and abuse of other fan game developers. The worst of it was when he took over the
  <em>
   Sonic: From the Beginning
  </em>
  project and made it into
  <em>
   Sonic Overture
  </em>
  , where his behavior gradually led to its cancelation.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it's since come back with a fresh set of developers, levels, and assets as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Overture '95
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It's a prequel to
  <em>
   Sonic 1
  </em>
  based on its pre-release demo, as Sonic takes on the old prototype enemies in new zones on Christmas Island. The game uses some of its pre-planned mechanics, like walking on giant balls to get past obstacles while using some new features to produce 3D-style bosses. It currently only has 2 playable zones, but it's nice to see a project that deserves better treatment get a revival.

  Making fan games isn’t a surefire way to get hired by one big company or another. However, it’s one way to make an interesting resumé. Before Simon ‘Stealth’ Thomley put together Headcannon Studios and co-created
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Origins
  </em>
  , he worked with other notable coders on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It was an ambitious fangame that redrew and tweaked the original
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  levels and threw in new sound effects, music, moves, and characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sonic, Tails, Shadow, and Mighty all turned up, each with their own moves from the Lightspeed Dash to the time-stopping Chaos Control. The project stalled when it moved to a 4.0 beta build for Sega CD hardware and emulators. But the 3.0 build is stable and works with Genesis emulators and machines. The particularly sneaky can even find cartridge versions on the black market, but it’s safer (and cheaper) to search for the game online.

  Despite being a relatively short game (3 acts and a boss),
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic 1: The Next Level
   </em>
  </strong>
  swept the 2015 Sonic Hacking Contest, winning the most trophies out of any entry in the contest’s history up to that point. It only has 3 Acts and a Boss round, but it has new level assets, new music, new badniks, and smoother animation than the original game. That’s not to mention some new gameplay mechanics like antigravity and hoverbikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game also caught on beyond the Sonic Hacking community, appearing in
  <em>
   Retro Gamer
  </em>
  magazine's features among others. Footage of it was even used for Netflix’s
  <em>
   High Score
  </em>
  series in its episode on the Console War between the Genesis and SNES. The episode clearly displayed its title, gimmicks, and references (‘Jester Stream Technology’), but someone at Netflix somehow mistook it for a legit Sonic game. If only.

  Ever thought it was weird when a series makes a sequel or prequel to just one specific game? Like how the
  <em>
   Street Fighter Alpha
  </em>
  series (
  <em>
   Zero
  </em>
  in Japan) takes place before
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2
  </em>
  but after
  <em>
   Street Fighter 1
  </em>
  ? That’s what
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic: Before the Sequel
   </em>
  </strong>
  does for Sonic. Made by LakeFeperd, who went on to make the
  <em>
   Spark the Electric Jester
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   S:BtS
  </em>
  gives the hedgehog a new adventure where he meets Tails for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a very beefy game, with twelve zones to go through, with all but the final one having 3 acts per zone: two gameplay acts, and a boss one. If players want the good ending, they have to beat the game in under 2 hours to get it. Any longer and they’ll get the bad ending. Sonic isn’t as loaded with moves as in
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix
  </em>
  , but he has his spindash and
  <em>
   Sonic CD
  </em>
  ’s Super Peel-Out. Tails can fly as well, unlike in the original Genesis sequel.

  If LakeFeperd could make a ‘Sonic 1.5’, why not a ‘Sonic 2.5’? Thus,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic: After the Sequel
   </em>
  </strong>
  was made, with 10 new zones following the same structure as in the previous game; with the first nine having 2 levels, and 1 boss act each. Only now, players must find a hidden ring in each zone to jump into and play a secret version of that level with different weather effects. This game also gets rid of
  <em>
   S: BtS
  </em>
  's time-limit system for the good ending, which might be a relief for some.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, players can pick a Story Mode to automatically see it in action, or a Classic Mode to do the usual Sonic thing and grab the Chaos Emeralds via special stages to access it. Sonic now has access to elemental shields like the Fire and Water ones from
  <em>
   Sonic 3
  </em>
  , and a new Spike one. If eager Sonic fans do seek this one out, it’s best to track down the ‘DX’ version from 2017, which adjusts the physics and gives Sonic the Drop Dash from
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  .

 </p>
 <p>
  By acquiring EGGATS' feathers, Sonic can use portals to time travel between the past and present to save both versions of South Lakes from the evil doctors. It's a more story-driven Sonic game, but it's told sparingly with a few scenes to avoid bogging down the pace. It's got the same speed-based fun as LakeFeperd's prior games, only with new powerups that take inspiration from other games. The Boost shoes let Sonic boost a la

  LakeFeperd's fangames are a great place for
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  fans to start if they want to see what the community can come up with. But they do have a rival in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic and the Fallen Star
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It's a straightforward game, as it's a 2D platformer where players pick Sonic or Tails in a bid to stop Dr. Eggman's plans and piece the Mystic Star back together. But it comes with its own graphical style, resembling
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  's old-school charm but with its own flourishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game offers nine levels for players to race through, figuratively in the main campaign or literally via the Time Attack mode. Each has its gimmicks the player can use to their advantage, whether they're flying with Tails, or racing with Sonic's Drop Dash and Super Peel-Out. There are even Chaos Emeralds to collect, which offer an extra surprise if they're all gathered together. Then, just as a neat little extra, the game offers two toggleable original soundtracks, where players can switch between one or the other for its different modes and menus.

  Be it in its original form or the

  re-release,
  <em>
   Sonic Origins
  </em>
  is a fine collection, especially as it offers the first re-release of
  <em>

  </em>
  in ages. Still, it has a few issues, like the remixed music not being as good as the ‘Michael Jackson music’, and generally not being as polished as Headcannon Studios would’ve liked. However, the modding community has provided an alternative. With just a legal ROM of
  <em>
   Sonic 3&amp;K
  </em>
  , players can stick the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic 3: Angel Island Revisited
   </em>
  </strong>
  mod onto it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It gives players a ton of options to play with. They can switch the soundtrack around to regain those classic tunes, play the prototype music, or use DJ Spindash's new tracks. Players can also choose between the
  <em>

  </em>
  level layout or use the harder
  <em>
   Sonic 3
  </em>
  layout. Solo players can make Tails lift Sonic (or Knuckles) to higher ledges, a la
  <em>
   Sonic 4: Episode 2
  </em>
  . It can even support other mods! Its widescreen features and 60FPS gameplay are just the cherry on the cake
  <em>
   . Sonic 3
  </em>
  fans won’t need any other version of the game after this one.

  When
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  came out, people often said it felt like the Saturn-exclusive
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game fans never got, as it really felt like a step back into the classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  formula. Though the game was never meant to be a literal portrayal of what Sonic Team and/or Sega would've done if they could've gotten away with putting a 2D game on their console in a time when games had to be 3D or bust. Starteam didn't want to get that literal either, but they did want to get closer to the mark with a
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game that felt more 90s, more 32-bit, and more Saturn-esque.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Galactic
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles join forces to stop Dr Robotnik from using the mysterious Illusion Island for another nefarious scheme. It offers the same lush pastel palette
  <em>
   Mania
  </em>
  offered, but with all new stages, sprites and features designed by the team. For example, the trio gain new allies in the pistol-popping Fang the Sniper, and Tunnel the Mole with their digging skills. While it's currently only available as a demo, it's already gaining acclaim. If all goes well, it could end up being the
  <em>
   Mania
  </em>
  sequel fans didn't get.

  There aren't many 3D fan games out there, since they require beefier hardware and programming skills. After all, it's taken a total of 14 people a whole decade to whip
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic World DX
   </em>
  </strong>
  into shape across its multiple revisions. This fan game has 40+ playable characters and 50+ stages featuring a variety of missions, from the standard race to the goal to time attack races and treasure hunting. There's even a Chao Garden for fans who miss the virtual pet simulator mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's essentially the ultimate edition of
  <em>

  , with everyone from the first two
  <em>

  games
  <em>
   , Sonic
  </em>
  <em>
   Heroes,
  </em>
  <em>
   Sonic '06,

  and
  <em>

  </em>
  as playable characters. It even has a few deep dives, like
  <em>
   Sonic the Fighters
  </em>
  ' Bark the Polar Bear, Shade the Echidna from
  <em>
   Sonic Chronicles
  </em>
  , and Tiara from the canceled
  <em>
   Sonic Xtreme
  </em>
  game. All ten releases can be found on the Sonic World DX website. They're now on Release 9, and working on Release 10, but they still recommend using Release 8 for stability.

  People who'd prefer another 3D open-world Sonic game will find a good alternative in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Project Hero
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The game popped up in 2019, and received plenty of updates, but has since been on indefinite hiatus since 2023. It uses enemies, power-ups, music, and more from its official counterparts. However, it also has a few unique features of its own, like more playable characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sonic is there as usual with his running, jumping, and Elemental Shields. Then Tails returns, with
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  -style flight and
  <em>
   Sonic 06
  </em>
  -style bomb attacks (sans pointless dummy rings). Finally, there's Knuckles, who can glide and beat up enemies directly with his fists. By default, it has just one, Green Hill-style test level to test the silky-smooth physics with, but it is possible to mod in levels from other games like
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  to really test its mettle.

  The 2006
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  game on the PS3 and Xbox 360, or
  <em>
   Sonic '06
  </em>
  for short, is notoriously bad. The wonky physics, glitches, glacial load times, and woeful storytelling all came together to produce Sonic's nadir as a mascot. Many of its problems were due to its chaotic development, where its staff were either gradually divided off into other projects like
  <em>
   Sonic and the Secret Rings
  </em>
  , or left the company altogether, like the now-infamous Yuji Naka.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, there was a chance it could've been good, judging by
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic the Hedgehog: Project 2006
   </strong>
  </em>
  , or
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic P-06
   </em>
  </strong>
  for short. Since 2019, ChaosX has been rebuilding the game level by level within the Unity Engine, and it plays like a dream. All the characters are faster and more responsive, with more detailed graphics, heavily reduced load times, and new gameplay features like Super Sonic. The game now has all the main campaign levels, complete with bug fixes and other tweaks, as of its most recent update in November 2023.

For a free fangame, it stands way above Sonic's official fighters.

  There’s a host of different multiplayer modes, either locally or online. Players can help each other out in co-op or beat each other up in Match or Team Match. There’s even a Capture the Flag mode! Like

 <p>
  A recent leak from the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  community has revealed that Dahlia, the upcoming male character from Mondstadt, will wield a Sword. While
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  hasn't shied away from making dramatic changes to its gameplay in Natlan, it has mostly used new characters to accomplish it. Citlali elevated Melt to a new level, Varesa introduced a new take on Plunge, and now Escoffier is set to revitalize Freeze as a meta reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another pattern to these upcoming
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  characters is the fact that many of them have Support ability kits. Ifa, Mizuki, Iansan, and Escoffier are all examples of Support characters. While it's too early to tell what role Dahlia will have when he makes his playable debut in Version 5.7, players can expect to see the Deacon of the Church of Favonius in the upcoming Archon Quest in Mondstadt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to this appearance in the story, dataminers were able to correctly ascertain Dahlia's weapon type. While his element remains unknown, according to Mero, Dahlia is a Sword user from Mondstadt, and will be released alongside Skirk in Version 5.7. Taking earlier leaks into account, Dahlia will almost certainly be a 4-Star character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , as Kinich is expected to be the sole male 5-Star in the Natlan era. While this could undoubtedly disappoint many
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players, recent 4-Star characters have been quite formidable. Between Ororon, Lan Yan, Iansan, and Ifa, Natlan seems to value its 4-Stars.

 <p>
  A 4-Star Sword user of an unknown element, Dahlia has plenty of options on how to contribute to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact'
  </em>
  s ever-evolving meta. If he turns out to be Hydro, he could become the element's first Shield Support and a much-needed 4-Star. However, most players are hoping that he becomes Mondstadt's first Dendro character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , which could potentially open the door to legitimizing the new Elemental Reaction added to the Imaginarium Theater in Version 5.6.
 </p>
 <p>
  Curiously, Dahlia's concept art leaked two years ago. The
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  community was aware of the fact that Dahlia would join the playable cast at some point, and it seems that Version 5.7 will finally give the Deacon of the Church of Favonius his time to shine. While it remains to be seen if he will have any synergy with Skirk in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , players won't have to wait long to see Dahlia in the game. Version 5.6 launches on May 7, 2025, while Version 5.7 is set to be released on June 18, 2025.

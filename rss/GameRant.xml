  The Everlasting Gaze Azure Amulet is one of the more underrated unique amulets in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  , especially for classes that invest heavily into increasing their maximum mana. The more mana a player has, the better The Everlasting Gaze becomes.

  In
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  , there are three ways to get The Everlasting Gaze Azure Amulet. They are:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Random drop from regular monsters.
  </li>
  <li>
   By using an Orb of Chance on a white Azure Amulet.
  </li>
  <li>
   By trading with other players.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3 id="random-drop">
  Random Drop
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Everlasting Gaze Amulet has the possibility of dropping from level 39+ enemies
  </strong>
  , indicated by its base item level. This means it only enters the possible pool of drops starting from Act 3 in the campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only way players can influence the drop rate of The Everlasting Gaze (and other uniques) is by stacking 'Rarity of Items Found' on their gear and farming as many mobs as possible.
 </p>
 <h3 id="orb-of-chance">
  Orb of Chance
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Orb of Chance can be used on a Normal (white) Azure Amulet to gamble on the chance of obtaining The Everlasting Gaze Amulet.
  </strong>
  To do so, simply right-click on an Orb of Chance and left-click on the Azure Amulet. If it works, your item will be transformed into The Everlasting Gaze; if it fails, your item will either be destroyed or turned into something else. There are two possible uniques an Azure Amulet can turn into:

  The most reliable way to obtain The Everlasting Gaze Amulet in
  <em>
   PoE 2

  is through the official trade site. The going price for this item varies wildly depending on how good the rolls on two of its variable stats are, as well as how its corruption turns out.

 </div>
 <p>
  The reason The Everlasting Gaze Amulet is coveted is mainly because of one of its stats:
  <strong>
   Gain 20-30% of Maximum Mana as Extra Maximum Energy Shield
  </strong>
  . For mana-heavy builds, like Spark Sorceress or Infernalist Witch, this is a no-brainer because it directly converts 20-30% of their mana into Energy Shield, the best defensive stat in the entire game. The only things standing between incoming damage and a player's Life are Evasion, Armor, and Energy Shield. Among them, ES is the most reliable because it has none of the downsides of the other two.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Everlasting Gaze Azure Amulet's ability to increase this all-important stat by a huge amount is why it works so well in almost all builds, but especially ones that invest heavily into mana. Additionally, The Everlasting Gaze also gives a
  <strong>
   +70-100% Mana Regeneration Rate
  </strong>
  thanks to the combination of its implicit and suffix, making mana recovery vastly easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do keep in mind, however, that while this amulet is great for the campaign, early endgame, and even some pinnacle bosses, it is not BiS for most builds. This is because it is entirely defensive, with no utility other than mana regen and no offensive stats. Ideally, an amulet should also provide flat stats, rarity of items found, spirit, and resistance if you're not capped; Everlasting Gaze provides none of these. That said, if the rest of your gear covers these requirements for your endgame build, The Everlasting Gaze will be a nice cherry on top.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been dethroned as Steam's most-wishlisted game with Capcom's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  taking the top spot. After dropping
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  to the third spot,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  surpassed Valve's
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  in total wishlists on Steam as the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  community prepares for the game's launch next month.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  was announced in February 2019, roughly two years after the critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  game was released. At first glance, 2019 seemed like a year that would have been full of updates for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  , but this didn't turn out to be the case. Nearly six years have passed since the initial reveal with just a few updates from Team Cherry in recent years. On January 18, Team Cherry's head of marketing and publishing, Matthew Griffin, confirmed that
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  is still in development and "will release" at some point. Further details weren't given about the upcoming title, but Griffin's post gave fans hope of more updates and news from the developers in 2025, a year full of major game releases.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ahead of the game's February 28 launch,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  surpassed
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  on the Steam top wishlists page, as spotted by The Gamer. In addition,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has climbed into the top ten best-selling games on Steam's global list, which is a sign that many gamers around the world are preparing for the game's launch next month. A price and release date for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  have not been revealed yet, but its place as the third most-wishlisted game shows that there's still a lot of interest from Steam gamers in 2025. For example,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  fans recently came up with a theory while waiting for a news update from Team Cherry.

 <p>
  New details on
  <em>

  exact development progress may be scarce, but it's clear that Team Cherry's new title is still one of 2025's most anticipated games. Excitement for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  could be amplified if the game is confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2 at the upcoming April 2025 Nintendo Direct, as it's been a speculated title for many Nintendo Directs and Indie World showcases in the years following the game's 2019 reveal.

  Former Nintendo employees are talking about the difference between
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kirby
   </strong>
  </em>
  games' box art in Japan and the west. While it was previously noted during a developer interview in the 2010s that Kirby typically had a fiercer countenance in the west to appeal to American buyers, this new discussion goes into a bit more detail on the
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  game decision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kirby has been around for a long time, being one of the few remaining popular game characters still receiving new games that first appeared on a black and white console. It turns out that Kirby's origins in
  <em>
   Kirby's Dream Land
  </em>
  play a role in why his appearance looks different on some game covers.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent chat with Polygon, former Nintendo localization director Leslie Swan and former Nintendo Minute host Krysta Yang both talked about the iconic puffball and why some of the game covers in the
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  series have looked different in the west. According to Swan, the main change was to appeal to tween and teen buyers in the US. Swan points out that fewer girls were playing games at the time, so the company wanted to market the game to boys.
  <em>
   Kirby's Dream Land
  </em>
  didn't pose much of an issue, because classic Game Boy games were in black and white, but once Kirby moved to full-color systems, Nintendo of America became concerned about how to market a pink fluffy ball to boys in the west. Instead of recoloring Kirby or something similar, they instead added the furrowed eyes to the character on the box art, which Swan said was intended to make Kirby look fierce and tenacious, not angry.

  Krysta Yang also commented, explaining that Nintendo wanted child-friendly games, but didn't want to be labeled as producing "kiddie" games. As a result, the marketing team made an effort to make Kirby appear tougher, calling him the "Super Tough Pink Puff" so that older children and boys would still find him appealing. Yang notes that it wasn't that outlandish to do such a thing, as
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  games do contain a lot of action.
 </p>
 <p>
  These days, many players know Kirby better from the
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  series than the original
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  titles. Kirby does snap to his fiercer expression from time to time through combat and the games' stories, but it also seems that players are much more comfortable with the idea of the tough-but-pink puff these days. In fact, Kirby may have even helped to boost the popularity of a similarly cute-but-tough pink puff, as Jigglypuff was added to the original
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  because it had a similar shape to Kirby, allowing for the two to have similar movesets and some shared animations.

 <p>
  Eagle’s Tower is widely considered the most iconic dungeon in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  due to its innovative and challenging mechanics. The main objective is to topple four pillars with a demolition ball, drastically altering the tower's structure to open new paths. This unique design approach requires strategy and offers an experience that remains memorable for players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Eagle’s Tower is a brilliant example of the integration between theme and mechanics, with puzzles that challenge logic and navigation. Although some players may find the process tedious at certain moments, the sense of accomplishment upon overcoming its challenges is unparalleled. This combination of innovation, and complexity solidifies it as one of the best dungeons in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  offers the mechanic of Link shrinking in size at certain moments of the adventure and, although it is well utilized throughout the game, it is precisely Deepwood Shrine, the game’s first dungeon, that best takes advantage of these elements. Its design is simple and does not demand much from players, but it is extremely fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, this dungeon in
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  also does a good job of showing how the game’s scale feeling works, since its final boss is a ChuChu, an enemy that is easy to handle on other occasions but becomes a challenging fight given Link’s reduced size. Thus, Deepwood Shrine serves very well to situate players in this new setting and set the tone for the entire adventure.

  Tower of the Gods is one of the most emblematic dungeons in
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  , serving as a divine test to determine if Link is worthy of wielding the Master Sword. Located in the middle of the Great Sea, the tower combines aquatic puzzles and creative challenges that utilize the navigation mechanics with the King of Red Lions, creating a dynamic experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the challenges, the dungeon features a design that blends divine and mysterious elements, reinforcing its importance in the narrative. The puzzles involving the use of items like bow and arrow, coupled with changes in water levels, keep exploration always interesting, making Tower of the Gods an epic journey full of symbolism for the game’s themes.

  The Sandship is one of the most remarkable dungeons in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
  </em>
  thanks to its unique setting - a stranded ship in the desert. It perfectly intertwines exploration and creativity, utilizing the Timeshift Stone to alternate between past and present, enabling players to solve complex puzzles while uncovering more of the location’s history.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to innovative mechanics, the Sandship stands out for an atmosphere that fuses mystery and discovery, forging an unforgettable experience. The battle against Tentalus is a good finale for this dungeon, but the true highlight lies in its fantastic puzzles and some of the best narrative elements in the series, leaving a lasting impression on players.

  As the final dungeon Link must overcome before heading to the Moon to face Majora’s Mask, the Stone Tower Temple is also one of the most challenging in the franchise, requiring use of Link’s four forms to progress. Additionally, it compels players to flip the entire temple upside down to move forward
 </p>
 <p>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its demanding nature, this temple ranks among the best in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , pushing Link in various ways and making extensive use of items collected throughout the journey. It is therefore an ideal choice for those who enjoy a higher level of difficulty, featuring not only complex puzzles but also mini-boss encounters until its complete conclusion.

 <p>
  The approach this title in the franchise takes with more realistic graphics makes Arbiter’s Grounds not only one of the most iconic dungeons in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , but also one of the most terrifying. This is because the place is inhabited by Poes, which, thanks to the game’s artistic direction, have a terrifying appearance instead of their cartoony look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Arbiter’s Grounds is the first dungeon that Link visits after obtaining the Master Sword and the location has great importance for the game, advancing the narrative at certain points. The place also forces players to use both the protagonist’s human form and wolf form, making exploration even more interesting.

  Hyrule Castle is one of the most iconic places in the entire
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  franchise, and in
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , the place is also one of the most important dungeons in the game. At the very beginning of the journey, the protagonist needs to infiltrate the place to save Princess Zelda using a more stealth-focused approach to avoid being caught by enemy guards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later, players return to Hyrule Castle, after gaining access to the Master Sword, to rescue the princess again and also face Agahnim. Thus, in
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , the dungeon has enormous importance for the game’s story, present in various moments of the character’s journey, making it an iconic place for many players.

  Although not a location that stands out for its design or difficulty, The Eagle, or Level-1, is among the most iconic dungeons in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  for being the franchise’s first. It was from it that the dungeon became a common element in the subsequent games, becoming a hallmark of the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the design of The Eagle is quite simple, but it provides access to some items that will be very useful throughout the rest of the journey, such as the Boomerang, which helps to face various enemies during the game. Additionally, the confrontation against Aquamentus, a green dragon, is an excellent way to showcase the epic tone that the franchise would have in future titles.

 <p>
  Even though the dungeons in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild
  </em>
  are not among the best in the series, Hyrule Castle is an exception, offering one of the best experiences in the franchise. What makes this place so good is the great freedom players have when exploring it, with various ways to reach the final part.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, players can skip some parts of Hyrule Castle using abilities like Revali’s Gale or even the Zora Set. However, the exploration and challenges the place offers are also worthwhile, as it is possible to find the Hylian Shield in this dungeon, one of the best equipment in the game to be used by Link during battles.

  Although not one of the best dungeons created for Link’s adventure in
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , the Water Temple in this game is one of the most iconic ever made for the franchise. The place can only be explored when the protagonist is in his adult form and contains some mechanics that stayed in players' minds, especially the need to constantly switch boots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, besides being one of the most iconic dungeons in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , the Water Temple is also a very divisive place, as its unique design may please some players but also be frustrating at times. However, that is what makes it one of the most remembered places by fans, making the experience of exploring it something unique in the series to date.

      <title>Diablo 4's Lead Class Designer is Leaving Blizzard</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-lead-class-designer-leaving-blizzard/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The Lead Class Designer of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Adam Jackson, has decided to leave Blizzard after 15 years at the studio. Jackson has become a pretty well-known figure among
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  fans and will likely be missed.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->

 <p>
  Released in 2023,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  started Season 7 on January 21, 2025. The new chapter is known as Season of the Witchcraft, and it brings a new questline focused on the Witches of Hawezar, where the player will fight to help them track down the missing Heads of the Tree of Whispers. The season comes with new witchcraft-based powers, bosses, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Soon after the beginning of Season 7, Adam Jackson revealed on social media that he will no longer work at Blizzard. The developer called the 15 years he worked at Blizzard a “long, strange trip” with a “bittersweet” ending, but also seemed excited to start another project. Jackson became a regular face with the community by participating in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ’s Campfire Chats, livestreams which generally talked about mechanical and balancing changes made between different seasons. Unfortunately, Jackson did not reveal where he would work next, but his statement suggests that he’s about to be involved in a new project soon.

 </h2>
 <p>
  It’s uncertain whether the balancing of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ’s classes will be affected in any way by Jackson’s departure. It’s still unknown who will get Jackson’s position as the new Lead Class Designer, but it’s possible that this new designer will have a big input into the next class coming to
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , so some design choices may reflect that. While no class has been officially announced yet, it’s very likely that Blizzard could release yet another class when the next expansion comes out, as it did with Spiritborn in
  <em>
   Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  .

  While the new season is an exciting time for the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  fanbase, this new chapter in the game’s history is not without issues. According to multiple gamers,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  currently has severe crashing issues, which started soon after the season’s update. On social media, it’s possible to find multiple gamers who had difficulties logging in or faced crashes every hour or so while playing due to memory leaks. However, these problems do not seem to affect all players equally. Hopefully, these problems will be fixed soon, and gamers will be able to enjoy the new Season of Witchcraft without constant crashes.

      Mewtwo's supposed evolution, Mewthree, was a popular rumor among fans of the original
      <em>
       Pokemon
      </em>
      games, fueled by the mystery surrounding Mew and Mewtwo.
     </li>
     <li>
      Fans speculated that holding down the B button after throwing a Pokeball would increase the chances of catching a Pokemon, but this method did not actually work.
     </li>
     <li>
      The rumor of an evolved form of Raichu, known as Gorochu, spread among fans due to an NPC in the original games and beta designs that hinted at the possibility.

  The first
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  games to be released in the West were
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  in 1997. These games were a smash hit and quickly gathered a large and passionate fanbase. People wanted to know more about the franchise, but there was little else the series could provide until the sequels were released.

 <p>
  Because the internet wasn't as prevalent at the time, most people heard about the games through word of mouth on the school playground. As such, not all the information fans learned about the games was true. It seems that almost everyone heard the same
  <strong>
   rumors about Gen 1
  </strong>
  ; some were quite funny, while others had an element of truth to them.

   The Pokemon series has come a long way since the release of Pokemon Red and Blue back in 1996. Today, the franchise is nearing its 30-year anniversary, which means that many fans will soon be feeling quite nostalgic about the series' early days, a time before the internet allowed for immediate access to all manner of information. Back then, playground rumors and online hoaxes were rampant, and this resulted in many walking away with misinformed knowledge of the original Pokemon generation. With so many rumors having existed, this article has been updated to feature even more. These additional rumors for the Gen 1 era weren't just widely believed at the time, but some are still even up for debate depending on who fans ask.

  Even casual
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans know about Missingno, the glitch Pokemon that can be encountered in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red &amp; Blue
  </em>
  under certain conditions. The encounter certainly seemed legit, which prompted a statement from Game Freak to assert that the Pokemon is simply a programming quirk and may have adverse effects on a player's game.

 <p>
  However, one of the consequences widely reported about Missingno was that it was able to delete save files, which isn't true. What Missingno
  <em>
   can
  </em>
  do, however, is create more graphical glitches, duplicate certain items, and corrupt the Hall of Fame data in a player's save.

  This
  <em>
   Pokemon Red &amp; Blue
  </em>
  rumor can be attributed to an April Fool's issue of
  <em>
   Expert Gamer
  </em>
  magazine, which alleged that Dragonite could evolve into the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  character Yoshi. Fans likely wouldn't have believed this prank if there wasn't a photo in the magazine showcasing how said evolution could be achieved, which fooled a lot of young gamers at the time.

 <p>
  According to the hoax, two players, each with
  <em>
   Pokemon Red
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Blue
  </em>
  , would have to complete both versions and collect all 150 Pokemon. Then, one player would trade the other a Dratini. That player would then evolve the Pokemon into a Dragonite and trade it back. Then, the Dragonite could be evolved with a Fire Stone in Mewtwo's cave, which would allow players to get Yoshi.

  Lavender Town is already a creepy location in the Kanto region, mostly thanks to its eerie theme music. This music actually resulted in an urban legend that many believed, where it was alleged that the music drove hundreds of Japanese children to suicide in the '90s. The story grew in popularity as a creepypasta that was believed by many on the Internet.

 <p>
  While the music didn't actually have any horrifying effects on children who played the Gen 1 games, it was changed in later games to be happier and less eerie. The Pokemon Tower was also replaced in future generations with the Kanto Radio Tower, but even without the creepypasta lore, Lavender Town is still creepy just for implying that Pokemon can die.

  The Orange Islands were a location that Ash, Misty, and new companion Tracey journey to in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  anime. Its origin came from the anime needing a filler arc while Game Freak developed the next generation of games, introducing alternate Pokemon designs well before
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon
  </em>
  would incorporate regional forms.

 <p>
  However, some fans were led to believe that the Orange Islands were actually present in the original games. The rumor was that, if the in-game clock was maxed out, players could ride the S.S. Anne to the Orange Islands and explore a whole new region. Other rumors indicated that the Orange Islands could be accessed by beating the Pokemon League 100 times.

  While many Gen 1 rumors didn't pan out to be true, this one eventually inspired the franchise's future. PokeGods were rumored to be invincible versions of existing Pokemon. Slowking, Marill, and Togepi were all assumed to be these PokeGods, though they ended up just being early Gen 2 designs that were leaked.

 <p>
  As for the evolutions of existing 'mons, many fully-evolved Gen 1 Pokemon had fake PokeGod designs, including the starter trio, Raichu, and Gengar. Some fans believed there was a secret item called the Mist Stone that could evolve any Pokemon. While it didn't turn out to be true, Mega Evolution explored the idea of final-stage Pokemon growing stronger.

  One of the most notable PokeGods was Mewthree, an upgraded version of Mewtwo. In fairness, there was a lot of mystery surrounding Mew and Mewtwo when the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games were released. Mewtwo was a strange legendary, and only one of them could be found after completing the game.

 <p>
  Some of the prevailing theories on how to get Mewthree involve beating the Elite Four a certain number of times or leveling up the legendary Pokemon to level 100. Of course, there was never another version of Mewtwo, but new rumors did return in the lead-up to
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  when Mega Mewtwo X &amp; Y were first teased.

 <p>
  The catch mechanics in the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game were fairly straightforward, and this method is still used in the series today. To catch a wild Pokemon, the player first has to lower its health bar and then throw a Pokeball. However, the different catch rates of various Pokemon made some players think there was a secret way to prevent them from escaping.

 <p>
  As a result, a rumor spread. It suggested that holding down the B button on the Game Boy after throwing a Pokeball would increase the odds of catching a Pokemon. Though this would have been an interesting feature, this particular method did not actually work.

  The

  developers only have themselves to blame for the rumor about an evolved form of Raichu making the rounds. For starters, there is a scientist on Cinnabar Island in the original games who wants to trade his Electrode for a Raichu, but when players talk to him after the trade, he will happily exclaim that his Raichu has just evolved.

  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  developers eventually released a series of beta designs for the original games, one of which was a Pokemon that looked like it could be Raichu's evolution. This beta Pokemon has been dubbed Gorochu and has appeared in some fan art and games. Raichu never ended up with an evo, but Alolan Raichu offers a new take on its design.

 <p>
  Professor Oak is one of the first people the player encounters in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise. As a famous professor who knows everything about Pokemon, many players expected him to be a pretty good trainer, too. This began the various rumors that the professor was going to be the final battle in the game and that he was a very powerful champion.

 <p>
  Although this is untrue, there is a specific glitch in the games that allows players to battle Oak by using some careful steps involving teleporting with an Abra and breaking through the game's barriers. His team consists of an Exeggutor, Gyarados, Tauros, Arcanine, and the fully evolved form of whichever starter was not picked by the player or the rival.

  There were plenty of rumors surrounding Mew at the time of Generation 1's release. The fact that one of the developers had slipped a secret Pokemon in the games was widespread knowledge, but no one knew how to get this strange Mew. However, one of the most popular theories involved the Pokemon hiding under a truck.

  To the side of the SS Anne, there is a small section of land with only a truck on it. Most players noticed this random truck but could not work out what it was for. The rumor stated that players would need to surf over to the island and use Strength on the truck to reveal Mew underneath. This wasn't true, but it didn't stop hundreds of fans from trying it.

  Gamer and artist MjyrnChoon has shared a 3D model of the
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  farmer's house and front yard. The model is shown from multiple angles, allowing viewers to see all the details that went into it. Just about everything a player would see early on in the game is present here. From the farmer's cabin to the small patches of crops to the well, despite the alternate art style, it's completely recognizable for fans of the series. However, the little details are perhaps where the model shines the brightest, with chubby little birds, mushrooms, and shimmering lights bringing the piece to life.

 <p>
  The

  </em>
  community has responded very positively to the model, praising the creator for their talent and attention to detail, and particularly for how cute it is. Fans have complimented the art not only for its execution, but for the thoughtfulness of the design, as the player had to reimagine pixel art from a fixed perspective as a 3D space. Fans wanted to know how the model was created, to which the artist responded that they used Blender, a 3D modeling and animation program.

  The farmer's home is a common subject for players to turn into art, especially when reimagining the world in a different artstyle. Fans of the game have made the
  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  farmer's home as a real-world 3D miniature model, with LEGO, and others have tried their hand at making it in a 3D modeling program, too. However, it's not the only subject matter, as players also seem to be fond of the

  While most would say that part of
  <em>

  's charm comes from its visuals, it's always neat to see the world as it might be depicted in a different medium. ConcernedApe has mentioned that he's open to the idea of a
  <em>

  movie, and allegedly even thinks
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  could collab, so there's a chance that players could see elements of the game in another format officially someday.

      <title>Elden Ring: 11 Lightest Armor Sets, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-best-light-armor-sets-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Armors play a crucial role when taking on enemies in The Land Between as they act as the last line of defense between the Tarnished and the brutal attacks dealt by different enemies. The pieces of armor are designed in a way to protect the warriors from the brutal attacks of the wicked and the might of the gods. As players equip different pieces of armor, the weight carried by the players hinders agility, making it important to keep a tab on the weight of the armor when equipping it. With the game giving a variety of armor pieces found across the Land Between, there are a number of options available for the players.

  While light armor does not absorb the damage like heavy ones. They are known for their agile movements as they reduce the burden on the equip load. These sets are useful as they open up the option of offensive gameplay. Along with opening an entirely different section of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  fashion, Light Armors, despite being frail, can be utilized in many ways, which brings this list as it presents the best Light Armor Pieces available in the game.

 <p>
  The Mushroom set focuses entirely on immunity, which makes it one of the highest immunity-providing sets in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . With mushrooms growing all over and on the head as well, this set makes up for an odd case of a walking fungus.

 <p>
  The set offers the bare minimum when it comes to protection from enemy attacks but boasts superior immunity, focus, and vitality. The set is extremely lightweight and, with its unique use case, it can be utilized in areas like the Aeonia Swamp or Lake of Rot to avoid the debuff status.

 <p>
  One of the lightest sets available on this list is the Raptor’s set. Taking the form that resembles a crow, this set is a smaller upgrade to the bandit set. The chest piece of this set enhances the jump attacks by increasing its power by 10%.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1018} -->

 <p>
  Overall, the set possesses lower levels of damage negation properties but has decent immunity which slows down the effects of various poisons and rot. Raptor’s set is also available as a part of the starting gear when choosing the Bandit set, making it good armor to start the game with when choosing the Bandit class.

  Land of Reeds Armor set is another set on this list that can be obtained as a part of the starting equipment when choosing a class. Initially obtained when choosing the samurai class, this set is built to reduce the damage taken by the warriors on the battlefield.

  While the damage negation of this set might seem subpar when checking against physical damage, it shines against magic and elemental attacks. The set also boasts strong resistance to various debuffs like poison, rot, frostbite, and death.

  Dressed in samurai fashion, reminiscent of a character from a Kurosawa movie, this armor set enhances agility while providing protective boons to help the samurai survive the harsh world of
  <em>
   Elden Ring

 <p>
  Lightweight armor sets are especially beneficial for magic-focused playstyles, as there are many options available with minimal weight. Among them, two such options are Lusat’s set and Azur’s set. The reason to cover them under a single entry is how similar they are in their nature.

 <p>
  Featuring similar stats when it comes to offering safety from attacks, the two sets are extremely useful if players are using certain spells.

 <p>
  Talking about Lusat’s armor set, it increases the damage of Stars of Ruin by 15% and damage of Star Shower and Glintstone Star by 10% but at the cost of increasing the FP cost of all sorceries by 15%.

 <p>
  On the other hand, the Azur’s Glintstone armor set increases the damage of Comet Azur by 15% and the damage of Glintstone Cometshard and Comet by 10% at the cost of an extra 15% FP cost for all sorceries.

 <p>
  The two sets can increase the output of some of the strongest spells in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring,
  </em>
  but at a price, and if players are using the mentioned spells, these two sets can be worth checking out despite their demerits.

  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree DLC
  </em>
  brings heaps of new content to the game, including the addition of new bosses, areas, and armor. Messmer’s set is one of those newly added armor sets that belong in the lightweight category.

 <p>
  The set mainly improves Fire Knight’s skills and incantations of Messmer’s fire and, with the entire set weighing thin, makes things easier for the player, as they can distribute their stats into categories other than endurance. Like Malenia's set, this armor can also be seen as a trophy, showcasing the player's victory over Messmer the Impaler.

  Some of the top-tier lightweight armor lists include the Malenia’s set in their list for two reasons. Its sturdy yet featherweight design and its stylish nature make it one of the most fashionable armor sets that allows players to cosplay as the Goddess of Rot, one of the most infamous boss fights known in the game.

 <p>
  The armor grants high immunity and robustness along with decent guarding against physical and magical attacks. Made with unalloyed gold, the armor also serves as a testament to the grueling battle against Malenia and the player's hard-fought victory against her.

 <p>
  Debuting in the new DLC, the Fire Knight set is a lightweight armor option for players seeking to manage their equipment load efficiently. The brand-new armor set is a solid choice to pick, especially because of its helm. The helm of this set offers a good buff to max health, stamina and equip load.

 <p>
  Increasing the mentioned stats and fire damage cut rate by 5%, the set is not only good at applying buffs but also has decent defensive abilities. Along with decent damage negation for its weight category, the Fire Knight set is an option that can be considered when deciding how to dress up Tarnished.

  When looking for robust armor with solid physical and magical protection without being overly heavy, the Drake Knight set becomes a great choice for players. Worn by the unmet Drake Knights, this set offers good resistance against slashing and piercing.

  The Drake Knight set is a late-game armor, so players might have to wait before getting their hands on it, but it is worth the wait as it can be useful, especially against enemies appearing in the late game. The armor has its unique look and while the helm might not be everyone’s cup of tea, the armor is a great choice when looking for something lightweight in either category – utility or fashion.

 <p>
  Death Knight set is a brand-new armor set introduced in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree DLC
  </em>
  . Composed of four pieces, this armor set is especially known for its ability to boost skills and incantations of the ancient dragon cult.

 <p>
  The armor goes beyond aesthetics as it boasts strong defense, resistance, and poise for its weight category. For each piece worn, the set gives players a 2% boost, resulting in an overall 8% boost when the entire set is worn. Given how some of the best skills and incantations in the DLC are from Ancient Dragon Cult, the Death Knight set is certainly a good option to try out.

  The chest piece of this set permanently muffles the wearer's footsteps, similar to Crepus's Vial talisman and the Assassin’s Approach incantation.

 <p>
  This ability makes this set special, as players can sneak behind enemies easily without requiring to use a spell or an incantation. The armor also has a solid ability to protect its wearer, making it worth obtaining it when looking for light armor.

  Ronin’s set is one of the best lightweight options players can choose in the game. Worn by Bloody Finger Hunter Yura, Ronin’s set is one of the most weight-efficient sets with the amount of protection it offers.

 <p>
  However, there is a catch in acquiring this armor, as players can miss it entirely if the steps are not followed in the proper order. Ronin’s set for its equip load provides solid damage negation across all categories making it well-versed in almost every respect.

 <p>
  The same can be applied to the resistance as well, and while it has a low poise stat, the same can be said about other lightweight armor sets on the list, making it one of the best picks in the lightweight segment.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak revealed the upcoming playable character Pulchra. Set in the dystopian city of New Eridu,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  is centered around the Proxy as they guide a roster of Agents venturing into the Hollows.

 <p>
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  has a diverse roster of Agents, ranging from humans that use advanced technology to their advantage to unique anthropomorphic beings called Thirens. The latter includes humans with animal features, like Ellen Joe, as well as Beast Thirens, who possess more prominent animal traits, like Von Lycaon and Ben Bigger. These beings are said to exhibit superhuman abilities, such as immense strength, rapid recovery, and better adaptability in Hollows.

 <p>
  Many
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero

  fans have requested more S-rank Thirens to be added to the game, and it seems like their wish may come true soon. A new leak from mero revealed an upcoming playable character named Pulchra, who has cat-like features and wields guns. It's still unknown what her rank, element, and fighting style will be, but she might likely be a long-range DPS unit like Zhu Yuan.

 <p>
  Not much is known about Pulchra for now, but many fans have theorized that
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  might introduce an all-Thiren faction in a future update. Pulchra was also previously leaked as an enemy NPC, so it's possible that players might battle her at some point. Likewise, the fans also expressed their excitement about playing Pulchra and other Thiren characters that might be associated with her. A number of them have also created dedicated Twitter and Reddit pages to provide updates on Pulchra.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, leaks haven't given an estimated release date for Pulchra yet, so fans will have to wait patiently for
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's official announcement. What fans can expect in upcoming updates is a Sons of Calydon-centered storyline featuring new S-rank Agents Caesar King and Burnice White. A recent leak has also teased the character model for Big Daddy, who is a boar Thiren that looks similar to the tusked boar on Sons of Calydon's crest.

 <p>
  As a relatively new game,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  still has a lot of potential to expand its universe and offer more riveting Hollow missions. Avid players are also curious to see how

  <em>
   Clash Royale has evolved significantly over the years, introducing new cards, levels, heroes, and game modes for players to enjoy. However, the first order of business is climbing up the Arena in the main game mode to unlock the ability to get new cards. There is very little point in trying to build an end-game deck before reaching Arena 15 or higher. To do so, players will first have to earn trophies in the lower Arenas to climb up. This article has been updated with an additional possible deck players can use to advance.

 <p>
  Hog Rider is a fast and easy win condition to build around and support. The main point of this deck is to get as many hits on the opposing towers with the Goblin Barrel while distracting the tower and opposing troops with the Hog Rider and giving them reliable support with Musketeer and the Fire Spirit for ground and air swarming troops. Fireball and Zap are some of the great spell combinations possible that can clean up after any failed pushes, with the Inferno Tower having great use for defense.

 <p>
  If the opponent has Zap, try to bait it out with the Skeleton Army, Goblin Barrel, or Inferno Tower, and then punish them when they do. Opposing tanks like Giant or Pekka can be countered by Inferno Tower, which should be held in reserve for those occasions. The only answer for Goblin Barrel in Arena 6 is either Fireball or Arrows, both of which are either equal exchanges or a loss of elixir to the other side.

 <p>
  This deck is a defensive powerhouse with cards that have the versatility to be played against many decks that can be thrown its way. The Giant can soak up plenty of damage and give troops behind it the leeway to rain down plenty of damage with the security of not being targeted by enemy troops and towers. Arrows and Fireball are great for supporting the Giant on offense, while Tombstone is key because, with proper placement, it can buy time for other troops to clean up on defense.

 <p>
  Pairing Giant's push with Baby Dragon is key in order to deal with an opposing Skeleton Army or Minions, which can easily chew down the Giant to zero if not answered. Putting the Mini Pekka behind Giant can help whittle down tank killers like Pekka but should mostly be held in reserve as a single target damage dealer on the defensive.

 <p>
  P.E.K.K.A unlocks in Arena 6 and serves as an excellent answer to almost anything the opponent can throw at the player, including Hog Rider, Giant, Valkyrie, and Knight. However, Pekka should almost always be used defensively as a response to what the opponent is doing. It is not a win condition on its own and can easily get countered by Skeleton Army or Inferno Tower. This deck is entirely reactive, and the play depends on what comes from the other side. Once Pekka is on the field, put the Battle Ram behind her just as she crosses the bridge, allowing her to tank the tower hits.

 <p>
  Witch is a defensive option for dealing with flying units that threaten Pekka. Bats and Knight are lower elixir cost answers to air and land units, but the main goal is to remain defensive. Only after double elixir kicks in should players push for tower damage on the opponent. Zap is an answer to both the Skeleton Army and Inferno Tower but can be used to deal with opposing Bats as well. Once one tower is whittled down to zero, maintain defensive positioning and let the timer run out for victory.

 <p>
  Battle Ram deals significant damage when connecting to any building or tower. Building around this with a good cycle of cheap defensive troops like Minions and Knight to soak up damage makes this deck able to play very fast and aggressively on offense and defense. Goblin Cage is a great counter to building targeting troops with other cheap troops that can come in and clean up on defense, clearing the way again for the Battle Ram.

 <p>
  The point of this deck is to cycle through units as fast as possible, which means using the two 1-Elixir cost units, Electro Spirit and Skeletons, on cooldown. If done correctly, this means that during double elixir, two knights and two sets of minions will be able to accompany a Battle Ram to the other side, an overwhelming force that can wreck basically anything at this stage of the game within seconds.

 <p>
  This great defensive deck can give the opponent a tough time dealing with the Goblin Barrel. The Skeleton Army and Fire Spirit are useful in baiting out spells that can counter the Goblin Barrel, while cards like the Valkyrie, Musketeer, and Inferno Tower can really shine on defense.

 <p>
  The Goblin Barrel is the win condition in this deck, which means it needs to find a way to deal chip damage to opponent towers. An easy way to do this is to use the Valkyrie to tank the tower hits and throw the Goblin Barrel at the very edge of the Arena. By not throwing the Barrel directly at the tower, any answer the other player has for this card, such as Arrows or Fireball, will turn into wasted elixir and allow the Goblins to hit the tower.

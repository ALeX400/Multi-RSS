  Upgrading your equipment with newer and better weapons and armor is a staple form of character progression in any MMORPG and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  is no exception to this. As players progress through the Main Scenario Quest, they'll have ample opportunities to find new gear from a variety of merchants, dungeons, and bosses, allowing them to customize not only their characters' stats, but their appearance as well.

  Artifact Armor are a recurring theme in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14

  </em>
  included, have given these item sets away for free, giving all players an equal footing as they enter the post-Main Scenario Quest content, such as expert dungeons, extreme trials, raids, and more. Read on to learn how to obtain complete sets of Artifact Armor

  In order to obtain Artifact Armor in Dawntrail, players will need to progress most of the way through the

  Main Scenario Quests. Completing the level 99 Main Scenario Quest "In Pursuit of Sphene" will unlock the armorer merchant
  <strong>
   Mewazunte in Tuliyollal (X:12.4, Y:12.9)
  </strong>
  , who provides players level 99 Artifact Armor for every job, completely free of charge, including a weapon, helmet, body armor, gloves, legs, and boots. Players will have to look to alternative sources like extreme trials, dungeons, or the tomestone vendors in Solution Nine (X:8.6, Y:13.6) to obtain the missing earring, necklace, bracelet, and ring equipment slots, or replace their Artifact Armor with further upgrades.

 <p>
  Artifact Armor in
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  takes advantage of the double dye channel system newly added to
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  , however, players won't be able to dye this armor without first completing some prerequisites.
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's Artifact Armor dye channels are locked until players complete the corresponding Role Quests, with each Role Quest Chain unlocking the dye channels for all Artifact Armor associated with that role.

  For example, players will need to complete the Tank Role Quests before they'll be able to dye the
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  Artifact Armor for tank jobs. These Role Quests are unlocked at level 92 after completing the Main Scenario Quest "The Feat of Pots", followed by the side quest "Uncouth Customers" in Tuliyollal (X:12.4, Y:14.5). Each Role Quest Chain can then be started by speaking with the appropriate quest giver around Tuliyollal (X:12.5, Y:15.0).

      <title>Why October is Ironically Both Good and Bad for Gaming's Spooky Season</title>

  Technically speaking, the first
  <strong>
   horror
  </strong>
  video game released all the way back in 1972 alongside the first console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Ever since then, horror has remained a staple genre in the gaming landscape, evolving from rudimentary haunted house games and text adventures to third-person survival horror games, to third-person action horror titles. Even now, some of the most well-regarded releases belong to the horror genre.

  With Halloween coming at the end of the month, October is often referred to as 'Spooky Season', and many gamers use this period as an opportunity to play through some of the best recent horror games. But ironically, October is usually both a great and tumultuous time for the horror gaming industry, and 2024's Halloween Season will likely be no different.

  October Has Always Been a Busy Month for Horror Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Naturally, with October being so synonymous with Halloween in the Western world, many publishers and developers try to release their horror games during the month, or just before it. In the last few years, more and more high-profile horror titles have started to drop in October. In 2022,
  <em>
   Scorn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Signalis
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  's Winters Expansion were all released in October, and last year, both
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Lethal Company
  </em>
  were released within mere days of one another.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1095} -->

 <p>
  On one hand, October becoming this hotbed for horror video game releases is a great thing for fans, as the more horror games release, the more fans have to play, which is especially exciting during Spooky Season. But on the other hand, multiple horror games releasing within the same short window can end up being detrimental to the games themselves. Even if October horror games are completely different from one another in terms of gameplay, story, and presentation, the fact they're all horror titles does inherently make them a little less individual, which can lead to less public attention, which can lead to lower sales.

  October 2024 Looks to be Another Hotbed for Horror
 </h3>
 <p>
  As things currently stand, it seems likely that October 2024 will be another double-edged period for horror video games.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  is set to launch at the beginning of October, and on the same day,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  <em>
   : Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  is also set to release. The
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  remake is set for a Fall release date, with some rumors suggesting it could land in October, and the Supermassive-helmed
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  spinoff
  <em>
   The Casting of Frank Stone
  </em>
  is also rumored to hit store shelves around the same time. While those releases would make October 2024 an incredible month for horror game fans, it probably wouldn't be great for the games themselves, each of which deserves its own time in the spotlight.

 <p>
  Even if
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Casting of Frank Stone
  </em>
  don't end up releasing in October,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  is still surrounded by some major horror titles. Just a month before
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  's release, the long-awaited
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  is finally coming to PC and consoles, and in early November,
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  is set to launch. Once again, 2024's Spooky Season is going to be a busy one, though hopefully, every game gets enough time to shine.

  An image claiming to show an early build of
  <strong>
   <em>
    BioShock 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has appeared online, revealing one of the very first looks at the long-awaited game. The original
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  was a massive success at the time of its release, launching to widespread critical acclaim and often pointed to as one of the absolute best games of all time. 2K capitalized on
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  's popularity with
  <em>
   BioShock 2
  </em>
  , a sequel that still earned a great deal of praise even if many believed it fell short of the original.

 <p>
  The third
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   BioShock Infinite
  </em>
  , was yet another hit, but it also kicked off the franchise's dormancy. No new
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  game has been released since
  <em>
   BioShock Infinite
  </em>
  launched in 2013, meaning fans have gone more than decade without a new entry in the series. While this is a bummer, the good news is that
  <em>
   BioShock 4
  </em>
  is in active development, even if 2K has yet to reveal anything substantial about the project.

  While
  <em>
   BioShock 4
  </em>
  has yet to have its official reveal, MP1st has discovered what is reportedly an image of the game from a showcase reel that was shown in 2021, speculated to have originated from a prototyping build. According to MP1st, the image was from a 2K Visual Effects Artist. The image is labeled as "Parkside Demo," with "Parkside" being a known codename for
  <em>
   BioShock 4
  </em>
  . It depicts a first-person view of a strange glowing structure, complete with a health bar, a green bar underneath the health bar, an hourglass ability icon in the top left, three abilities in the bottom left that will presumably be
  <em>
   BioShock 4
  </em>
  's Plasmids equivalent, and a gun called the Ricochet Shotgun. The scene takes place at night and the image is somewhat grainy, but for
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  fans who have been starved for information for years, it's likely still an exciting discovery.

      A Baldur's Gate 3 player online discovers the existence of raspberry bushes in-game after almost 400 hours of playtime.

      The raspberries are surprisingly powerful, as consuming them doesn't use an action or bonus action in combat.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  player online has made an incredibly helpful discovery in-game after spending almost 400 hours playing Larian's critically acclaimed RPG.
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  features a spectacular level of detail, which can lead to some things being easily missed by players.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's launch almost a year ago, the game has stunned players thanks to Larian's staggering attention to detail. One
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  player even noticed a hilarious detail in the game's credits, showing how these details extend beyond the actual gameplay, too. Because this level of detail is so impressive, it's easy for players to overlook things that are seemingly obvious after being discovered. This is why many of these details go undiscovered for so long - they're hiding in plain sight, seemingly as set dressing, just waiting for players to discover them.

  Redditor Cyberpunk39 made the surprising discovery that
  <em>

  </em>
  features

   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/bg3-food-raspberry-faded-1.png"/>
   Raspberry
  </span>
  bushes, which players are actually able to pick. These raspberries can then be used as Camp Supplies for Long Rests, allowing players to save their other resources. According to Cyberpunk39, they've put a total of 384 hours into
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , and have never once considered that these bushes were anything more than set dressing. One user pointed out another useful raspberry discovery from the game, claiming they actually heal the player when consumed, and can be used in combat without using an action or bonus action. This makes raspberries arguably better than any healing spell in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , and cements them as essential for any Honour Mode players.

   Honey Comb
  </span>
  was another item that some seemed surprised to have missed, as it's hidden around the world naturally, just like raspberries. There could be even more still undiscovered in Larian's RPG, and it might be a while yet until players have found everything the game has to offer.

  With Patch 7 set to arrive for
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  in September, it seems that Larian is preparing to move on from its 2023 hit. It has already been confirmed that Larian won't be producing any DLC for the game, so it'll be curious to see what route the studio takes next. Recently,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's Larian confirmed it previously wanted to make a
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  game, and it would be interesting to see whether that license becomes available again, given Bethesda's busy schedule for the next few years. No matter what, Larian has earned a legion of new fans with
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , who will be willing to try anything it develops next.

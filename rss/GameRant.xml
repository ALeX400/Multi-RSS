  introduces a new feature called Career Mode. Naturally, players are curious about the purpose of
  <strong>
   Career Mode
  </strong>
  and how it can provide more opportunities to enjoy the game's realistic flight simulation. Here’s everything you need to know.

  let you step into the shoes of a pilot. Now, with Career Mode, you can become part of the aviation industry—manage airplanes, run your own aviation service businesses, and build a collection of the world’s top aircraft. If that sounds intriguing, read on for more details.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  <strong>
   , Career Mode is a campaign feature
  </strong>
  that follows the story of an amateur pilot earning their Private Pilot License (PPL) and advancing to become a specialized aircraft operator and business owner in the aviation field.

 <p>
  The goal of Career Mode is to offer players a customized, personalized journey. Through this feature, players can take on millions of procedurally generated missions worldwide and start their own aviation service companies, including search &amp; rescue, cargo shipment, VIP charter services, and more.

 <h3 id="certifications">
  Certifications
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are over 20 certifications in Career Mode, each unlocking specific Specializations. These licenses are required to purchase and pilot different types of aircraft and commercialize your piloting skills. For example, to transport passengers for profit, you need the Charter Service certification.

 <h3 id="specializations">
  Specializations
 </h3>
 <p>
  Your certifications determine your Specialization. For instance, obtaining the Search &amp; Rescue certification makes it one of your specialties, with corresponding missions appearing on the overworld map.

 <h3 id="missions">
  Missions
 </h3>
 <p>
  Depending on your Specialization, different missions appear on the overworld map. These vary in objectives, durations, and rewards and are randomly generated across the map. Most missions are time-limited and refreshed periodically.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1090} -->

 <p>
  Missions are divided into
  <strong>
   standard and special
  </strong>
  , with special missions requiring more demanding prerequisites, involving complex aircraft, long transportation tasks, or challenging circumstances. They offer higher payouts and are an excellent way to farm Credits.

 <h3 id="companies">
  Companies
 </h3>
 <p>
  After earning enough Credits, you can invest in aviation businesses through the Companies tab. These businesses unlock more missions and generate passive income. To keep your company active, you must obtain the necessary licenses, maintain your aircraft, and uphold a good reputation by avoiding incidents and crashes.

      <title>A Sekiro 2 Would Need to Reconsider Its Approach to Upgrade Materials Wisely</title>

  FromSoftware’s

  is a significant departure from the traditional Soulsborne formula. The game emphasizes parrying-based combat and exploration over RPG-style leveling and one of the more contentious aspects of the game was its upgrade material system, which allowed players to enhance the capabilities of their prosthetic tools. While it is a nice cue to push people to explore the game and interact with merchants, actually finding the resources needed can be tedious.

 <p>
  While there is no confirmation of a sequel and a
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  follow-up seems like a far cry for now, it’s worth exploring how a potential sequel could reconsider the mechanics of upgrade materials to maintain the balance between challenge, reward, and pacing. Upgrade materials in a potential sequel, if ever there is one, needs to be far from the time-consuming obstacle it currently is.

  Tools like the Loaded Shuriken or Flame Vent could be upgraded into more powerful versions in the first installment. However, to upgrade
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  prosthetic tools and weapons like these, players need to collect rare materials, such as Scrap Iron or Lump of Grave Wax, often hidden in hard-to-reach areas or dropped by challenging enemies. As much as this system encouraged exploration and rewarded persistence, it introduced a grind-heavy aspect to a game for a mere weapon upgrade.

  While the extended gameplay may be rewarding for those willing to scour the world or repeatedly farm enemies, the grind often feels disproportionate to the benefits of the upgrades. Instead of forcing
  <em>
   Sekiro

  players to spend their time hunting for rare
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  materials, which are largely out of the way, a sequel should perhaps tone down on how many resources are needed, much less tone down the branching
  <strong>

  upgrade trees themselves.

  Farming for Rare Materials Doesn’t Fit Well in Sekiro

 <p>
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  thrives on exploration, environmental storytelling, and immersion in a sprawling, interconnected world. The game isn’t about repetitive farming or incremental upgrades to rank up at the end as is the case with most multiplayer games. The whole motivation lies in its ability to weave gameplay and storytelling into a cohesive experience. Forcing players to grind for materials as they would in a MOBA title dilutes this focus, regardless of how impactful upgrades can be when procured.

  If a
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  sequel were ever to materialize, a smarter approach to upgrading materials would go a long way. Instead of scattering materials in obscure locations or tying them to random enemy drops, the game could integrate them into structured challenges. For instance, only mini-bosses or specific side quests could yield these materials.
  <em>
   Sekiro 2
  </em>
  would also benefit greatly if it were to pull from titles like
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarök
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  , upgrades and resources are often tied to emotionally charged side quests, like aiding Freya in confronting her grief or uncovering the mysteries of forgotten realms, making progression feel like a natural story extension.
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  is definitely more character- and story-oriented than FromSoftware's action-RPGs and could take advantage of that by having optional questlines reap such rewards rather than having to commit to a New Game Plus grind.

  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  on the Wii earned critical acclaim at the time of its release, praised as a successful return of the beloved
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  sub-series. The game was later ported to the Nintendo 3DS with additional features, including an easier difficulty option and eight new levels. Now Nintendo is gearing up to release
  <em>
   DKCR
  </em>
  yet again, but this time with high-definition graphics on the Nintendo Switch.

  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD

  is scheduled to release for the Nintendo Switch on January 16, 2025. It's expected to be virtually identical to previous versions of the game, though GameXplain noticed a small but clever change. As spotted in
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  gameplay videos, the Donkey Kong statue that can be spotted in the background is holding a red Switch Joy-Con instead of a Wii remote. The statue held a Wii remote in the 3DS version of the game, too, so this change was made specifically for the new Switch release.

  Besides pointing out this neat Easter egg, the video seems to be poking fun at the fact that the footage of the Wii and Switch versions of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  look almost identical. While they will offer near 1:1 experiences in terms of gameplay, there are actually some important ways that
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  stands out from the Wii version. The HD graphics are the most obvious, but those that only played the Wii release and skipped the 3DS version may be tempted to pick up the Switch version for other reasons.

  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  could be considered the ultimate version of the game as it includes all the new content that was released for the 3DS port, including the eight new levels and easier difficulty options. It will also give home console players the chance to experience
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  without the divisive motion controls that were required for the Wii release. I personally never had a problem with the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  motion controls, but it's nice to have the option to play with more traditional controls. In any case, it will be interesting to see if there are any other smaller changes hidden throughout the Switch version of the game when it launches next month.

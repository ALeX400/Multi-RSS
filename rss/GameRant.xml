  brought Ellie and Joel's time to a harrowing end. After building a life at the Jackson compound together, Ellie's support system following his death was found in her friends, Dina and Jesse.
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  follows Ellie on her hunt for revenge against the ones responsible for Joel's death, and the help of Dina at her side makes the journey more bearable.

 <p>
  Ellie and Dina's relationship quickly blossoms into a romantic one, but a shock revelation that Dina is pregnant with Jesse's baby causes a major bump in the road for the duo on their journey. The result of this pregnancy is JJ. Following Jesse's death and the traumatic events of Ellie and Dina's time in Seattle, the two eventually return to a peaceful life on a farm. However, Ellie's lust for revenge eventually puts a rift between the couple, leaving Ellie and Dina's future uncertain by the end of the game. If Ellie reunites with Dina and JJ in
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  , the story has a chance to create a moment that mirrors Ellie's time with Joel.

  Paying Homage to an Iconic Moment From TLoU Part 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  is filled with an array of incredible and shocking moments. However, one of the most emotional scenes in the story involves a flashback of Joel and Ellie at a science museum. Joel encourages Ellie's love for space by taking her to the museum and setting up the opportunity for the two of them to simulate a space flight. The moment remains one of the most memorable in all
  <em>

  </em>

 <p>
  If Ellie takes on the role of a parental figure in JJ's life, then it's going to be difficult not to draw parallels between the two and Ellie and Joel. With growing hope that
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  becomes a reality, there are many questions that need to be answered. From Ellie's relationship with Dina and JJ to where Abby and Lev have ended up, the next game has a lot of ground to cover. Despite the unknown, Ellie and JJ deserve to form a bond in order to bring the story full circle.

     A recent Naughty Dog job listing for a Senior Gameplay Animator that emphasizes "creatures" has ignited speculation that

     is about to begin development.

 <p>
  There are downsides to making Ellie the new Joel, but serving as a parent in a seemingly doomed world would be fascinating to see through Ellie's perspective. JJ's dream and interests are a mystery at the moment, but Ellie's moment with Joel at the museum could inspire her to fulfill JJ's wishes similarly. After spending so much time with Joel, Ellie shares many of his qualities, and it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for her to be inspired by his parental instincts.

 <p>
  To say Ellie has been through a lot is an understatement. If
  <em>
   The Last of Us 3
  </em>
  sees the light of day, it will possibly be the last chapter in her story. If this is the case, then Ellie deserves to have a happy send-off as an opposing fate to Joel. Ellie, Dina, and JJ having a second chance at becoming a family could bring back the security Ellie lost after Joel's death.

 <p>
  It would be both an incredibly meaningful and bittersweet way of bringing the story around to mirror Joel and Ellie from the beginning. If Ellie fills Joel's shoes, she has a history with him that would help her correct his mistakes and bring a sense of closure.

  After redeeming the above-mentioned codes, players should try to earn Gems for achieving a certain speed, since this will also give them a good starting point. It is worth finding a slot machine with pets and buying some there, which will give players a little boost as well. After that, all they have to do is walk around and collect spheres, as well as jump through the rings. When players are confident enough in their abilities, they can participate in races.

  At any given moment, checking out a list of upcoming video games will show a slew of titles that gamers can expect to release at some point in the future. It might be that this excites people, or maybe it gives them an idea on what to spend some money on next (the prices of AAA games these days can mean starting some sort of five-year plan to make sure buying a new title doesn't also lead to bankruptcy). But with such a volume of games these days, it's also easy to feel overwhelmed by just how many are out there, especially when they're all vying for attention.

 <p>
  Maybe game burnout comes after playing a game with a really strong narrative or something with combat mechanics that just scratched an itch. Or maybe it's the opposite, and there's not really anything that has "gripped" a gamer of late. In any case, when
  <strong>
   feeling burned out on games, there are a few things to try
  </strong>
  to rekindle that love of gaming.

  Gaming is - more often than not - an indoor activity. Sure, the presence of handhelds on the market, like the Switch, means that this doesn't necessarily have to be the case, but sometimes, there's no other option but to sit back and relax at home with a game. This can be great, encouraging gamers to unwind, get lost in a game, not talk to anyone, and more. But perhaps people are getting burned out on games simply because their environment is so static.

 <p>
  An easy way to remedy this is to forget about the games for a second and focus on changing the environment. Take a walk down the street, get some fresh air, go to a park or a forest. Putting the phone away for a while and just trying to get as clear a mind as possible while focusing on what lies ahead can be incredibly refreshing. It might even give gamers the time to think of a new title to dive into.

  Books are not nearly as out of fashion as some people think. Every few months, the invisible hand of almighty Book-Tok guides a new generation of smut writers to frightening levels of acclaim. The Black Library and literary canon for titles like
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  show that a lot of video game settings (and tabletop settings that have also been turned into video game settings) are perfect candidates for novels. Fantasy titles and sci-fi epics can have just as much character and personality with some words on a page that million-dollar budget games strive to achieve.

  For those looking for a middle ground, some games are so text-heavy that they might as well be books. Change up the medium and see what a difference it makes for engagement. If the idea of reading something stirs emotions of fear, hatred, or memories of an insufficient school system that instilled a dislike of literature into entire generations, then consider it a challenge. Those who can 100%
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  can easily read a book.

  One of the inherently enticing things about multiplayer games is the social aspect that comes along with them. These games serve as ways to bring people together, unite them in a common purpose and activity - if only for a short while (or for 12 consecutive hours). But if games are starting to lose their luster, maybe it's time to try connecting with some friends. Bonding over similar interests - like games - will help relight that spark.

 <p>
  If friends are abroad or only accessible through social media, that's still a fine way to get a real, human conversation started up. The goal is to have some kind of human connection to make one's self feel more, well, human, after an extended bout of gaming.

  Games are made for entertainment - entertainment and leisure, ideally, but mainly entertainment. Part of the reason that people can get burned out from games, though, is the same reason why people get burned out from work or academia. There's always a mission: Save the princess, slay the dragon, kill the bad guy, hand in those papers by 5, hand in that essay by tomorrow, press X to pet the cat, etc. Moreso than just having something to do, maybe people are feeling tired from games setting these standards to meet over and over again. This is, of course, a totally natural means of game design, but the burn-out it can cause is still just as real.

  Thankfully, there are plenty of cozy games that don't have this kind of breakneck pace. Farming sims like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  take a much slower and gradual pace. There are plenty of low-stakes strategy titles that are built around relaxation, encouraging gamers to refrain from tearing their hair out when something like an attempt to industrialize a developing nation in
  <em>
   Victoria 3
  </em>
  goes wrong.

  Arguably the foundation of RPGs as people know them as today is the tabletop roleplaying scene. The new edition of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  has just been released, so it's the perfect time for a few friends to get together, draw straws to see who has to DM, and play some lighthearted
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  - or any of the other tabletop games that are out there. For fans of vampires,
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade
  </em>
  could be a the experience for them. Love
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  ?
  <em>
   Tales From The Loop
  </em>
  is set in a retro-futuristic 1980s, and all the PCs being between the ages of 11 and 15.

  Not too keen on the roleplaying side of tabletop RPGs? Plenty of smaller card games have massive decks to divide among players right out of the box for easy play. Have some money that was going to waste just sitting in that wallet anyway? Try
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000
  </em>
  , which is sure to have gotten a boost in popularity after the release of
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  . Games that aren't of the 'video' variety can hold some of the most exhilarating and unique experiences, especially for those burned out on digital titles.

      <title>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Cut Content Explained</title>

 <p>
  Video games rarely come out on the other side of development unscathed, as ideas that initially seemed plausible, doable, and intriguing end up being cut from the final version of the game.
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one game that was unable to avoid the editing scissors, just as it is with any other game. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  turned out to be a massive success anyway, which speaks well of Nintendo's decisions in the end.

 <p>
  Surprising as it may be,
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  ended up with several pieces of cut content before all was said and done. Some of this content is rather insignificant considering everything that did make it into the final game, but there are likely a few cut pieces that players might have wanted to see survive the cutting room floor. Included in the cut content for
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  are additional cooking and armor effects, additional mountable horses that could be registered at a stable, unused items that are indicated by missing names and present icons, and unused rooms in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  's Hyrule.

 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the less significant portions of cut content for
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  involves some additional cooking and armor effects that never made it into the final game. The two unused cooking effects, TwiceJump and EmergencyAvoid, currently exist in name only, with no indication left of what their effects entailed. However, it can be assumed that TwiceJump allowed Link to double-jump for a brief period, and perhaps EmergencyAvoid initially allowed Link to automatically evade a fatal blow while the effect was active.

 <p>
  An additional armor effect for
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  also never made it into the final game, although it was present in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  . The effect, AncientResistance, was applied to
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  's Ancient Armor set, which granted Link considerable damage resistance against Ancient weaponry. As
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  's version of the Ancient Armor set is not present in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , there is no reason for the effect to be implemented.

  Players Were Originally Allowed to Mount and Register Additional Horses in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
 </h3>
 <p>
  Perhaps the most significant portion of content that never made it into the final cut of
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  is that players were originally allowed to mount and register additional horses in the game. Firstly, in its current format, players can mount a Stalhorse in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  but are unable to register it at a stable. This is unfortunate, considering Stalhorses allow players to ride over Gloom without being harmed by it, but it also might have made the Depths a bit too easy to navigate.

 <p>
  Additionally, the Lord of the Mountain was originally a mount that could also be registered at a stable before the whole idea ended up on the cutting room floor. It was possible for players to mount the Lord of the Mountain in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , although they couldn't register it. In
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , however, players can only summon the Lord of the Mountain by offering fruit at one of the Satori Trees scattered throughout Hyrule. It then appears in a cutscene but cannot be mounted.

  Unused Icons and Names Suggest Some Items Never Made It Into Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

 <p>
  Another portion of cut content simply comes in the form of unused icons and names that suggest some items never made it into
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  's final build. Firstly, there is an unused Zonai Device Dispenser for
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  that had a 20% chance to drop a Beam Emitter, a 20% chance to drop a Sled, a 30% chance to drop a Mirror, a 15% chance to drop a Fan, and a 15% chance to drop a Small Wheel. Secondly, a missing item called "Energy_Material_02" suggests there was originally a Medium Crystallized Charge that provided a charge between the Regular and Large Crystallized Charges.

  An item called "Item_Ore_K" is missing from
  <em>

  's Paraglider fabrics never made it into the final game, but it's impossible to know what they were.

 <h3 id="several-rooms-went-unused-in-the-final-cut-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">
  Several Rooms Went Unused in the Final Cut of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are several unused rooms that
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  glitches and mods have granted players access to. At the top of Hyrule Castle's main tower, players can glitch through a closed door to find an unused room. There's also an unused room behind the Fashion Passion Shop in Gerudo Town in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . Despite both of these rooms being unused in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , however, they were both present in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and have retained their original models in the sequel.

 <p>
  There's also an unused cave in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  that was present and usable in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  . Players can find the cave near the Samasa Plain, out-of-bounds behind a rock wall. The cave was fully accessible in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , although it had nothing in it. These unused areas in
  <em>
   T ears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  are clear evidence that Nintendo used
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  's model of Hyrule and simply altered it to fit
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  's narrative.

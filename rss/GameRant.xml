   <strong>
    Diablo 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  (brought back from oblivion as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Diablo 2: Resurrected
   </strong>
  </em>
  ) has tons of interesting aspects that make it one of the most important entries in the series. With six titles published (counting
  <em>
   Diablo: Immortal
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   D2R
  </em>
  ) is is not hard to recognize that this is one of the biggest franchises in the history of Blizzard Entertainment. With millions of fans all over the world, Diablo has become iconic, and with its latest entry,
  <em>
   Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , players have accumulated tons of experience slaying demons and other vicious creatures that plague Sanctuary.

  Now, there's a debate ongoing, with Diablo 2 and Diablo 4 being the top, most played titles (or at least, the ones that have a greater number of active players): Which one of them is the best? To clarify this, we've come up with a list that highlights five things that Diablo 2 does way better than Diablo 4. Considering mechanics, character building, storytelling, and other aspects of this ARPG classic.

  When
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  was still in diapers,
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  had already amassed an impressive amount of possible builds for its core classes, and now, with the inclusion of the Warlock to the mix, even more so. With hundreds of Unique Items, Set Items, and the coveted Runewords, the possibilities are nearly endless. Some builds are good for farming, some are good to take down the most dangerous enemies of Sanctuary, and others are so ridiculously broken that even a goldfish could slay Diablo in Hell using them.

   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​on the other hand, holds the advantage in terms of graphics and effects: indeed, the visual impact of the series (or its gore) has increased over the years. But, as mentioned before,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  doesn't have the same number of items, or classes, nor enough space for buildcraft to consider itself better than
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  . At least not in that aspect. And then, looking back at
  <em>
   Diablo 2: Resurrected,
  </em>
  if things keep going the right way, we could be looking forward to that gap between both games' buildcraft growing bigger and bigger. Only time will tell.

  The New System is Okay, But The Classic One Is Still Superior

  Runewords are a gimmick that only three games of the series have:
  <em>
   Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction,
  </em>
  its
  <em>
   Resurrected Version
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred.
  </em>
  This system, originally introduced with
  <em>
   LOD
  </em>
  escalated into one of the most notorious and beloved gimmicks in the franchise. Players all over the world went on a hunt for the best runes to build powerful gear and weapons. This notoriously increased replay value for the game, since the Rune system in
  <em>
   D2
  </em>
  went by tiers. Basic runes dropped in Normal, but advanced ones only in Nightmare and Hell difficulties. A similar case happens in
  <em>
   Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , since this expansion (Season 11)
  <strong>
   brought back Runes
  </strong>
  to the mainline games (although, to be fair, they never left).

 <p>
  In any case: The Rune system of Diablo 4 depends on a series of strict rules (like being unable to equip the same rune twice, or having a
  <strong>
   maximum of two Runewords equipped
  </strong>
  at the same time), plus, it is a standalone system which doesn't depend on equipment sockets, but instead, are socketed on a special section of the Character menu. Besides, Runes in Diablo 2 are much more attractive both in terms of power scaling and effects. So, it is clear that
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  also has the upper hand in terms of Runewords.

 <p>
  Even though
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has introduced ultimate skills to the mix, and its focus on original classes like the Barbarian, the Druid, and the Sorcerer are top-notch, there's something that it lacks: Real power and that brutal snowball effect that came with maxing out skills, stats, and damage output, something that only
  <em>
   D2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   D2:Resurrection
  </em>
  managed to accomplish. Plus, the original classes are extremely versatile, both in terms of builds and potential to solo the end-game content. But ever since
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  hit the gaming world, there has been an increasing tendency to balance out every single character in the game to make it just enough powerful to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite having some good synergies and builds that can be used for carrying or farming, Diablo 4 is closer and closer to becoming a multiplayer game by design, and that's okay. But, this doesn't change the fact that
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  classes are way better both in terms of power, survivability, and snowballing potential. However, it is worth mentioning that
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's next expansion (
  <em>
   Lord of Hatred
  </em>
  ) could even the playing field by introducing both the Warlock and the Paladin. With that, both games could have a similar roster, so it might be possible to subject them to comparison again to see if
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  classes become closer to what they used to be (or better).

 <p>
  The story of
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  actually begins way before the events that led to the resurrection of the three Prime Evils. It is the story of the Dark Wanderer (formerly known as Prince Aidan, and the Warrior from Diablo I) and how his struggle to free Khanduras from the influence of Diablo ends up with him corrupted and turned into the new Vessel of the Prime Evil. The narrative flow and the events that follow up to the fall of Tristan are then told in
  <em>
   Diablo 2,
  </em>
  which turns into a wild hunt against the wandering possessed prince, while the heroes fight tooth and nail against hordes of demons. The epic conclusion begins in Travincal, with the heroes purging the corrupted Zakarum, and slaying Mephisto. Then, descending to Hell following Diablo, to beat him as well, destroying both Soul Stones at the Hell Forge. In Lord of Destruction, the epic conclusion to this story, players face absolute annihilation, as Baal has unleashed his horde in an attempt to corrupt the Worldstone. So, as players who have experienced this game firsthand would know, the battle for Mount Arreat and its outcome is an epic conclusion to the game's main story.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Diablo 4,
  </em>
  the story is much slower, and the pacing starts awkwardly as players are introduced to the Cult of Lilith and continue the story of the Nephalem of
  <em>
   Diablo 3.
  </em>
  Since the game is more focused on exploration and has tons of side-activities to discover, that also alters the flow of the narrative. While in
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  , things were more direct, and the quests pushed the players naturally into becoming stronger and facing increasingly difficult opponents, in
  <em>
   Diablo 4,
  </em>
  the story is more focused on exploration, and the focus is more open-world-like. Showcasing the main antagonist of the story right away also diminishes the impact, and the story doesn't have the heartbreaking twist of
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  (Adria's betrayal and Leah's transformation into the Lord of Terror). So, less impactful, less meaningful goals, and a plot that is diluted until 'The Mysterious Wolf' appears and begins to knead a sub-plot that becomes a bit more interesting than stopping Lilith and her cult.
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  has proven to be superior time and time again, and in terms of storytelling, it beats
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  by a landslide.

 <p>
  Both
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  are incredibly engaging games; there's no denying that fact. However, their focus is like day and night.
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  is an
  <strong>
   <em>
    ARPG
   </em>
   with a co-op mode
  </strong>
  and a PvPvE focus, while
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's focus is a
  <strong>
   multiplayer live-service kind of game
  </strong>
  . While
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  retains that charm of beating the game and starting all over to challenge it in a new difficulty level (not to mention all the Uber-bosses included in the post-game), it's replay value is more that of a game that needs to keep the audience engaged forcibly through endless in-game events, a season pass, and a similar criteria that was molded in the era of
  <em>
   Diablo 3:
  </em>
  New
  <strong>
   Seasonal Challenges

  as an
  <strong>

  On the other side,
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  's core values are grinding, building a stronger character, more grinding, and challenging impossible odds in three successive runs, which
  <strong>
   escalate in difficulty considerably
  </strong>
  . And considering that every character in
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  has a certain utility to help players gain the most powerful items, charms, and Runewords (especially the Sorceress and the Necromancer), its replay value increases exponentially. And that, without mentioning the co-op mode that can be enjoyed by up to eight players, which increases the difficulty level instead of making it less complicated, since enemies are empowered each time a new player joins a session. It has a certain charm that
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  was not able to imitate, despite its best efforts. Now, with
  <em>
   Diablo 2: Resurrected
  </em>
  , these
  <strong>
   differences are even more notorious
  </strong>
  . So, dear readers, this might be your cue to try both titles and see for yourselves which one is best.

      <title>God of War Sons of Sparta Review: A Forgettable PS5 Exclusive</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-review/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Perhaps the biggest surprise coming out of the recent PlayStation State of Play was the shadow-drop of
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War Sons of Sparta
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a 2D Metroidvania game from Santa Monica Studio and Mega Cat Studios. On paper, it seemed like a smart decision for a beloved video game IP, keeping
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  active and at the forefront of players' minds, while Santa Monica works on the remakes and next mainline entry. There's lower inherent risk, at least in some cases, and it allows developers to be more experimental with the property. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, with a plethora of benefits for expanding a beloved IP with smaller games in beloved genres. Unfortunately, for everything in its favor,
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  lands far less than it should.

  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
    God of War Sons of Sparta
   </em>
   's gameplay exists within an interesting narrative frame: Kratos tells his daughter, Calliope, a story from his youth in which he and his brother, Deimos,
  </span>
  truly learn the meaning of duty. It ties well into Kratos' background, and it introduces a new aspect of Kratos' character: his youth. But some stories are better left untold. Kratos does not feel like Kratos in this flashback game, save for the narration by original Kratos actor TC Carson, and this is only made worse by the basic art style.
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  is not going to impress anyone visually, but if it did elsewhere, then it would be a completely different story. The basic art style, however, is more emblematic of the experience than it is a minor drawback.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything about
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  could be summarized as "basic." There is no major experimentation within the genre, with the gameplay, with the story, with the characters, or with anything. That bleeds through into everything. And while
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  does deliver some strong moments despite this basic approach, they are far and few between.

  God of War Sons of Sparta Barely Fits the Metroidvania Genre
 </h2>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  is described as a Metroidvania game, I'd argue that "2D action-platformer with Metroidvania elements" is more accurate. It's a small distinction, but one that completely adjusts expectations for the gameplay experience. The core traits of a Metroidvania game include a large, interconnected world map that builds upon itself, where abilities lock progression and encourage exploration and backtracking. The best Metroidvania games push exploration over a linear story, letting players find or discover upgrades or story developments organically. And, of course, movement is a key component of any Metroidvania.

  <em>

  drops the ball on nearly every front. Its map is large and theoretically interconnected, but not in any way that matters. The areas do not build on each other and instead feel oddly cobbled together. And while there is some expected backtracking, it is not encouraged by the game.
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  does have some DPS/skill checks in the form of bosses, but mastery of its systems far exceeds the benefit of any singular upgrade. What's more, navigating to any area on foot is a major pain, and the fast travel is severely limited in the game until it arbitrarily isn't.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abilities can and do lock progression, but in the most minute of ways. There's rarely a moment when players unlock a new ability, a Gift from Olympus, and feel like they are better prepared to tackle any part of the map. Exploration is important to go ahead and grab upgrades in
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  , but that's about it. In fact, the game will prevent the player from exploring or backtracking a few times throughout the run.

  also emphasizes a linear story, one somewhat worsened by forcing players to sit through slow dialogue. There's no skip option, and Kratos and Deimos essentially have the same conversation throughout the game, until Kratos magically changes his mind. There's a brotherly aspect to it, but it's the same brotherly conversation, argument, and acquiescence until the two eventually agree.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's why I say the genre distinction matters.
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  's map features some Metroidvania-like elements, but it feels more like an old 1990s or 2000s action platformer than a modern Metroidvania. Movement and positioning become key, though, as that's perhaps its best defining feature. Understanding Kratos' movement in attack combos, his positioning on the map, how enemy attack patterns unfold, and similar movement strategies are necessary for mastery in the game. This does grow, however slim, throughout a playthrough. Enemies and bosses will encourage more directional attacks, and equipment/upgrades can and do change certain player strategies, but it's still incredibly basic for most of the runtime.

  Around the halfway point, the game gets better and more challenging. The first half is essentially Baby Kratos in elementary school, while the second half feels more like Teenage Kratos in high school.
  <em>

  </em>
  's various bosses begin to test and skill check players better, while areas level more environmental challenges and puzzles against the player. But at the end of the day, it's all about a player's ability to attack, dodge, heal, and jump. Had

  gotten to its second half faster and continued to develop that further, it would be a much better game.

  While the moment-to-moment gameplay will influence your enjoyment, the world of

  has plenty to keep players active. Beyond acquiring upgrades by completing Olive Trees and the like, players can gather lore and owls, find the Mosaic and Gorgon Doors, and face a couple of optional boss fights.

  's co-op mode is also limited to post-game content that finds itself as basic as the rest of the game. If someone can accept the basic nature of many of its activities, then there's plenty to keep them busy. Most of these do not feel too great, more like a barebones collect-a-thon than anything. Perhaps that is the biggest win and loss for

  God of War Sons of Sparta is a Prime Example of Playing It Too Safe
 </h2>
 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  plays it too safe, as if Mega Cat Studios and Santa Monica were afraid to rock the boat. Nothing is necessarily bad about the game, but neither is anything particularly good. It feels mostly detached from its genre and story, with weak anchors in Metroidvania gameplay or the
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  franchise. In fact, only a moment or two are connected to the franchise at all, and those moments could be better encapsulated in something like a canon comic book. Kratos and Deimos could be replaced with any other Spartans in the world, and nothing would need to change about the game to make it work.

  <em>
   God of War Sons of Sparta
  </em>
  is an okay prequel—the problem is that it feels like it was released before the original 2005 game, not just taking place before it. Its safe approach feels like a game made generations ago, not one released in 2026, and makes it a chapter in Kratos' life that is forgettable.

  Pulling no punches, the first time you encounter an enemy in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  , you are thrust into one of the game's many boss fights — Mia Winters, the deranged wife of protagonist Ethan Winters. It's revealed she has horrifying abilities, and she's turning them your way.

 <p>
  There are two phases to fighting Mia in
  <em>

  . The first, easier fight takes place in the hallway that connects to the basement, and the second fight occurs in the attic — this is when things get a lot tougher. Here's how to beat Mia in

 <p>
  The first fight with Mia in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  takes place in the hallway that connects to the basement. At this stage of the game, Ethan has absolutely nothing to defend himself with, so all you can do is pull the right trigger as prompted to try to stop Mia's vicious attacks. Shortly after this sequence, Mia will fall to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approach Mia's motionless body to trigger a scene where she throws Ethan through the nearby wall. At this point, Ethan will collect an axe to use it as a weapon against Mia. This is where the actual boss battle begins, as you have to
  <strong>
   time your swings to stop Mia's advances
  </strong>
  . Instead of just rushing Mia and swinging wildly with the axe, wait for her to get ready for an attack of her own, and then cancel it by slamming the axe into her body. Hit Mia with the axe until she collapses again, and Phase 1 is over.

 <p>
  Phase 2 of Mia's boss fight starts when you get to the attic of the Guest House. Upon arriving there, collect the Handgun from the table, and walk around the attic picking up all the Handgun ammo lying around — you're going to need it. Once all the ammo has been collected, go to the ladder in the back that leads to the attic window.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you climb to the top of the ladder, a chainsaw-wielding Mia will greet you and Phase 2 will begin. Quickly drop down from the ladder and
  <strong>
   put some distance between you and Mia
  </strong>
  . She will mostly walk slow during this portion of the fight, but she will occasionally make some deadly charges with the chainsaw. The trick is to
  <strong>
   headshot her
  </strong>
  while keeping a distance between you and Mia, and it's also advantageous to
  <strong>
   have some objects in the way as well, like crates and posts
  </strong>
  .

  Of course, Mia will destroy anything in her way, but the time it takes her to do this leaves her wide open to headshots from your handgun. And, it gives you valuable time that can be spent getting away from Mia so she can't land any swipes from her chainsaw. Just a few hits from the chainsaw is enough to end Ethan's life in a rather gruesome fashion, so avoiding it is paramount to success in this boss fight — especially while playing on Madhouse difficulty in

  Every few headshots will be enough to stun Mia, whereas it seems to take five to six body shots to achieve the same effect. Essentially, the key to this battle is simply shooting Mia, while running away before she hits you, until Mia finally succumbs to her wounds. However, be warned that it will take a few clips to accomplish this.

  Gems let you hatch pets that make dice rolls luckier, so you snag rare baddies quicker. Golden dice shine brightest, giving higher chances at legendaries that boost plots hugely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who are just starting build dream teams without boring grinds, placing baddies everywhere for offline riches. Even after rebirths, extras refresh luck for new adventures, like potion hunts or weather events. They keep things fair, helping players catch up.

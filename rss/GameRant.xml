   <em>
    Legend of Slime
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a cute, simple, yet addictive idle RPG with a bunch of mechanics that will grab your attention for hours, maybe even days. In many games, slimes are the weakest enemies, being the initial ones, but
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  breaks all the standards. Here, the slime plays the protagonist's role, fighting against evil people who rise up on the way. Throughout the game, you'll need to level up your slime, get new weapons, armor, and even companions, but all of this requires Gems, the local premium currency. By redeeming
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  codes, you'll get a bunch of Gems, which will be enough to properly equip your character, especially if you're a beginner.

  Even without an excessive amount of Gems, the game is easy and fast, but getting new cool equipment or companions is also nice, especially since it gives a good advantages. Manually accumulating currency can be a bit time-consuming, so the best method is to redeem
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  codes, which will bring you tons of Gems in seconds.

  <em>
   Pizzeria Tycoon 2
  </em>
  is one of the classic representatives of the tycoon games. In it, you will have to serve guests and sell pizza to earn money. Of course, the more you invest in upgrades, the more you automate passive income. But first, players will have to do everything manually. To speed up this process, you will need
  <em>
   Pizzeria Tycoon 2
  </em>
  codes.

 <p>
  As we said, each of these codes will reward you with useful free goodies, such as Cash or boosters. The latter are especially useful, as they help to significantly increase income, regardless of the stage of development of your restaurant. However, we do not recommend that you delay their use, since each code has a set expiration date.

  “Black Leg” Vinsmoke Sanji is one of the fiercest members of the Straw Hat Pirates. Like his crew mates, Sanji has not only grown emotionally and mentally over the course of
  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but expanded his power levels to extremes with the introduction of Haki and Diable Jambe. However, not every one of Sanji’s powers has been showcased in
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  ’s many video game adaptations.

 <p>
  With the Wano Arc of
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  officially over in both manga and anime, it wouldn’t be surprising to see aspects of Sanji’s powers from the arc finally make it into a video game adaptation. The same can be said for the Whole Cake Island Arc, which featured Sanji as one of the central protagonists. Both arcs see Sanji broadening his power set with a new dangerous power up introduced and the expansion of one of his signature moves.

  In the midst of the Zou and Whole Cake Island arcs, it is revealed that Sanji’s origins are not from the East Blue, but rather from the North. Born to King Vinsmoke Judge, Sanji is the third son of Judge and prince of Germa. He and his siblings were experimented on in the womb to remain cold emotionless killers. Though all members of the Vinsmoke family are immensely powerful on their own, as commanders of super group Germa 66, the family uses special suits to enhance their powers.

  Raid suits in O
  <em>
   ne Piece
  </em>
  have some general abilities: the suits are fire-resistant, the capes of the suits are bullet-proof, and the suit’s boots have accelerators on the heels and flotation devices in the soles. They're also intended to enhance the user's natural powers and abilities; Sanji is shown easily crushing the canister of a raid suit easily with one stomp, though it is well-known that his feet are his most powerful weapons.

 <p>
  Sanji’s powers were thought to have been dormant both by his family, as shown by the immense childhood abuse they inflicted upon him in response, and by himself. Despite his supposed lack of powers, a raid suit was made by Germa 66 for Sanji. He eventually comes across the raid suit canister and disavows using it until he reaches Wano.

  What Soba Mask Offered to Sanji
 </h3>
 <p>
  Donning his black raid suit, Sanji notices that it seems to reawaken the dormant experimentation that Judge had afflicted on him and his mother in utero. Sanji is now able to fly and strengthen his kicks with the propelled boots of the suit. Like the other suit wearers, Sanji gains a unique enhancement from the suit: invisibility.

 <p>
  Sanji uses his newfound invisibility to surprise attack his opponents and later to sneak out Nami, Robin, and Shinobu and to rescue Kozuki Momonosuke during the raid on Onigashima. Sanji quickly recognizes that the suit is similar to a fictionalized version of Germa 66 found in the comic series “Sora, Warrior of the Sea”. Rather than naming his raid suit form Stealth Black, after his comic counterpart, Sanji rejects this name and calls himself 0-Soba Mask. He eventually destroys the raid suit canister, once again rejecting Germa and his birth family.

  Soba Mask's Possible Future in One Piece Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though the raid suit is featured as wearable DLC by Luffy in
  <em>
   One Piece: World Seeker
  </em>
  , he gains no additional powers by wearing it. This seems to be consistent with mainline
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  games released after the conclusion of Whole Cake Island. It should be noted that Soba Mask is a playable character in
  <em>
   One Piece: Bounty Rush
  </em>
  , a mobile 4v4 action game, but this seems to be the only appearance of him as a playable character.

 <p>
  Soba Mask still has yet to be featured in a
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  mainline game at the same level as
  <em>
   One Piece: World Seeker
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  , leaving this part of Sanji’s history extremely underutilized. The raid suit’s invisibility could act as an incredible ultimate ability in combat games or could be a useful recon skill in games more closely resembling
  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  .

  The powers of Germa 66 aren’t the only aspects of Sanji’s power set that have yet to be adapted to video games. An expansion of one of Sanji’s signature moves has yet to be seen in video games. Though Sanji’s “Diable Jambe” is used quite frequently both in mainline
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  games and in games featuring him outside the franchise, his “Ifrit Jambe” has yet to receive the same treatment.

 <p>
  After the raid suit awakened Sanji’s inert abilities, Sanji accepted these new abilities he had gained while destroying the suit itself. By combining his newfound powers with his old ones, Sanji developed new techniques from his Black Leg style with names that still maintain his flair. Ifrit Jambe burns brighter and hotter than Diable Jambe. By combining his exoskeleton with Armament Haki, Sanji’s legs are able to withstand the hotter blue flames of Ifrit Jambe compared to the fiery red of Diamble Jambe. His new enhanced speed and the weight behind his kicks also increases the power of Ifrit Jambe.

 <p>
  Though it may not be as flashy as Germa 66’s raid suit, Ifrit Jambe should be a power set used in
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  mainline games going forward, not just because this power set is more powerful than Sanji’s previous, but because Sanji himself will likely use this power set more often than Diable Jambe. These newfound powers represent a shift in Sanji as a character, and video game adaptations should take note of this shift and respect it.

  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece

  </strong>
  remains far from over and, therefore, the growth Sanji’s power set may receive still has yet to be seen. Nevertheless, video game adaptations of the franchise should heed these changes and adapt alongside the franchise, especially with one of its most powerful characters.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As the name suggests,
  <em>
   RNG Combat Simulator
  </em>
  combines certain types of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  games as RNG and Simulators. Therefore, players must roll various Auras to increase stats and fight other players for Stars. But, since at first, you will only come across the most common Auras, it is quite difficult to progress. To fix this, you should use
  <em>
   RNG Combat Simulator
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":361} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":200,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: featured video below first paragraph! -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->
 <p>
  With the help of codes, players can get free goodies in this
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  experience in just a couple of clicks. And, some of them will reward you with many valuable Stars. But, if you do not hurry, the codes will expire, and their rewards will no longer be available.

  Most of the time, you will be rolling Auras in
  <em>
   RNG Combat Simulator
  </em>
  . The rarer Auras you get, the more your stats will increase. But in addition to this, players will need Pets that increase multipliers. They can be obtained in exchange for Stars. However, the latter is only earned by battling in the style of Mountain Dawn on a separate island. Luckily, there is a way to get Stars from the very beginning much easier, namely
  <em>
   RNG Combat Simulator
  </em>
  codes.

 <p>
  Each code offers you a different number of Stars, from 50 to 1,500. So, even a few of them will help you get rare pets before your first battle. However, the codes are active for a limited time. So, you should use them while they are still valid.

  Developer by Wrong Organ,
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  is a psychological first-person horror game that follows a crew of a shipwrecked space freighter. The game's description paints it best, claiming that players can "Follow the lives of the crew as they weather starvation, isolation, and each other," promising immersive storytelling and psychological scares. It does all of this with a unique PSX-esque graphics style, giving the game a unique nostalgic feel. In the wake of
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  's release, players have taken to Steam's review section to show their appreciation for the game.

  Almost two weeks on from its launch,
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  on Steam has already been given the label of "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews. Games must garner at least 500 reviews before they can be awarded this title, with a minimum of 95% of them being positive. At the time of writing,
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  has over 1,500 positive reviews, a huge achievement for a niche horror game. Currently,
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  doesn't have enough critic reviews to have a Metascore on review aggregate site Metacritic. However, it does have a user score of 9.0, indicating it's one of the highest-rated games of 2024 at the moment.

  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  continues a trend of positive reviews for both its developer and publisher. Wrong Organ has one previous title under its belt, 2022's
  <em>
   How Fish is Made
  </em>
  , which also received "Overwhelmingly Positive" Steam reviews. Meanwhile, CRITICAL REFLEX has never published a game that received less than "Mostly Positive" reviews, a record that improves to "Very Positive" when excluding its first two games. It's great to see smaller studios creating unique experiences that take chances with their mechanics. In the case of
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  , Wrong Organ may have produced one of the best psychological horror games around.

  <em>

  is currently available at a 10% discount on Steam, giving early adopters a chance to pick up the game for $11.69 rather than the usual $12.99 price. This deal is available until October 10, so any gamers interested still have a few days to take advantage of
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  's lower price. It could be the perfect time to pick up another spooky game to play this Halloween. If the "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews are any indication, it's well worth a try.

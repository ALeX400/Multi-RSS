  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    GTA Online
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has shared their experience of making a new character in the game only to be mowed down by another player within seconds of joining. While the series is known for its chaos and crime, the
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  player wasn't expecting to get killed quite this fast.

 <p>
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  amplifies the mayhem of a standard single-player
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games just due to the behavior of players. In addition to missions that actively encourage players to sabotage one another, many players regularly grief others just for the sake of it. It seems that this particular player spawned with bad luck, as it didn't take them more than a moment to run into a
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  griefer.

 <p>
  Reddit user and
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  player GTA_endgame_player shared their story of making a new character in the game with the intention of playing a crime-free run. A brief video shared shows them putting the finishing touches on their character and loading into a public lobby. In the first five seconds, another player comes barreling through traffic a short distance away before pausing, seemingly noticing GTA_endgame_player's character standing there. GTA_endgame_player turns to start walking away, but the player follows, pulls their car up alongside them, and tosses a sticky bomb down, promptly detonating it and driving off. The entire debacle takes place over the span of just fifteen seconds from start to finish.

  GTA Online Players Commiserate About Random Killing
 </h2>
 <p>
  Many other
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  players have shared their amusement at the scene, though some also felt some pity for the player. One joked that technically, GTA_endgame_player had already failed their no-crime run, as they promptly pulled out a pistol while standing on the street, which they joked that their character obviously didn't have any kind of license to carry. Others made fun of the continuing long loading times of
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  , as the player spent significantly more time waiting for their character to spawn into the world than they actually got to play for before being killed.

 <p>
  Some fans questioned the reasoning behind trying to do a crime-free run. GTA_endgame_player explained that they've already got another character that's reached nearly 100% on career progress, own all the businesses, and are approaching rank 750, so this is just a fun side experience they decided to try. Thankfully, this also means that the player knew exactly what to expect from the
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  community, so they seem to be viewing this experience with amusement rather than frustration. As numerous fans have pointed out, if the random acts of violence get to be too much, they can always enable passive mode or join a private lobby.

  Fans were disappointed when
  <strong>
   <em>
    Game of Thrones
   </em>
  </strong>
  came to an end and had to say a tearful farewell to Westeros. Although
  <em>
   House of the Dragon

  <em>

  books, but a handful of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Game of Thrones

   The Game of Thrones franchise is arguably one of the most popular of the last 20 years. Not only did it revolutionize the way Drama series around medieval times were told, but also opened the door for other projects and endless spin-offs, like House of the Dragon, which just closed its second season earlier this year.

  <em>
   While the Winds of Winter novel by George R.R. Martin is still being written and fans await it patiently, players and fans of the franchise can, in the meantime, turn to the original series once more to relive their favorite moments, or, alternatively, play one of the games on this list to return to Westeros.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Game of Thrones: Conquest
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mobile strategy-building game released in 2017, shortly after Season 7 came to a close. This game took mechanics from games like
  <em>
   Clash Of Clans
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Game Of War
  </em>
  and applied them to
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  . Still, beneath the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  skin, this is a familiar game that avid mobile gamers will have played before.

 <p>
  Players are tasked with building a kingdom and forging alliances, starting by building farms and barracks before going on to command troops, raise a dragon, and even collect “heroes” from the show. The quests given by Tyrion Lannister himself make the game fun and addictive at first, but soon feel limited with little to keep them interested, other than upgrading buildings. Some players complain about glitches and bugs, but their biggest problem is often how the best features are hidden behind a paywall.

  This
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  game came out just as Season 2 of the TV show finished, just managing to catch the start of its immense popularity. Although a step up from the tie-in game released the previous year,
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  remains an interesting but flawed entry, despite a cameo by George R.R. Martin himself.

 <p>
  The story on its own makes this game worth it, however. Taking place during Season 1, the game follows two characters: knight Alester Sarwyck and Night’s Watch ranger Mors Westford, each with great backstories and character development. However, it’s the gameplay that ultimately lets this title down. With
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings
  </em>
  released just one year earlier,
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  should have fit in with these titles seamlessly. However, frequent bugs, awkward combat, and limited character models let down the excellent story hidden within an action-adventure game many fans found lackluster.

  Film and TV tie-in games were starting to disappear around the time that
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  first aired way back in 2011, but there were still a few around.
  <strong>
   <em>
    A Game of Thrones: Genesis
   </em>
  </strong>
  came out just a few months after the first season finished airing, largely intended to bring in more fans to promote the show.

 <p>
  Sadly, although it offered some more Westeros adventures for fans to enjoy and included some novel real-time strategy mechanics, this strategy game was not well received by fans or critics. Players select a house, each with its special abilities, and go on to capture castles and towns until they obtain enough prestige to win the Iron Throne. Ultimately, many found this game repetitive with overly confusing mechanics.

  As its name implies,
  <em>

  </em>
  takes place hundreds of years before the events of
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  and even
  <em>
   House of the Dragon

  Set before the events of the

  TV show, players assume the role of Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch shortly after the previous one disappeared. The plot revolves around discovering what happened to the previous commander “beyond the wall,” hence the title. The gameplay largely revolved around grid-based battles using characters with special abilities and using XP to upgrade heroes and their gear. Players could let battles play out automatically, but challenges were included to make it more interesting.

  Since this game was released after
  <em>

  </em>
  ended, it's best to play it after watching all eight seasons. However, the game is largely independent of the main story, so unless fans don't want to meet characters they haven't seen yet, it's safe to play as soon as they finish
  <em>
   Game of Thrones: Season 1

  Bigpoint had originally planned to use the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  license to develop an MMORPG called
  <em>
   Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms
  </em>
  . However, plans changed when they were acquired by Yoozoo Games and instead produced
  <strong>
   <em>
    Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Advertised widely upon its release, this is a browser MMO mixed with a kingdom management simulator, featuring well-known characters from the show and famous locations, from King’s Landing to Winterfell.

  The game is set in a slightly alternate universe where all seven kingdoms separate after the death of Ned Stark. Players become the Lord or Lady of a Westerosi kingdom, tasked with training soldiers, managing their surroundings, and making alliances. With some impressive visuals, the gameplay is a mix of strategy and roleplay as players build their base, expand territory, and recruit fan-favorite characters. The game garnered mixed reviews, however, and although players enjoyed the graphics and ability to develop their kingdom, they became frustrated with constant timers, a lack of engaging combat, and key features hidden behind paywalls.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows

  is very simple to look at. There’s not much in the way of visuals; the environment is just an animated square, albeit with some intricate drawings packed with personality. But that’s okay since this game is all about the narrative. In many ways,
  <em>
   Tale of Crows
  </em>
  seems more like an interactive novel where players make occasional choices.

  This is a text-based adventure game combined with a management simulator. Players are put in charge of the Night’s Watch, guiding the Lord Commander in responding to events around the Wall. It’s a narrative idle game where players send rangers on expeditions from Castle Black and receive notifications whenever there’s an update, tasked with responding to problems, making allies, and avoiding enemies.

  Telltale’s
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  entry came out at just the right time when the hype for the series was at its highest. Telltale was also coming off a run of successful games, such as
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Wolf Among Us
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Tales From The Borderlands
  </em>
  . This game doesn’t retell any of the story from the main series, but instead inserts new characters into the same world. Although never mentioned in the show, players follow these characters alongside the main
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  plot, witnessing famous events like the Red Wedding and meeting familiar faces, like Tyrion and Cersei Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Margaery Tyrell.

  As with all Telltale games, the gameplay is all about quick-time events and making crucial choices for characters, whether it’s what to say, who to make an alliance with, and who to save. All these choices matter and this works perfectly in the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  world where who you make friends with can make the difference between life and death. Dialogue is often the strongest aspect of the show and Telltale capitalizes on this, making their game story-driven and engaging throughout. Although the second season was announced, it was canceled when the studio closed in 2018. Fortunately, Telltale is back now, and fans are eagerly hoping for a new season.

  Telltale's game starts with the Red Wedding, so fans shouldn't start playing this game until they've finished watching

   <strong>
    Game of Thrones: Ascent
   </strong>
  </em>
  was the franchise's first
  <em>
  </em>
  mobile game, and it set something of a trend since nearly all subsequent projects have been Android or iOS releases. This game was also a Facebook web browser game for those who didn’t have a powerful enough phone back in 2013.

  The King awards the player with a small holding of land and makes them the head of a minor house. From there, it’s up to the player how to grow. They train armies, manage buildings, and navigate alliances as they battle to become the strongest house in Westeros. Quests are inspired by the main story with choices that don’t only affect stats, but relationships with other houses as well. With decisions, players usually have three choices, many only unlocked by exploring various avenues of dialogue. It was somewhat ambitious for its time and released expansions before shutting down six years later in 2019.

  When

  came out, fans were able to start playing as soon as they finished
  <em>

  Players have access to digital versions of many classic board games, from
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Uno
  </em>
  , and now they can play digital editions of newer games, from
  <em>
   Gloomhaven

  to
  <strong>
   <em>
    A Game of Thrones: The Board Game

  <em>
   House of the Dragon

  Like with the board game, gamers can play a PVP mode with up to six players or pit their wits against an AI in a single-player mode. The gameplay looks similar to games like
  <em>
   Risk

  on the surface and helps players feel like strategic geniuses, channeling their inner Varys. Players select from a range of commands, such as moving troops or defending, before revealing their choices all at once. This leads to all sorts of surprises and plot twists fans would hope from a

  <em>
   Reigns

  is a series of strategy games that takes the swiping mechanic made popular by dating apps like Tinder and uses it to create engaging games with a simple choice: yes or no. Although choices seem simple at first, they all have consequences that make the game both challenging and engaging.

  <em>
   Reigns

  applied their tried and tested formula to
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  to brilliant effect. It’s an easy game to pick up and learn to play but tricky to master its strategy. Players take the role of Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, or Sansa Stark as they sit on the Iron Throne and make decisions. Each choice the player makes must maintain a balance between military strength, religious favor, domestic popularity, and state wealth, requiring a great deal of thought with every swipe.

 <p>
  In many
  <strong>
   JRPGs
  </strong>
  , silent protagonists have become a standard, often allowing players to project themselves onto the character. This approach, common in older games, was initially shaped by hardware limitations and the need to simplify the narrative. Even without dialogues, these characters remain some of the most iconic and memorable due to their strong narrative roles and distinct personalities.

  One of the most popular JRPG franchises to have some silent protagonists got things going immediately with
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 1
  </em>
  's The Warrior of Light. Due to the hardware limitations of the time, characters had minimal interactions, resulting in protagonists with less charisma. However, The Warrior of Light was essential in establishing one of the most renowned JRPG franchises. The freedom given to players to customize different classes allowed a unique connection with the protagonist despite the initial simplicity.

 <p>
  In later appearances, such as in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  , The Warrior of Light gained more personality, interacting subtly with other characters. These additional interactions helped develop a more defined identity for the protagonist, demonstrating the evolution of silent character design within the franchise and reinforcing their importance among the best silent protagonists in JRPGs.

  Mario, Nintendo’s iconic mascot, has always been known for his minimal dialogue, primarily consisting of catchphrases. This trait continues in
  <em>
   Super Mario RPG

  . Despite being a silent protagonist in JRPGs, Mario delivers significant charisma through his actions and interactions.

 <p>
  In

His exaggerated reactions and funny mime gestures during cutscenes add a unique charm to the character, making him not just a silent avatar but a figure with a captivating personality and memorable presence, even without extensive dialogue.

  <em>
   Fire Emblem

  often varies its main characters in each game, with some opting to keep them mostly silent, such as Byleth from
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  . Despite being a character of few words, the developers succeeded in creating a charismatic protagonist with a strong presence during scenes.

  Even with limited dialogue, some of which appears through options that players can choose, Byleth remains an imposing figure, especially during pivotal moments in the story.

 <p>
  In the
  <em>
   Persona 2
  </em>
  duology, Atlus maintained the concept of silent protagonists, leading to some amusing scenarios. Maya Amano appears in both games; as a secondary character in the first, she interacts with others through dialogue, but when she becomes the protagonist in the second game, her lines disappear.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":527} -->
 <p>
  The same happens with Tetsuya Suou, who takes the opposite path, being the silent protagonist in the first game and having more dialogue in the second. However, what makes Maya Amano an excellent silent protagonist in JRPGs is her expressiveness. Atlus effectively ensured that, even without dialogue, she could express her personality through facial expressions and other actions.

 <p>
  Despite the limitations of the consoles of the time,
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  managed to deliver one of the most beautiful and enjoyable JRPGs in history, thanks to the developers' excellent work and the characters' charisma. Even though Crono is a silent protagonist throughout the game, he still manages to showcase his qualities effectively.

 <p>
  This is largely due to the excellent animations and expressions he displays during various moments in the game. Even without direct dialogue during interactions with other characters, Crono conveys his personality and emotions through these visual cues. This makes
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  one of the best JRPGs ever produced, demonstrating the genre's full potential.

  Maintaining silent protagonists is one of the great traditions of the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  franchise, one of Atlus's most popular JRPGs. However, the developer still does an excellent job of giving them personality, especially Joker, who leads
  <em>

 <p>
  Joker manages to balance being a self-insert for players enjoying his saga while maintaining his own personality. Despite being a silent protagonist, Joker is portrayed as calm and astute, with a slight inclination towards sarcasm, as demonstrated through his interactions and dialogue choices throughout the game. This balance makes Joker one of the most personable silent protagonists in JRPGs.

  From ancient civilizations to contemporary writing groups, history has graced us with an abundance of talented authors who have put forth more than a library's worth of incredible novels. Many are rich with imagery, world-building, and intriguing characters, creating whole new worlds with poetic flourish. As such, books really lend themselves to the screen, with filmmakers and game developers alike drawing on the words and bringing them to life.

  While we have seen many innocuous books be adapted into horror games — take
  <em>
   Alice: Madness Returns,
  </em>
  inspired by Lewis Caroll's
  <em>
   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
  </em>
  for example — this list explores
  <strong>
   games of various genres inspired specifically by horror literature.
  </strong>
  Some take creative license to elaborate on the original story, some are re-skinned with new interpretations, and some faithfully reproduce their written counterparts. Either way, it is well worth checking out these
  <strong>
   games based on horror books

  Based on H.P. Lovecraft's short story of the same name,

There are also upgradeable skills, stealth sections, and puzzles, offering something for all kinds of gamers.

  While the game differs from the book in terms of characters and certain story points, it maintains Max Brooks' portrayal of a world in crisis. It also makes references to language used in the book, like "zeke", and operations including the "Battle of Yonkers," which adds to the sense of lore and world-building.

  follows Gabriel Belmont of the Brotherhood of Light, who must unite heaven and earth and resurrect his wife by claiming the Lords of Darkness' power by taking their pieces of the God Mask.

  While not strictly following the storyline of Brom Stoker's
  <em>
   Dracula
  </em>
  , and unlike the other games in the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Lord of Shadows
  </em>
  hugely reinterprets the universe, acting as a prequel of sorts to Dracula's existence and taking place in its own game timeline. Along with the iconic vampire figure, the game also makes references to Le Fanu's
  <em>
   Carmilla
  </em>
  and Mary Shelley's
  <em>
   Frankenstein
  </em>
  .

    World of Horror

  is a turn-based RPG. The player, as one of 14 playable characters, must explore a pixelized world and fight cosmic horror-esque creatures to prevent the looming apocalypse.

  This game fuses Lovecraftian and Junji Ito inspirations to produce a unique esthetic and gameplay. For example, the "Cadaver Theater" is a reference to Ito's
  <em>
   House of Puppets,
  </em>
  and the name "Tomie" can be seen on one of the tombstones in the graveyard. As such,
  <em>
   World of Horror
  </em>
  is a fantastic experience for horror manga fans.

  a great nostalgic experience for any fans of the original

   <em>

  </strong>
  is a sci-fi slash psychological horror point-and-click game. It revolves around the "Mastercomputer" AM (an American supercomputer built for a global war) that has gained sentience and developed an extreme hatred for the human race. Playing alternately as the last five people on Earth, kept alive by AM to be tortured, the player must navigate tailored scenarios to redeem each character for their misdeeds.

  The game is based on the book of the same name, and largely follows the same plot up until the ending, with the author himself being involved in the project. Like the book,
  <em>
   I Have No Mouth
  </em>
  deals with extremely dark and poignant real-world topics, which will leave the player feeling uncomfortable and disturbed. Both the game and the novel offer an introspective, dystopian commentary on human flaws and artificial intelligence.

  sees the player thrust into the shoes of the narrator of Lovecraft's short story,
  <em>
   Dagon

  . In this walking simulator-style game, players can explore a nautical wasteland — discovered when drifting out to sea on a lifeboat — and the horrors that inhabit it. There are also point-and-click elements with hidden secrets to find, revealing factual information about the author's life and the story itself.

  The experience is accompanied by a word-for-word narration of
  <em>

  , which accompanies the nature of the gameplay flawlessly. The visuals of this game are also stylized and visceral; the fishy saltiness of the ocean can almost be smelled through the screen. Overall,
  <em>

  is an educational, immersive experience that embodies the original story very well.

  A

  </em>
  player has shared their amusement after they accidentally trolled their in-game husband, Harvey. This little-known detail from
  <em>

  In

  NPC, they move into their farmhouse and use it as their primary residence, typically only venturing into town a few days per week, depending on the individual.

  Once a
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  NPC is living in a player's home, they'll continue to go through a daily routine that closes out with them going to sleep for the night. However,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player and Reddit user Saraisnotsorry made a mistake while redesigning their home that impacted Pelican Town's doctor and their spouse, Harvey. The
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player put their bed into their inventory as they were moving things around, and forgot about it, eventually losing track of time with their farmer passing out at 2 am. However, upon speaking to Harvey in the morning, Saraisnotsorry realized that they hadn't put the bed back and that Harvey was pitifully looking around, wondering where he would sleep and lamenting that he had slept on the floor the prior night.

  Stardew Valley Detail Adds More Life to the Game

  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  's 1.6 update, but it's actually been around for a while, since the ability to pick up and move a farmhouse's main bed was added to the title. Other players seemed quite amused at the scene, with some noting that they had to try this with their own in-game spouses.

  It's unlikely that hiding the game's sole bed away has any negative influence on a player's relationship with their spouse. In theory, it wouldn't even necessarily have a negative impact on the player so long as they go to sleep somewhere else, like in their home on Ginger Island. However, if they want to avoid this problem, there's a couple ways to go about it. A player can simply remember to set down their bed anywhere in the house before 2 am and pick it up again in the morning if they want to keep redecorating. Alternatively, placing another bed anywhere else in the house will let the player and NPC sleep at night. With that said, this seems like a fun and harmless prank to pull on a spouse.

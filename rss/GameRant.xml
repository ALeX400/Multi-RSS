  Like all previous titles,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </strong>
  </em>
  players can choose between three classes to define their character's fighting style, as well as specializations for each class to allow players to personalize their builds further.

 <p>
  Unlike previous
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games, this is the first to combine all the skills into one interesting web that players can experiment with by deciding their own path toward the abilities, passives, and other skills they wish to use, instead of having separate skill trees. Players will gradually earn skill points through leveling and exploring in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  but those who have decided to play as a Mage may first wish to work towards these skills to give themselves a better chance at survival.

  Many players that select the class of Mage in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  may find themselves using mostly light armor that has the lowest defense out of the options available. Thankfully, there is an assortment of passive skills to be found in the skill tree that give players all sorts of resistance, with one of the most useful being resistant to physical damage that players will want to grab early.

 <p>
  Players that favor the staff will likely be keeping a distance, which means Bulwark may not be as useful. However, those that have instead been using the mage-knife and orb will enjoy passives like Bulwark due to it allowing them to take more hits during combat while up close.

 <p>
  There is an assortment of abilities for players to purchase depending on the sort of build they are planning to create for their Mage in Veilguard. While this article may not include any other abilities to allow players to experiment with their build how they see fit, especially when looking for abilities that apply status effects like Weakened, Tempest is a great option for any Mage.

 <p>
  This spell is perfect when dealing with a large group of enemies, as casting down the Tempest will electrocute everyone around the player for a small amount of time. This strike ability that lasts for a duration also has the chance to stagger enemies, which allows players to perform their epic takedown, which is fun to see even for a Mage.

 <p>
  One of the most important things a player should unlock first on the skill page for the Mage is a way to increase their total mana. This is what is used by the player to use their various abilities and, by having more available, a player is likely to be able to use more of their abilities during a battle and a lot quicker too.

 <p>
  Fade Conduit is one of many passive skills that increases the player's total mana by 50. Players may wish to look for other passives in the skill web to increase this maximum further, or possibly use different armors to boost it too.

 <p>
  As seen, the abilities in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  are categorized by different types, such as some abilities being considered blast while others are strike. There is an assortment of ability upgrades to be found within the skill page's web that increase certain types of abilities, with Pressure Point being great for those that favor strike spells.
 </p>

 <p>
  Pressure Point goes a step further than increasing damage, as using a strike ability that achieves a critical hit will give the player the effect of Quickened. This decreases the cooldown of abilities to let the player use them more often.

 <p>
  While some traits on the skill page of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  are specific to a certain weapon being used, traits like Fade Strike are not only something players will likely unlock instantly during their playthrough, but are also incredibly useful.

 <p>
  When dodging around the map using their Fade Step dodge ability, a player with the Fade Strike trait can deal a large amount of damage when they dash toward an enemy and then use a light or heavy attack. Since this can be purchased so early, it is a must for any player, no matter the build they are planning to work towards, and opens up combat to plenty more combos than just using status effects.

 <p>
  Alongside mashing the light and heavy attacks against foes, players can spice up their combat by using jump attacks. While these are available from the start of the game anyway, players can also improve them with greater passives, like Downfall, which is another skill players can unlock early into their playthrough.

 <p>
  When using a jump attack on a foe that has been knocked down by a different attack, the player will always strike with a critical hit that is sure to do far more damage. This can make dealing with foes a lot easier, especially in the early game of
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Returning to the usefulness of dodging in
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  , a Mage is far more likely to be avoiding the hits of foes by Fade stepping away instead of parrying their attacks. Fade Reflex is a perfect trait for any player that favors dodging most of all, as performing a perfect dodge will slow time while keeping the player at normal speed to allow them to fluster an enemy with a flurry of attacks.

 <p>
  Players who are struggling to hit enemies will want to work towards this trait as soon as possible to give themselves a better fighting chance in the combat of
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  . This trait also works well with many of the abilities, with it giving the player an opening.

  Alongside having the weakest defense out of all the classes in
  <em>

  , players may find themselves being hit rather excessively due to struggles to move out of the way of abilities, especially when they have only just started the game.

  There is hope, with the Essence Eater greater passive, when a player performs a Takedown on an enemy, their Rook will receive 250 health back and 20 towards their ultimate. Players who have created a stagger build will likely make the most of this passive, though it is just as useful for a regular mage too.

  Due to the upcoming integration with
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , publisher Activision has confirmed that the minimum specifications for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be updated with the start of Season 1 on November 14. Activision says that the new improvements coming later this month will require all
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  users to be on devices with either iOS 17, Android 13, or higher, with a GPU capable of bindless texturing.

 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  has already raked in plenty of money for Activision following its worldwide launch earlier this year. While the new title didn't quite bring in the same amount as
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Mobile
  </em>
  , it still reportedly saw an impressive $1.6 million in its first four days, according to data estimates via PocketGamer. While
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Mobile
  </em>
  stands as its own separate entity,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  is connected to its console counterpart,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  , and will soon share new updates with the most recent
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  release,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>

  With the launch of
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 1 on November 14, the free-to-play Battle Royale game will be fully integrated with Treyarch Studios' new entry. This means all of the player's weapons, operators, and more will be connected with
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , alongside the game's major features, like omnidirectional movement. This also means that
  <em>
   Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  will be receiving the same treatment, which Activision says will require the game's mobile specifications to be increased. "We’ve been heads down working on the latest shared features like Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1 and beyond plus exciting QOL updates," the studio said in a new post on Twitter. "With these innovative improvements and meaningful technical advancements coming to mobile, we’re going to be updating our minimum specifications."

  From November 14,
  <em>
   Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  players will need to be on either an Apple device with iOS 17 or higher, or on a mobile device operating on Android 13 or higher. Activision also says that the device will need to be capable of bindless texturing. While the studio says most devices operating on at least iOS 17 or Android 13 will likely have a GPU capable of bindless texturing, an official FAQ includes a full list of devices known to be unsupported. For players on an unsupported device, Activision says those already on version 3.10 will still be able to play until May 5, 2025, but will not receive the new Season 1 content. Version 3.10 will then become unplayable from the aforementioned date.

  The latest changes to the popular mobile

  game come less than two months after the
  <em>

  </em>
  team was hit with layoffs. Despite the massive success that the title found earlier this year, the development studio was included with the latest round of layoffs at Microsoft, which occurred on September 12. Although it's unclear how many staff members were laid off specifically from
  <em>

  , Microsoft confirmed that a total of 650 employees were being laid off across its entire gaming division.

   The
   <em>
    Life &amp; Death
   </em>
   expansion for
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  opens up a whole new experience of living life to the fullest—whether alive or beyond! This pack invites players to explore the journey of the soul, offering deep and meaningful gameplay that celebrates both joyful milestones and the reflective moments of life’s end. With features like new social events, new ghost abilities, and interactions that breathe life into the afterlife, this expansion is perfect for Simmers who want to immerse their Sims in a story that spans both worlds.

  One highly anticipated addition is the return of dedicated Cemetery lots, a feature previously enjoyed in
  <em>
   The Sims 3
  </em>
  . This addition allows players to manage urns, gravestones, and create serene spaces for remembrance and reflection. In earlier versions of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , players could only create makeshift cemeteries on residential lots, like the Goth family’s backyard memorial, or through custom mods. Now, players can build beautiful Cemetery lots where Sims can honor their loved ones, adding a touch of realism and tradition to their neighborhoods. Here’s a guide on how to create the cemetery in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .

  The
  <em>
   Life &amp; Death
  </em>
  expansion introduces Ravenwood’s hauntingly beautiful Eternal Hollow Cemetery, located in the Crow's Crossing neighborhood. This thoughtfully pre-built cemetery offers Sims a peaceful resting place, and players can freely redecorate it to suit their tastes or make additional personal touches. With the new "Cemetery" lot type added to community lots, players can now design cemeteries in any world of their choice. Whether they want to create an expansive memorial garden or an intimate graveyard, the lot type gives them the freedom to make these spaces meaningful and unique.

 <p>
  To create a functioning cemetery, players will need to place a few required items, which are necessary to complete the lot’s functionality. There are also certain optional requirements to increase the lot's utility further. Here are all the required and optional items for creating a cemetery in

 <p>
  It’s worth noting that there’s no strict size requirement for a Cemetery lot in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , allowing players flexibility in their designs. However, creating a cemetery that accommodates a substantial number of departed Sims while maintaining functionality may require a decent amount of space. This is especially true if players want to incorporate both gravesites and crypts, as these items can take up significant room—particularly when building without the
  <em>
   MoveObjects On
  </em>
  cheat.

  While players should just let their creativity run wild, here are some tips that can help build a functional cemetery:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Using MoveObjects Cheat with Pathing in Mind:
   </strong>
   While it might be tempting to stack gravesites close together for a compact layout, Sims need a fair amount of space around gravesites to interact with them effectively. If you’re planning on using the
   <em>
    MoveObjects
   </em>
   cheat to position gravesites closely, be sure to test the layout to ensure that each gravesite remains accessible. This way, Sims can navigate smoothly around the cemetery without issues.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Designing a Dual-Function Memorial Venue:
   </strong>
   With the addition of Funeral events, consider adding items that double as memorial elements and functional objects for the event. Essentials might include a table for eulogies, seating areas, and any other items that fit a funeral setting. Also, think about more versatile objects like musical instruments, buffet tables, or small planters where Sims can interact during the event, as these activities can also be performed during a funeral event.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Incorporating Decor to Influence Moodlets:
   </strong>
   Many Sims will experience negative moodlets when visiting a cemetery or funeral, especially if they’re grieving. Adding items that provide positive or comforting moodlets, such as flowers, benches to make a well-decorated space, or decor that can give certain moodlets, can make a big difference. Not only does this can improve the overall experience, but it also adds unique detail, making the lot feel more complete and thoughtfully designed.

      <title>The Switch 2 Could Be Teed Up to Make Good On One Highly-Requested Zelda Release</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/switch-2-potential-wind-waker-twilight-princess-hd-zelda-release/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The existence of the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  is arguably one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry, with only official confirmation from Nintendo and a reveal of the new hardware standing between players and the Switch's successor. One of the larger questions surrounding the console, other than a projected release date and hardware specifications, is which Nintendo first-party franchises will launch alongside the Switch 2, and there's an obvious contender in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  . Aside from the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise being a time-tested console seller for Nintendo hardware at launch, the company still needs to make good on Switch ports of
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  , two of the series' most beloved entries.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  were released in 2002 and 2006, respectively, and have each received HD remasters on the Wii U despite never coming to the Nintendo Switch. Both titles' absence on Nintendo's hybrid console is curious given that nearly every other game in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series (save for the DS-exclusive handheld entries) has made its way to the hardware either as a standalone retail release or a classic game available through Nintendo Switch Online. Delivering two well-known series entries along with the launch of the Switch 2 seems like a likely way to bring the entire series under one roof and cater to fans who've been requesting the remasters on modern hardware.

  Recently confirmed by Nintendo, the Switch 2 will feature backward compatibility, meaning players will still have access to their physical and digital game collections after upgrading to Nintendo's next hardware iteration. Considering that the Switch is home to the largest single library of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, Nintendo has an opportunity to do something monumental that would only be possible through backward compatibility. Launching a Switch successor that features backward compatibility would bring most of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  library over on day 1, and Nintendo could sweeten the deal by launching the system with ports of
  <em>
   The Wind Waker HD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Twilight Princess HD
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Together with the rest of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games already available on the Switch (including the most retail
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game releases of any generation of Nintendo hardware), having almost the entire
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series playable on the Switch 2 at launch would be a major selling point for players looking to upgrade. As a silver lining, Nintendo's handling of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise could serve as a positive example for other developers to follow concerning game preservation.

 <p>
  The recent announcement of
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  's remaster and release on the Switch leaves very few Wii U-exclusive titles remaining, with many of the console's games having already made their way over to Nintendo's current hardware. Looking at the sales data for the Switch versus the Wii U, there's a massive gap that exists between Nintendo's best-selling home console and one of its few commercial failures, so it makes sense that Nintendo would want to bring several Wii U games over to better-selling hardware as a way to recoup on its investment. Why the HD
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  remasters for the Wii U have yet to follow suit is anyone's guess, but there's arguably never been a better time to bring them over than now.
 </p>

 <p>
  Nintendo will likely aim for a 2025 release date for the Switch 2, and with backward compatibility now a confirmed feature, players will have at least three generations of Nintendo titles under one umbrella. The freeing of
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  from Wii U exclusivity is something that few players thought would ever happen. Now that it has,
  <em>
   The Wind Waker HD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Twilight Princess HD
  </em>
  are the next likely candidates to receive the same treatment.

It should also be added that the developers may deactivate the codes that are currently available, and they will no longer be able to provide rewards.

  Although it is usually an easy and simple task that does not require many steps, it is still essential to know exactly how to do it. Therefore, for gamers who still do not know how to redeem codes in
  <em>
   Elemental Dungeons
  </em>
  , there is a detailed guide below:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":492} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   First, players need to launch
   <em>
    Elemental Dungeons
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   After loading, fans will find a large blue Codes button in the game menu in the middle of the screen, and they should press it.
  </li>
  <li>
   A menu will appear, and gamers should press another Codes button on the top right.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, players should scroll up and copy one of the codes provided above and paste it into the 'Type Code Here' field. Of course, the code can be entered using the keyboard, but copying is an easier option. Just make sure not to copy the code with a space accidentally.
  </li>
  <li>
   And finally, to redeem the code and get a valuable game reward, players should press Redeem.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1121} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The reward will be automatically added, but keep in mind that each code can be used only once per account and only while it is active.

  Whenever you start an operation in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Freedom Wars Remastered
   </strong>
  </em>
  , you'll get to choose which comrades you bring with you. While main story operations will require you to take specific comrades sometimes, you'll still usually have some level of freedom when making your team.

  Just the player, your comrades can get stronger and can be upgraded to make them more efficient in combat. Comrades are great for distracting the enemy and dealing additional damage, and always having them going down can lead to much longer fights against Abductors; here's how to make your comrades stronger by leveling them up.

 <p>
  While there is a lot more flexibility in how you choose to level up your character and their accessory, comrades are simply upgraded by increasing their level.
  <strong>
   Increasing their level will give them better gear,
  </strong>
  generally increasing their overall stats, and each level will lead to a noticeable increase in their effectiveness in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  To upgrade their level you'll need to go to the Claim Entitlements menu in the Window on Liberty and go down to the
  <strong>
   Equipment Entitlements section
  </strong>
  . In this section, most of the tabs will be the leveled gear permits for each of your potential comrades throughout the game. You can choose to upgrade only those you want to use often, but just know there will be the occasional limitations or a comrade being unavailable for a short time due to story reasons, but this isn't very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrading their Gear Level will overall make them more effective in combat, and they won't go down as easily. This can make clearing operations quickly much easier to try and lower your prison sentence.

  While you'll usually be able to choose whoever you want for operations, there are some story-related operations where you'll be forced to use specific characters. Those two main characters are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mattias
   </strong>
   - Healing Thorn
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Beatrice
   </strong>
   - Healing Thorn
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While they are both healers, it's a very useful Thorn that will help keep you from dying too often. While the
  <strong>
   story missions where you're forced to use these two are very limited
  </strong>
  , they can then be used in all optional Operations, so they are the best investment if you're trying to limit the amount of Entitlement Points you're trying to spend to save them for more useful upgrades.

  Some Western RPGs know that their players love to stop and smell the roses from the time. As a result, these games are crafted to reward players who take their time to explore a detailed game world instead of blazing their path to the end credits.

  When players are unceremoniously dropped into the world of

   <em>

  </strong>
  , it's easy to feel frustrated, as they won't be able to handle a single enemy without biting the dust. This is intentional, with players having to put in the work and head to a camp before they can obtain the skills needed to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over time, players will realize just how valuable the rewards are for becoming more competent at the game. The world becomes easier to explore and rewards players for uncovering every nook and cranny, especially near the endgame when valuable equipment can be acquired to take out enemies with ease.

 <p>
  Players who take their time to scour the world will find a ton of rewards to help them become ridiculously strong in no time. However, they shouldn't ignore the main quest for too long, since it may make it harder to follow what's happening after a point if the story is left at a standstill for hours.

  With the game's strong role-playing elements, some of the unique content players can find here is quite rewarding. From monster dens to unique quests, it's all quite entertaining. It's easy to see why players love what

  An immersive sim action RPG that has become legendary for all the right reasons, it's easy to see why slow exploration is so rewarding in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Ammo, medkits, augmentation canisters, and credits are just a few of the many valuable things players can find if they take the time to explore the game's meticulously crafted levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's easy to be distracted by every nook and cranny in
  <em>
   Deus Ex's

  larger levels, while the smaller stages still give players numerous options to make progress and reach their goals. While some of these avenues are blocked off based on Denton's chosen skills, the vast majority of paths are open to the player and full of unique content.

  It’s easy for newer
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valorant
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  players to feel intimidated when the likes of Iso threaten the meta with a moving impenetrable wall, a Vulnerable projectile, and even an Ultimate that forces a one-on-one duel. However, newcomers to the acclaimed FPS don’t necessarily need to dash into a fight with the new Duelist recklessly, especially if they start learning how to use the game’s more accessible Agents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning how to use their abilities properly can help players rise through the ranks, eventually mastering key gameplay styles that will eventually aid them in using more specialized Agents such as controlled flashes with Skye, more aggressive bombing with Raze, and map mastery with Omen. Among
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  ’s easiest Agents to learn include the game’s resident firestarter, an acclaimed engineer, an infamous archer, and even a popular lurker.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  <em>
   The more Valorant grows, the harder it becomes for new players to enter the game and enjoy it. The abundance of unique Agents in Valorant makes new players wonder what their character is capable of and what the opponents can do to counter them.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's make it straight in the beginning that every Agent in Valorant requires time and effort to master, however, some Agents have no barriers at the entry-level, while some others like Jett or Raze are quite difficult to start with, putting the player under pressure from the teammates.

  Despite recent buffs to this Duelist, the aim-heavy kit of
  <strong>
   Iso
  </strong>
  makes his attack-heavy
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  gameplay ideal for players who want to focus on gunplay instead of abilities. The infamous
  <strong>
   Double Tap (Signature)
  </strong>
  grants a shield that absorbs any one attack, and the shield can be refreshed if Iso shoots the energy orb that spawns from the enemy killed while in this state. Earning the moniker “Aimlabs,” this “shoot the random orb” requirement to fully take advantage of Double Tap will train Iso users to shoot accurately and while under distress.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest of Iso’s kit is tailored towards giving him and his allies an easier time entering the Site for frags. Thanks to
  <strong>
   Undercut (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  , Iso can grant Vulnerable to everyone hit by his orbs, making its 4-second window a vital timeframe for fast kills. Meanwhile, his
  <strong>
   Contingency (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  is an indestructible wall with a small angle that he and his allies can hug for surprise attacks, or can be used to bait enemies. Lastly,
  <strong>
   Kill Contract (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  pits Iso and a target in a duel to the death. This Ultimate should be used carefully, however, as it can be dodged by jumping or releasing a Yoru clone. Likewise, enemies can simply sneak up to Iso’s location to kill him as soon as he returns - although allies can do this to the enemy’s location as well.

  Poisoner
  <strong>
   Viper
  </strong>
  might be everyone's next-door crush in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  , but her kit is one of the trickiest to use in the game. As a Sentinel, Viper is a potent defender, and can even execute interesting strategies if her kit is utilized properly. She's known for her
  <strong>
   Toxic Screen (Signature)
  </strong>
  , a wall-penetrating poison wall that damages enemies upon passing, making it a nifty cover for sites and may even be used as a fake setup to trap lurkers. Meanwhile, her
  <strong>
   Poison Cloud (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  is a persistent molly that can provide effective cover for retakes, isolate the Spike, or damage aggressors. Lastly,
  <strong>
   Snake Bite (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  is a decent AOE that punishes opponents for trying to get to her territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Viper's Pit (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  is considered one of the game's best Ultimates for its defensive capability, as not only does it mask the Spike in a cloud that Nearsights enemies, but all of them are Decayed while inside - making them easy pickings as long as Viper manages to spot them first. While Viper's reusable abilities allow her to reuse defensible angles, she suffers the same fate as Killjoy as being rather useless if her skills don't proc assists throughout the round. Moreover, whereas Killjoy has re-deployable abilities, Viper's are permanently placed throughout the round.

  's resident trapper
  <strong>
   Cypher
  </strong>
  is the cause of a lot of the game's woes - especially for players who know how to use his traps effectively. However, regardless of how sleek the Agent feels after killing enemies who cross his traps, mastering their placement is more elaborate than it looks. Key to his setups are
  <strong>
   Trapwires (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  that annoyingly Tether, Reveal, and Concuss opponents that step on them. While it's true that enemies can just avoid Cypher's favored sites upon sensing the Trapwires, they are extremely effective deterrents for a weaker Site to force enemies to attack a better-defended location. Meanwhile,
  <strong>
   Cyber Cage (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  creates a digital wall that can act as smoke, giving Cypher nifty opportunities to initiate one-way walls to attack unsuspecting Trapwire victims. Moreover,
  <strong>
   Spycam (Signature)
  </strong>
  allows him to spot enemies and tag them for his allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  To add salt to the wounds of his enemies, Cypher can trigger
  <strong>
   Neural Theft (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  to spot enemy locations in the map for his allies to see - allowing them to chase down enemies who try to retake or even launch a surprise attack. Despite his traps being re-deployable, Cypher's biggest disadvantage lies in constantly thinking of lineups so enemies can't spot where his traps are located. Not only that, his Spycam won't have much utility if enemies spot where it is quickly. Enemies who don't go to Cypher's site can render most of his traps useless unless players can quickly set up a Plan B for the retake.

  <strong>
   Omen
  </strong>
  is also the resident representative of Controllers in the game. Of the FPS title’s combat roles, Omen secures control over the battlefield by setting smokes in any part of the map, giving his team breathing room to prepare for insertion. Key parts of his kit are his
  <strong>
   Dark Cover (Signature)
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  which opens a 3D version of the map and allows him to set up large globules of smoke. In the hands of a trained player, Omen can set these smokes to float just a few feet off the ground, giving him full view of the feet of opponents trying to sneak inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest of his kit incentivizes ratty plays from users who become more familiar with the map. His
  <strong>
   Paranoia (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  lets him release a smoke wave that blinds anyone he hits, while
  <strong>
   Shrouded Step
  </strong>
  lets him teleport to a specific location he can see - both of which allow him to outmaneuver foes even in sketchy situations. Lastly, his
  <strong>
   From The Shadows (Ultimate)

  Newcomer
  <strong>
   Clove
  </strong>
  is praised for making Controller plays more fun with their
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  mechanics, practically making them a more aggressive Omen or a tactical Reyna. Players who want to train their smoke plays can use
  <strong>
   Ruse (Signature)
  </strong>
  to release up to two smoke clouds via a Brimstone-style tactical map. Clove can even extend their utility after death, as Ruse allows them to release smoke clouds within their body’s vicinity - potentially aiding in post-Plant retakes and defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  In combat, Clove can rely on
  <strong>
   Meddle (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  to Decay enemies with a bursting orb, paving the way for faster kills. This works perfectly with their
  <strong>
   Pick-Me-Up (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  gives them a 100 HP Overheal and a much-needed speed boost for faster next kills. Upon death,
  <strong>
   Not Dead Yet (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  lets them get a temporary 12-second revive that becomes permanent if they assist or kill someone. The aggro-oriented kit of Clove can make them a perfect training ground for more serious smoke plays or tactical gunfights, allowing newcomers to get used to both Controllers and Duelists at once.

  Walling remains one of the most essential skills of a
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  Agent and is something that
  <strong>
   Harbor
  </strong>
  can teach with his wave-heavy kit. At its core, walls can block enemy sight from entries (and fake entries), allowing Harbor and his teammates to secure sites for entry and defense in a myriad of ways. Key to his arsenal is his
  <strong>
   High Tide (Signature)
  </strong>
  , perhaps the most flexible wall in the game for its ability to both curve and adjust based on elevation. With the right aim, Harbor can have High Tide block either “hell” or a “heaven” in a location with vertical spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Harbor can also rely on a “smaller” wall via
  <strong>
   Cascade (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  which moves in front of him and can be stopped at will, perfect for pushes and fake pushes. He can throw an orb with
  <strong>
   Cove (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  that surrounds an area in a temporarily bullet-proof dome, perfect for protecting planting and defusing allies, as well as becoming a pseudo-smoke. Lastly, his
  <strong>
   Reckoning (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  envelops an area with water that triggers a concussion in areas enemies are standing on, making it unadvisable for them to remain in the area.

  Thanks to
  <strong>
   Gekko
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  gameplay bridges the gap between FPS and
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games with his “buddies.” Gekko’s creatures become
  <strong>
   Globules (Passive)
  </strong>
  after usage, with the Agent capable of reclaiming them and using them another time after a short cooldown. The “rechargeable” nature of most of Gekko’s kit can be explained by their straightforward abilities, such as floating
  <strong>
   Dizzy (Signature)
  </strong>
  that temporarily Blinds enemies that look at it with plasma blasts or
  <strong>
   Mosh Pit (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  that releases a toxic surface that deals damage over time before exploding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where Gekko shines as an Initiator is
  <strong>
   Wingman (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  , who can alternate between Concussing the first enemy he sees and planting or defusing the Spike. Gekko’s area control is improved even further with
  <strong>
   Thrash (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  which releases a beast he controls that can stun all players (ally or enemy) in an area. Gekko’s nature as an Initiator-Sentinel hybrid makes him a worthwhile Agent to learn for newcomers who want to explore Agents that accommodate multiple roles.

  Tejo is the latest Agent to join
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  and he has easy-to-use abilities. Both the
  <strong>
   Signature
  </strong>
  and the
  <strong>
   Ultimate
  </strong>
  abilities of Tejo use a targeting system on the map, which makes them quite easy to benefit from for every player that knows the map, the camping points, and the default plant spots.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand,
  <strong>
   Special Delivery (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  might need a little bit of practice for newcomers, as it is important to have perfect timing for throwing the grenade and peeking concussed enemies.
  <strong>
   Stealth Drone (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  also needs to be used when Tejo is in a safe spot, as the player will not have access to their weapons or movement while driving the drone.

  Despite the current low pick rate of Agent
  <strong>
   Deadlock
  </strong>
  among pro players, the Sentinel’s kit balances Sage’s area denial and Killjoy’s gadget utility. A key aspect of Deadlock’s skillset is her
  <strong>
   Barrier Mesh (Signature)
  </strong>
  , which creates a heavily fortified cross-shaped barrier that can fit most corners and let bullets (but not people) pass through.
 </p>
 <p>
  Working in tandem with this wall is her suite of detection skills, with
  <strong>
   Sonic Sensor (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  activating a concussive AOE when enemies near it make sounds, while
  <strong>
   GravNet (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  detonates into an AOE that forces enemies to crouch-walk slowly. Lastly, her
  <strong>
   Annihilation (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  wraps an opponent it catches, insta-killing them should they reach the Ult’s origin point unless enemies destroy the cocoon.

  Fans of tool-heavy
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  games get the closest approximation to a special forces soldier with
  <strong>
   Brimstone
  </strong>
  , leader of the Valorant Protocol. As the first Controller players have access to, Brimstone’s kit trains players in some of the most fundamental aspects of
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  gameplay: angling mollies, smoke-based map control, and timing ally buffs. Brimstone being a Controller in particular emphasizes team guidance through
  <strong>
   Sky Smoke (Signature)
  </strong>
  , arguably the most accessible mini-map smoking mechanic among members of the Role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Brimstone can also aid pre-entry with
  <strong>
   Stim Beacon (Basic 2)
  </strong>
  that boosts teammates’ speed (movement, equip, reload, recovery) and fire rate, which can prove crucial in encounters. The Controller can also deal AOE in tight spots with his ricocheting
  <strong>
   Incendiary (Basic 1)
  </strong>
  , or assume full control over an area with a large-scale
  <strong>
   Orbital Strike (Ultimate)
  </strong>
  that guarantees death to enemies who stay in its radius.

  has now been released, and with it has come a slew of revised rules, classes, and races to bring a fresh new face to the classic system fans know and love. There haven't been too many radical changes, so that those who know 5e inside and out will still feel right at home, but the tweaks to the classes demand a refresher course.
 </p>
 <p>
  This, of course, includes the
  <strong>
   warlock
  </strong>
  class, one of the most popular choices among players. This class allows players to form a pact with a dark patron, imbuing themselves with forbidden power to give them an edge in combat. The patrons can vary wildly, giving warlocks unique flavors from one another.

   </strong>
   2025 is now upon us, as is the revised handbook for Dungeons and Dragons, bringing various tweaks and changes to races, spells, rules, and classes beloved by the fans. With this new year, many players are going to be gearing up for their next big adventure, and with it, will need to carefully consider what class to play. This article breaks down which warlock patron among all ones printed in official books, showing the revised versions of those patrons from the handbook. Now warlock players can see which patron is the best fit for their character.

   Creatures within 5 feet of the space the Warlock left or the space they appear in must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against their spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Beguiling Defenses
   </strong>
   - Gain immunity to the Charmed condition. In addition, immediately after a creature in view lands an attack, the Warlock takes a Reaction to reduce the damage by half (round down) and can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage they dealt.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Bewitching Magic
   </strong>
   - The patron grants the ability to weave magic with teleportation. Immediately after casting an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, the caster can cast Misty Step as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Gone in the blink of an eye, these
  <strong>
   Archfey Warlocks
  </strong>
  haven't gained speed to rival Sonic the Hedgehog—instead, they have been granted magic revolving around teleportation by their patron. While this does reduce the versatility this subclass has, it can be a DM's worst nightmare as the Warlock keeps removing themselves out of harm's way, and maybe even deal some damage as a goodbye gift, just like a trickster fae creature would.

  Undying Subclass Features
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 1: Among the Dead
   </strong>
   - Starting at 1st level, learn the spare the dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip. The Warlock also has advantage on saving throws against any disease. Additionally, undead have difficulty harming them. If an undead targets the player directly, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against (an undead needn't make the save when it includes the player in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if targeted.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Defy Death
   </strong>
   - The Warlock regains hit points equal to 1d8 + their Constitution modifier when they succeed on a death saving throw or when they stabilize a creature with spare the dying.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Undying Nature
   </strong>
   - Beginning at level 10, the Warlock can hold your breath indefinitely, and they don't require food, water, or sleep, although they still require rest to reduce exhaustion and benefit from short and long rests. In addition, they age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, their body ages only 1 year, and they are immune to being magically aged.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Indestructible Life
   </strong>
   - On their turn, the Warlock can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + their warlock level. Additionally, if they put a severed body part of theirs back in place when using this feature, the part attaches.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Not to be confused with the Undead patron, the
  <strong>
   Undying
  </strong>
  is all about life and death, granting the Warlock a modicum of healing abilities, as well as a spare dying cantrip. Some of their features verge on the weaker side of things, and mostly just seem there for flavor more than practical use. Still, this could make this subclass a popular pick for those who favor flavoring, backstories, and RP over combat.

    Level 3: Awakened Mind
   </strong>
   - As a Bonus Action, choose one creature within 30 feet. The caster and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two are within a number of miles of each other, equal to the Warlock's Charisma modifier. Both must mentally use a language the other knows. The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to the Warlock's level.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 3: Psychic Spells
   </strong>
   - When casting a Warlock spell that deals damage, the Warlock can change its damage type to Psychic. In addition, Enchantment or Illusion Warlock spells can be cast without Verbal or Somatic components.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant
   </strong>
   - When forming a telepathic bond with a creature using Awakened Mind, the Warlock can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against the Warlock, who has Advantage on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Eldritch Hex
   </strong>
   - The Warlock always has the Hex spell prepared. When casting Hex and choosing an ability, the target also has Disadvantage on saving throws of the chosen ability for the duration of the spell.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10 Thought Shield
   </strong>
   - The Warlock's thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless allowed. The Warlock also has Resistance to Psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals Psychic damage to them, that creature takes the same amount of damage.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Create Thrall
   </strong>
   - Summon Aberration doesn't require Concentration if desired, and instead its duration becomes 1 minute, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Warlock's level plus their Charisma modifier. In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of Hex, the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Great Old One
  </strong>
  might be the subclass with the most meat on its bones, and that doesn't just mean the Cthulhu-like entity that grants this pact. Level 3 and Level 10 each have additional subclass features, so the Warlock gains even more bang for their buck. The telepathic abilities may just seem like utility, but they gain use in combat at later levels, so Warlocks with this patron could easily snowball in higher-level campaigns.

  Fathomless Subclass Features
 </h3>
 <ul>

   <strong>
    Level 1: Tentacle of the Deeps
   </strong>
   - As a bonus action, the Warlock creates a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point they can see within 60 feet. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute. When creating the tentacle, they can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the player's next turn. At 10th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d8. As a bonus action, they can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Oceanic Soul
   </strong>
   - The Warlock gains resistance to cold damage. In addition, when fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged can understand their speech.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Guardian Coil
   </strong>
   - When the Warlock or a creature they can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the Tentacle of the Deeps, the player can use their reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage by 1d8. When they reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced by the tentacle increases to 2d8.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Grasping Tentacles
   </strong>
   - The Warlock learns Evard's black tentacles. It counts as a warlock spell, but it doesn't count against the number of spells. They can also cast it once without a spell slot once per long rest. Whenever they cast this spell, the caster gains a number of temporary hit points equal to their warlock level. Moreover, damage can't break their concentration on this spell.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Fathomless Plunge
   </strong>
   - As an action, the Warlock can teleport themselves and up to five other willing creatures within 30 feet. Amid a whirl of tentacles, they all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water the caster has seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As a
  <strong>
   Warlock of the Fathomless
  </strong>
  variety, they will gain affinity with the water, gaining powers such as the ability to summon Kraken-like tentacles, and also have the handy ability to transport themselves and their buddies out of harm's way. With a good balance of damage resistance and dealing, the Fathomless is an all-around solid choice for Warlocks who don't know if they want to harm or help.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
   </strong>
   - Once per turn when hitting a creature with an attack roll, the Warlock can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn't a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of the Warlock's next turn when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As one might expect when forging a pact with something of a more infernal persuasion, Warlocks gain fiery benefits and a few other tricks up their sleeve when choosing a
  <strong>
   Fiend
  </strong>
  as their patron. A bit more of a mixed bag than certain other subclasses, there is more that players can do with this subclass, and as such it might make it a better pick simply on the basis of adaptability. Though it may be cliche on paper, creative players can still flavor this class for more unique gameplay and interactions.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Celestial Resilience
   </strong>
   - Gain Temporary Hit Points whenever using the Magical Cunning feature or finishing a Short or Long Rest. These Temporary Hit Points equal the Warlock level plus the Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures in sight when gaining these points. Those creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half the Warlock's level plus their Charisma modifier.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Searing Vengeance
   </strong>
   - When the Warlock or an ally within 60 feet range is about to make a Death Saving Throw, unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature regains Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum and can end the Prone condition on itself. Each creature of choice within 30 feet of the creature takes Radiant damage equal to 2d8 plus Charisma modifier, and each has the Blinded condition until the end of the current turn. This feature can be used once per Long Rest.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Most players will know Warlocks as more of a DPS class, famous for their staple cantrip Eldritch Blast. But when the part is missing someone of a more holy persuasion, or needs a healer, players can opt to skip playing Cleric or Paladin, and instead use this original take on a class known for its darker and devious casters. As most of the
  <strong>
   Celestial
  </strong>
  patron's kit revolves around staving off death, players shouldn't expect to deal out hefty damage when selecting this patron.

  Genie Subclass Features
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 1: Genie's Vessel
   </strong>
   - The patron gifts the Warlock a magical vessel. The vessel is a Tiny object, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus. The player decides what the object is. While touching the vessel, the Warlock gains access to:
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Bottled Respite -
   </strong>
   As an action, magically vanish and enter the vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, the Warlock can hear the area around your vessel. They can remain inside the vessel for up to a number of hours equal to twice their proficiency bonus. They exit the vessel early if they use a bonus action to leave, if they die, or if the vessel is destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Genie's Wrath -
   </strong>
   Once during each of their turns when they hit with an attack roll, they can deal extra damage to the target equal to their proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by the Warlock's patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid)
  </li>
 </ol>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Elemental Gift
   </strong>
   - The Genie bestows resistance to a damage type determined by their kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). In addition, as a bonus action, the Warlock gains a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Sanctuary Vessel
   </strong>
   - When the Warlock enters Genie's Vessel, they can choose up to five willing creatures within 30 feet, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel. As a bonus action, any number of creatures can be ejected from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if the Warlock leaves or dies, or if the vessel is destroyed. In addition, anyone who remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a short rest there.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Limited Wish
   </strong>
   - Use an action to speak their desire into the Genie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. The spell can be from any class's spell list, and the requirements of that spell do not need to be met, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Included in the supplementary book
  <em>
   Tasha's Cauldron of Everything,
  </em>
  the
  <strong>
   Genie
  </strong>
  is a new and exciting take on the Warlock class with a wholly creative patron—the wish-granting Genie. Rather than just getting three wishes, the Warlock instead gains access to more spells and other effects determined by the element of their chosen patron. Plenty of versatility, and a handy vessel to escape within, the Genie is a strong subclass.

 <ul>
  <li>

    Level 1: Form of Dread
   </strong>
   - As a bonus action, transform for 1 minute and gain the following benefits while transformed:
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>
   You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Warlock level.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once during each of your turns, on a successful attack roll, force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of the Warlock until the end of their next turn.
  </li>
  <li>
   Become immune to the frightened condition.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Grave Touched
   </strong>
   - The Warlock no longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe. In addition, once each turns, when the player hits a creature with an attack roll and roll damage against it, they can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using Form of Dread, roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Necrotic Husk
   </strong>
   - The Warlock gains resistance to necrotic damage. If transformed using Form of Dread, they instead become immune. In addition, when the Warlock would be reduced to 0 hit points, they can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause their body to erupt. Each creature of choice that is within 30 feet takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + warlock level. They then gain 1 level of exhaustion.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Spirit Projection
   </strong>
   - As an action, the Warlock can project their spirit from their body. The body left behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation. Any damage or other effects that apply to the spirit or physical body affect the other. The spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until concentration is broken. When the projection ends, the spirit and body reunite. While spirit projecting, gain the following benefits:
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
  </li>
  <li>
   When casting a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.
  </li>
  <li>
   Gain a flying speed equal to the body's walking speed. The spirit can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but deal1d10 force damage if the spirit ends its turn inside a creature or object.
  </li>
  <li>
   While using Form of Dread, once during each turn, when the spirit deals necrotic damage to a creature, in turn, regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Introduced in
  <em>
   Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft
  </em>
  , Warlocks can now channel the
  <strong>
   undead
  </strong>
  powers of creatures such as vampires and demiliches, in turn taking on a twisted vision of their visage that can frighten and bolster health. The highest level feature is one that is unique and could see a lot of fun play in-game, whether scouting or in the midst of combat.

  Hexblade Subclass Features
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 1: Hexblade's Curse
   </strong>
   - As a bonus action, the Warlock can choose one creature within 30 feet. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, the caster dies or is incapacitated. Until the curse ends, the Warlock gains the following benefits:
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li>
   A bonus equal their proficiency bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any attack roll they make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
  </li>
  <li>
   If the cursed target dies, the Warlock regains hit points equal to their warlock level + Charisma modifier.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 1: Hexblade Warrior
   </strong>
   - Gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. Whenever the player finishes a long rest, they can touch one weapon they are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When they attack with that weapon, they can use their Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 6: Accursed Specter
   </strong>
   - When the Warlock slays a humanoid, they can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half the Warlock's level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 10: Armor of Hexes
   </strong>
   - If the target cursed by Hexblade's Curse hits the Warlock with an attack roll, they can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses, regardless of its roll.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 14: Master of Hexes
   </strong>
   - When the creature cursed by Hexblade's Curse dies, the caster can apply the curse to a different creature within 30 feet. When they apply the curse in this way, they don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The age-old question when starting a
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  campaign—martial class or caster? It can be a tough question to answer, especially if the party is already balanced and there are no roles that need to be filled. Well, with the
  <strong>
   Hexblade
  </strong>
  patron, players no longer need to agonize over this choice. Instead, they can simply pick this subclass and enjoy the best of both worlds. The perfect balance between the two modes of play makes the Hexblade the best current patron in
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  , even with
  <em>
   One D&amp;D
  </em>
  now on the market.

  Although the Harry Potter franchise has seen numerous games, none reach the level of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , which allows players to experience an original story within the same universe as the books. Even as an excellent Cozy RPG, the game still offers some more relaxed moments for those who just want to unwind, enjoy the scenery, or engage in side content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combat might be an issue for those who dislike it, but it features configurable difficulty that can make it less tiring and time-consuming, leaving more time to explore the incredible landscapes that
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  offers. Additionally, players can build their own Vivarium and fill it with magical creatures, one of the most enjoyable optional activities in the game.

   Potion Permit
  </em>
  offers an interesting take on the genre, as in this open-ended Cozy RPG, the main objective for players is to diagnose the illnesses that the villagers have and prepare potions to cure them. Set in the village of Moonbury, the game allows exploration of a vibrant world, collection of ingredients from nature, and facing monsters in dynamic battles to obtain rare materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to treating the villagers, players interact with a diverse community of NPCs, developing relationships that affect the story's progress. Mini-games representing potion-making and diagnostics make the gameplay engaging, while house customization and village improvements add plenty of content for players who enjoy personalization, balancing the gameplay for cozy game enthusiasts.

  One of the most popular farm simulators of all time,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , excels because the game manages to balance elements common in cozy games with a touch of fantasy. While players explore Pelican Town, areas typical of a rural town blend with magical and unique elements, such as a wizard's tower or an adventurers' guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, the game offers an experience that transcends the everyday routine of a traditional farm simulator, presenting fantastical elements without overwhelming players with this setting. Although this approach isn't exclusive to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , it remains one of the farm simulators that best balance these elements both in gameplay and setting.

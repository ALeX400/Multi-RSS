  As part of his journey in
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , Shadow gains access to new powers derived from the DNA he shares with Black Doom. Wielding the shapeshifting abilities of the Black Arms, Shadow is able to amplify his existing strengths and explore his stages in entirely new ways.

  The first new trick Shadow learns, Doom Spears allow Shadow to lock-on to up to 5 targets at a time before firing homing Chaos Spears at all of them. This can activate multiple switches simultaneously, and stun groups of enemies with a single input. These are most useful when facing enemies that are harmful to hit with a Homing Attack since they'll become vulnerable when stunned.

 <p>
  After clearing both Acts of Rail Canyon and climbing up to the top of a nearby structure to use the Doom Gear, Shadow will gain the Doom Blast. This allows him to launch certain enemies skyward by holding down the Homing Attack button. Shadow can then aim them and press the Homing Attack button again to launch them in a direction. Shadow can then teleport to their destination, smashing them downward in the process.

 <p>
  This can be used to smash the target through lines of other enemies like a cannonball and to reach areas higher up and further away that would otherwise be impossible to reach by taking advantage of Shadow's follow-up teleport. This ability can only be used on Black Arms enemies, so when you see one, it's practically a big neon sign saying "Use Chaos Blast to find a secret path."

  Doom Surf is unlocked after taking down the Biolizard and using the Doom Gear you got from doing so. Doom Surf automatically activates when Shadow touches water, creating a Black Arms Manta Ray to ride across the water's surface. Hitting the boost button allows Shadow to shoot forward and accelerate to top speed, while the left and right bumpers allow him to perform a spin that can damage enemies and objects.

 <p>
  Doom Surf can be a little hard to steer until you get used to using the spin to reposition when at high speed, but once you've got the hang of it you can take out enemies and avoid obstacles with tremendous speed.

 <p>
  Shadow's most drastic transformation yet, Doom Morph is unlocked after using the Doom Gear received by beating Metal Overlord. By using a homing attack on a Morph Ball (purple orbs that can be found floating throughout the hub world and certain levels) Shadow will transform into a squid-like monstrosity that can glide through sludge at high speeds and use its tentacles to grapple from Morph Orbs. Shadow can use the boost button in this form to dash forward at high speed and damage enemies.

 <p>
  After transforming, tapping the Homing Attack button will have Shadow latch onto a Morph Ball and reel himself into it, while holding the Homing Attack button will have him latch on and swing from it in an arc. By using both of these as appropriate, Shadow can build up some incredible momentum and launch himself high into the air or over long distances.

  Shadow's final Doom Power, Doom Wing, is also the first power you get to use (during a scripted section of Space Colony Ark on your first visit.) Doom Wing can be activated by pressing both bumpers while Shadow has 50 Rings or more. Shadow will sprout wings, allowing him to glide through the air at high speed by holding the boost button. While gliding, Shadow won't lose altitude, and he can remain gliding for as long as he has Boost Gauge remaining.

  Doom Wing also renders Shadow functionally invincible while active, excluding falls into bottomless pits, allowing it to function similarly to Super Sonic for gameplay purposes. Using Doom Wing properly will allow Shadow to take shortcuts and routes that would otherwise be impossible to reach, and this is especially true when navigating places like Radical Highway where there's lots of open space to glide across.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Hearts
   </strong>
  </em>
  series has long been celebrated for its eclectic blend of Disney crossovers, action RPG mechanics, complex narrative twists, and various sets of side activities which have helped to set most titles in the series apart. Throughout the franchise, there has been an array of memorable mini-game offerings that generally serve to be thematically resonant with their associated worlds, but one popular format of diversion has yet to make its debut in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  . With
  <em>
   KH4
  </em>
  on the horizon, now may be the perfect time for the series to introduce a fishing mechanic that could enhance immersion while bringing another flexible layer of gameplay to the table.

  Fishing may seem like a sport entirely disconnected from the likes of intense combat and emotional storytelling, but it has developed a habit of finding its way into many unlikely video game releases and garnering positive reception. From high-profile action RPGs to even fighting games, simulating the act of reeling in a big catch has managed to bring a desirable change of pace to several different IPs in a way that could easily tie into Sora's next adventure when considering the versatility of his signature
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  Keyblade.

  Despite what their slower pace might convey, fishing diversions have become a staple in many titles outside just the simulation genre.
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  titles since
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  have been known for making it an engaging part of interacting with the world of Hyrule, while even
  <em>
   FF15
  </em>
  managed to elevate it into a more detailed system that both rewards skill and offers a connection to its serene environments. Even the
  <em>
   Nier
  </em>
  games have used fishing as a way to break up the core gameplay and provide more in-game currency in a low-stakes fashion. With
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  taking on more life-simulation elements, it would only be proper to include a feature that previously made it into
  <em>
   Persona 4 Golden
  </em>
  .

 <h3 id="the-simple-concept-of-catching-rewards-transcends-contexts">

 <p>
  Even when it comes to a title such as
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , which is already focused on more cozy, simulation mechanics as a farming sim, fishing has been turned into a potentially intensely challenging portion of the game. On the other hand, recent
  <em>
   Guilty Gear
  </em>
  entries have incorporated a simplistic fishing mini-game as their format for acquiring unlockables in a thematically memorable manner. When it comes to implementing a system with so much possible versatility,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  ' distinct Keyblades could easily align with its introduction.

  While mini-games in previous
  <em>
   KH
  </em>
  titles, from the fare of the 100 Acre Wood in the main trilogy to the likes of Ice Cream Beat in
  <em>
   Birth by Sleep
  </em>
  , are largely limited to specific contextual locations, a fishing activity would be able to be present across different worlds. Sora's Kingdom Key Keyblade, with its various keychain options and already hook-like structure, could easily take on a new transformation to become a fishing rod for a natural integration of the system. With stat benefits similar to those in combat, these options could make fishing a meaningful form of progression over the course of
  <em>

  </em>
  's different worlds.

 <p>
  Each
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  world has its own distinct licensed identity, and fishing could complement the differences between them by introducing unique catches for each. It's already reasonable to imagine there being exclusive fish for The Caribbean or Atlantica, and the new worlds of the upcoming title could have this kind of fauna to help flesh them out. Caught fish could go beyond collectibles, helping to support an evolution of cooking in the Bistro in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  by contributing to crafting items. As much as Sora's new Keyblade arsenal could enable him to progress in fishing throughout the game, the rewards earned along the way have just as much potential for progression.

  Although still unreleased,
  <em>
   Deadlock

  is a 6v6 MOBA shooter developed and published by Valve. Despite still being in its closed beta state,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  has gained significant popularity on Steam, showing high player counts and a dedicated community. With proven success already, the developers behind
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  have been working hard on updates to continue improving the game and pushing it closer to an official release.

  Shared on
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  's official forum, the October 24th update brings a variety of changes to the game. Much like the last update for
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  , this patch adds some additional features to the game, with the biggest being the Hero Labs. Hero Labs allows players to test out new heroes and provide early feedback on their development. Currently, there are six heroes for players to try out, but it is expected that characters in this mode will be consistently added, removed, or have abilities and models changed.

  Alongside the addition of new features, this patch also brings in several balance changes to the already playable heroes in

  . Most notable, several audio issues were fixed, with a few abilities and important events in the game that were missing sound cues finally receiving the appropriate sound effect. Alongside this, several changes were made to a variety of items in
  <em>
   Deadlock.
  </em>
  A ton of Weapon Items had their damage and cooldowns balanced, some Vitality Items received minor reworks, and nearly every Spirit Item was tweaked in some way.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Added 6 new heroes to Hero Labs, a new experimental hero matchmaking mode. The heroes are Holliday, Calico, Wrecker, Fathom, Viper and Magician (temp names). The goal of this mode is to invite players to help us in giving hero design feedback while heroes are in very early phases.
  </li>
  <li>
   Most heroes in this mode will have placeholder models, names, effects, etc (some exceptions are older in-dev heroes that had more developed art). They will also sometimes have placeholder/copy-paste abilities for certain slots if that ability slot is still TBD (such as Magician ultimate).
  </li>
  <li>
   There will be a specific hero labs section on the forum to post feedback on these. Heroes in this mode will often be removed, abilities changed, new heroes added, removed heroes re-added, etc. Patch notes for changes to heroes in this mode will be posted on the Hero Labs subforum.
  </li>
  <li>
   This mode will have limited testing hours for now while we gauge activity, in order to ensure faster queue times. You must have at least 50 games played to be able to queue here. If you don't get a new hero selected (since there are less new heroes than there are players), you will be considered higher priority for subsequent matches to get a new hero from your roster selection.
  </li>
 </ul>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic X Shadow Generations
   </strong>
  </em>
  just launched but is already a huge hit, with the game managing to sell a million units on release day. The success of
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  isn't too surprising for Sonic fans, as it has been one of the most eagerly anticipated of 2024. While the game includes a remaster of 2011's
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  , the main draw for many is Shadow the Hedgehog's solo campaign. Not only is Sonic's anti-hero rival put into the spotlight since his last playable appearance in 2017's
  <em>
   Sonic Forces
  </em>
  , but the character's story and unique powers are the main reason why so many fans have been excited about this updated re-release.

  Three days before the game's official launch,
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  had an early access period for those who purchased the game's Digital Deluxe Edition. The reception to the remaster has been incredibly positive, with many dubbing it one of the best games in the franchise. Particular praise is being given for the title's focus on Shadow the Hedgehog and its gameplay, building upon the open-zone format found in
  <em>
   Sonic Frontiers
  </em>
  . Countless fans have been moved by Shadow's story, as it features tons of call-backs and Easter eggs to the character's history and lore. On launch day, the positive reception to
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  is already translating to successful numbers.

  According to a statement from Sega,
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  has officially surpassed 1 million units sold worldwide, marking a major milestone.
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  is now one of the fastest-selling games in the franchise, surpassing the launch sales numbers of
  <em>
   Sonic Frontiers
  </em>
  . For reference, the original
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  , which was released on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, sold 1.85 million copies by May 2012, meaning the remaster had already sold nearly half of the original's lifetime sales.

  The best-selling 3D
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game is currently
  <em>
   Sonic Frontiers
  </em>
  , which managed to sell over 3.5 million units by the end of April 2023 and surpassed the likes of the original
  <em>
   Sonic Colors
  </em>
  and the original
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  . The only other multiplatform 3D
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game to come close to this milestone is
  <em>
   Sonic Heroes
  </em>
  , which managed to sell 3.41 million copies by the end of 2007.
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  is already on its way to being one of the best-selling and most critically acclaimed 3D entries in the franchise.

  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  isn't the only way that Sega is celebrating Sonic's rival, as 2024 has been dubbed the Year of Shadow by the company. Shadow will be making his cinematic debut in Paramount's
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  film, which is similarly highly anticipated by fans. A Movie DLC Pack will also be coming to
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  ahead of
  <em>
   Sonic 3
  </em>
  's premiere.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed that Epic Games' battle royale could be working on a crossover with Pixar's
  <em>
   Monsters Inc
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has a significant list of crossovers with famous IPs inside and outside the gaming world. With this year's edition of D23,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is further expanding its partnership with Disney.

 <p>
  While Epic Games recently released new
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  skins, more content is coming in the next few months. Disney villains are coming to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for the first time this fall, while more
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  characters will get new cosmetics. Even Pixar has been remembered, and it has been confirmed that
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  will be joining
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's roster of characters, with the release of skins for Frozone, Mr. Incredible, and Elastigirl. Now, a new
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  rumor is circulating, and it is reported that another popular Disney IP may be on its way to the game.

  Released in 2001,
  <em>
   Monsters Inc.
  </em>
  is the fourth film produced by Pixar. The film features monsters who work by scaring children to power the Monster World. But the story takes a different turn when James P. Sullivan and his assistant, Mike Wazowski, have to return a human girl named Boo after she enters the monster world. The success of the flick kicked off the
  <em>
   Monsters Inc.
  </em>
  universe, with the prequel film
  <em>
   Monsters University
  </em>
  hitting theaters in 2013, and adaptations for other media such as games, animated shorts, and theme park attractions.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players should always take leaks with a pinch of salt, as information has the chance to change along the way. It's important to note, however, that the crossover with
  <em>
   Monsters Inc.
  </em>
  is yet another in the list of recent reports about potential
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collaborations. A leak recently revealed that
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is working on a crossover with
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  , although it didn't give any further details. Among the Disney-related news already confirmed,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  will see the addition of Doctor Doom next season, and the inclusion of even more Marvel-themed cosmetics.

  Audiences are being terrified by aliens known as Xenomorphs yet again with the release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien: Romulus
   </em>
  </strong>
  . For over 45 years, the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise has been a staple of the theaters, but also video games with a plethora of tie-ins, and original games that expand the universe created by Ridley Scott and Dan O'Bannon.

 <p>
  Typically,
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  games focus on human characters outrunning or shooting down the Xenomorph menace, but occasionally, developers allow gamers to control said menace. Though not plentiful, there is a collective of video games that feature playable versions of the perfect organism.

  Fans of the franchise were excited about
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aliens: Colonial Marines
   </em>
  </strong>
  because it was hyped as a great sci-fi first-person shooter set after the events of James Cameron's
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, due to multiple promised aspects not present in the final product and broken coding for AI enemy aliens that turned the titular monsters into easy targets,
  <em>
   Colonial Marines
  </em>
  ended up with a poor reception.

 <p>
  The online multiplayer for
  <em>
   Aliens: Colonial Marines
  </em>
  allowed players to take control of the Xenomorph hordes and was arguably the superior mode for the game, but sadly, the servers are barren. The only way to get a match in to play as a Xenomorph would be to get a group of friends to create a custom match.

  As with many other franchises,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  collaborated with Alien to give fans not only Ellen Ripley in her
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  variants but also the Xenomorph itself, which was available in the skin pack. There is a nice emote to hear the Xeno let out its famous screech, but other than that, it plays no different from any other
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skin.

 <p>
  It may seem disappointing that
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  gives the Xenomorph no unique abilities, but there is a fear factor. Even in the family-friendly art style of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , the alien creature is still scary enough to instill fear into the player when they see it charging at them with an assault rifle or a shotgun.

  Often overshadowed by its successors, the 1994
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien Vs Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  was far ahead of its time as a first-person shooter exclusive to the often-forgotten Atari Jaguar. With digitized actors and props for sprites, the usage of short render distance to create dark levels, and the chance to play all three races, the original title paved the way for future games.

 <p>
  One way that
  <em>
   Alien Vs. Predator
  </em>
  stands out from the rest is that each playable race has its pros and cons. The Xenomorph is unable to heal, so it must cocoon Colonial Marines and upon dying, it will respawn from said cocoon. With the Marine and Predator having their unique mechanics, it kept the three campaigns from feeling identical and proved Rebellion was perfect for this franchise.

  When it comes to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens Vs. Predator
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, most fans think back to the series that started in 1999. Rebellion took the initial concept that was started with the Jaguar game and pushed it to a new level on PC; it was darker, bloodier, and far scarier than any Alien game that came prior.

 <p>
  Rebellion's
  <em>
   Aliens Vs. Predator
  </em>
  was also much more taxing on the player, with limited save states in each of the three campaigns. As the Xenomorph, the player focuses more on stealth and traversal across walls and ceilings, something that even the best 90s first-person shooters hadn't done before, and even though future games would evolve to do it better, it was still revolutionary.

  Games such as
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  prove how terrifying Xenomorphs can be, so that fear somehow gets worse with a player controlling one in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead By Daylight
   </strong>
  </em>
  . With the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  DLC expansion, gamers can stalk other human players, eliminating them by hanging them on hooks for the Entity like all other
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  killers or by using the famous inner mouth attack.

  Implementing a mechanic never seen in

  games,
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  harks back to famous scenes in which Xenomorphs can emerge from the walls of their hive. Via a series of underground tunnels, the Xenomorph can traverse and surprise survivors by emerging at many points on the map.

  From a facehugger to a chestburster and into a Xenomorph warrior,
  <em>
   Aliens Vs Predator 2
  </em>
  went all out in terms of upgrading the Alien campaign. The Colonial Marine and Predator were given upgrades as well, including even more horror for the Marine campaign. On top of it all,

  features a dedicated multiplayer fan with all three species being playable.

  Akin to the likes of

  ,
  <strong>
   <em>

  deviates from the first-person shooter formula of previous games in favor of a real-time strategy game. With Xenomorph, Colonial Marine, and Predator playable once again, the idea is fairly straightforward with building bases, raising armies, and accomplishing missions.

  Fans of the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise can still enjoy the game since
  <em>
   Aliens Vs. Predator: Extinction
  </em>
  is not too difficult to learn, but longtime RTS players won't feel alienated, since it is far from a cakewalk as well. It may not have the horror that some fans would expect from

   Alien

  , but it still delivers the thrills that a good RTS game should provide.

  With three variations focusing on acid, face-hugging, and slashing, the Xenomorph in

  is one of the more lethal characters to control. Its speed is one of the fastest in the game's roster, and it can attack from almost any range. Guest fighters in

  tend to be fun, but the Alien proved to be a favorite on the whole roster with standout fatalities from the movies.

  Fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  point out the issues with the restriction placed on competitive points that only allows them to earn 3,000 Competitive Points. Their dissatisfaction goes back to the change introduced in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Season 9.

 <p>
  At the start of Season 9 of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Blizzard introduced a slew of changes to the game, among which was a new way to earn Competitive Points. Players could earn 10 points for a win in a competitive match, five for a draw, and zero for a loss, lowering it from the previous 25 points earned for a win. To offset this, players were given a new type of Cosmetic Weapon variant to purchase from the shop called "Jade Weapons." However, each of these variants costs 3,000 Competitive Points, which is the earning cap for each
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  season starting from Season 9.

 <p>
  In a recent Reddit post, an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  player by the username MARiJNiBOii posted a screenshot of their Competitive Points. They point out that they have 2635 points, which means that they have not bought a weapon variant, while a pop-up informs them that they've reached the "maximum competitive points rewards." They go on to say that complications like these are "ridiculous," seeing as the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 9 points rework has made it so that earning points takes far longer than it previously did.

  This sparked a wave of criticism from other fans who dislike the current point system. Most agreed that the current point system missed the mark, wishing that Blizzard would revert the game back to the old one, while a minority pointed out the only silver lining to this system. Namely, this system battles botting to an extent by restricting bonus progression, since players would still get progress on the progression bar for losses. They argue that restricting competitive points in this way makes botting for competitive points not worth it. One player also mentioned that OP's screenshot could be an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  UI bug, as the only explanation of the problem that started the thread.

  The final point of contention players had with the current system was the Cosmetic Weapon variants available for purchase with 3,000 Competitive Points. These include the legacy Golden Guns in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , which are always available, and the new Jade Guns offered during the current season. Fans in the comments describe the Jade Guns as merely a green recoloring and anticipate that the next season's Cosmetic Weapon variants will simply be a blue or red version. As a result, they don't find them worth the investment.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Meme Sea
   </em>
  </strong>
  is is a
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  RPG based on the
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  anime. However, instead of the usual weapons and Devil Fruits, players must use memes. The enemies in this game may look funny, but does not make them less dangerous. So, you need to use all the ways to become stronger.

 <p>
  The Aura ability, which is quite difficult to get in
  <em>
   Meme Sea
  </em>
  , will help you in this regard. Aura does not give players attacking abilities, but buffs their Strength and Defence stats, so it will make your character much stronger. Here's how to get it in this
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game.

  Almost all abilities in
  <em>
   Meme Sea
  </em>
  can be learned with the help of suitable trainer NPCs, and Aura is no exception to the rule. To get Aura in
  <em>
   Meme Sea
  </em>
  , you need to
  <strong>
   find an Aura Master NPC and bring them 10 million Cash and Meme Cube.
  </strong>

 <p>
  You can find this NPC on
  <strong>
   Forgotten Island.
  </strong>
  Select this island in the compass menu and get to it by any available means. There, climb to the very top platform and find a large palm tree on the edge. The Aura Master NPC you need will be standing on it. However, finding them is not enough to get Aura in
  <em>
   Meme Sea
  </em>
  .

  Obtaining The Meme Cube
 </h3>
 <p>
  To get the Aura ability from the Aura Master, you will need to bring them a
  <strong>
   Meme Cube.
  </strong>
  This is the most difficult part of the quest, since the Meme Cube drops from only one enemy: the
  <strong>
   Meme Beast.
  </strong>
  This boss spawns every 30 minutes in the sea near
  <strong>
   Floppa Island.
  </strong>

 <p>
  The Meme Beast is a level 2000 boss with 1,000,000 HP, so it is quite difficult to defeat it solo, especially if your level is below 1000. Therefore, you will need the help of other players. It is also worth noting that because the boss spawns in the middle of the sea, players using Powers may have difficulties during the battle.

 <p>
  When you defeat the Meme Beast, then, provided you have dealt enough damage, there is a 50% chance you will get a Meme Cube. After that, you need to save up to 10 million Cash and go to the Aura Master NPC to get the Aura ability in
  <em>
   Meme Sea
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Initially, you have a default Aura color. By visiting the
  <strong>
   Halfed Sorcerer NPC in the Arena
  </strong>
  , you can unlock a new color in exchange for Gems. It is important to note that this is only a cosmetic change, and does not affect the ability bonuses. Players can then visit the Aura Colour Storage NPC to select one of the available Aura colors.

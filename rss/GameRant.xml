  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  ’s setting is the kind of apocalyptic hellhole where pretty much everything is out to kill the player. To survive, one needs a good gun and an even better set of armor. For the best protection, players will want some Power Armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , Bethesda made some major changes to Power Armor. The suits are more akin to vehicles than traditional RPG armor, requiring both a chassis and a fusion core to work. The game features several iconic sets, but some are definitely better than others.

   Amazingly, Fallout 4 will be ten years old this year. With Season 2 of Amazon's Fallout series still at least a year away and the next Fallout game being even further, fans are probably looking for their next fix. So, why not go back and replay Fallout 4 for the hundredth time? Doing so is also recommended since last year's big update added some Creation Club Content to the base game, including three whole new suits of power armor. For those looking to dive in, this list has been updated to feature the
   <strong>
    best places to find a full set of each power armor
   </strong>
   , as well as where to find any fancy unique variants.

   Raider Power Armor
  </strong>
  has the worst stats of any Power Armor in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , hands down. Hobbled together from pieces of junk by
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's infamous raider gang, this set is as basic as it gets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other power armor sets, it has fewer upgrade options but is much cheaper to repair. Unless players like the rustic look, there's no reason to bother with this option, and using it is a waste of fusion cores.

    Found next to the crashed Vertibird on the Museum of Freedom's roof during the When Freedom Calls story quest. The left arm and right leg are badly damaged, but the T-45 is cheap to repair.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Depending on the player's level, the Piezonucleic unique chest piece can be crafted while completing the unmarked Cambridge Polymer Labs quest southeast of Cambridge Police Station. The armor speeds up the Action Point recharge rate in relation to how high the Sole Survivor's rads are.
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In canon, the
  <strong>
   T-45
  </strong>
  was the first ever power armor deployed by the U.S. military - meaning, by
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  standards, it's pretty out of date. In-game, it's likely to be the first power armor set the lone wanderer will come across and can be found during the early When Freedom Calls quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The T-45 is a nice step up from the raider armor since it has a lot more upgrade options, although it is more expensive to repair. Most players will likely quickly leave their T-45 armor behind, but those with a soft spot for it should hunt down the Piezonucleic chest piece variant at Cambridge Polymer Labs.

    Found shortly after starting the

  The
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise has a lot of great DLC, and one of the best is
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Nuka-World
  </em>
  . This expansion added a lot of cool items, including the
  <strong>
   Overboss Power Armor Set
  </strong>
  . The armor is received as a reward for defeating the expansion's first boss and is a nice little upgrade over the basic Raider Power Armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a start, it looks cooler and features a more "bulked up" design with some nice nods to its theme park origins on the back. Even better, all its defensive stats are much higher (although worse than most other sets), and the armor has a unique modifier. When wearing the armor, the player will periodically deal energy damage to nearby enemies, making it a nice match for melee lovers.

    A set can be found at the National Guard Training Yard in a shipping crate behind the armory. The player must be under level 28 and have the Expert lockpicking skill in order to get it.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>

    Another set can be found next to a crashed Vertibird on the freeway east of Graygarden as long as the player is over level 15.

    At higher levels, the Piezonucleic T-51 chest piece is crafted during the Cambridge Polymer Labs quest.

 </ul>
 <p>
  There's not a lot to say about the
  <strong>
   T-51
  </strong>
  , except that it's like the T-45 but better. Developed by West Tek, this armor entered service just one year before the bombs fell and took ten years to develop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much like its elder sibling, there's a chance of getting a Piezonucleic chest-piece variant during the Cambridge Polymer Labs Quest. T-51 pieces can be found all over the Wasteland and the armor isn't too expensive to upgrade, making it a nice stepping stone before players move on to more advanced power armors.

    A full set is found in the Nuka-Cola bottling plant in
    <em>

    's World of Refreshment. The set is locked behind a gate that can be unlocked by hacking a nearby Expert-level terminal or using the password.

 <p>
  Nuka-Cola is a big part of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's lore, so it's not really surprising that one of the game's most unique power armor sets is a piece of Nuka-Cola branding. The armor is relatively easy to get and can be looted from the
  <em>
   Nuka-World
  </em>
  DLC's World of Refreshment location.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stats-wise, the
  <strong>
   Nuka T-51
  </strong>
  is the same as a vanilla set of T-51 armor. However, it comes with two nice upgrades. Firstly, the armor comes with a very snazzy-looking unique paint job. Secondly, equipping all pieces provides a handy +3 Agility bonus. The only downside is that material mods cannot be applied to this armor, which may mess with some players' builds.

  Anyone even a little bit familiar with
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  should recognize the
  <strong>
   T-60
  </strong>
  power armor. It's the iconic armor most commonly seen being worn by the Brotherhood of Steel faction.
 </p>
 <p>
  The T-60 was brought into service right at the end of the war and, at the time, was considered to be the most advanced model of power armor to have ever seen action. Stats-wise, the armor is a step up from almost every piece of armor in the game and has some of the best upgrade options. There's also a unique "Tesla" variant of the arm and chest pieces that gives up to a 15% bonus to energy weapon damage.

  The
  <strong>
   X-01
  </strong>
  is the most advanced power armor in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . According to
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  lore, work began on the X-01 power armor just before the end of the Great War but wasn't completed until much later - around 2220 by the evil Enclave.
 </p>
 <p>
  The X-01 is hands down the best vanilla power armor in the game and offers the best defensive stats. Amazingly, it's also shockingly easy to get a full suit early on in the game. A complete set of X-01 armor can be found on the roof of 35 Court in Boston's Financial District, and another can be found on the back of a truck just west of Dry Rock Gulch. Its great stats, upgrade options, and easy availability mean that there's little reason to bother with any of the other Power Armors in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  .

    This unique set is in a display case on the first floor of Starport Nuka in

 <p>
  If players are willing to complete one of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's most frustrating quests and collect 35 star cores hidden throughout
  <em>
   Nuka-World
  </em>
  , their reward is the game's best power armor. The
  <strong>
   Quantum X-01
  </strong>
  is a unique variant of the standard X-01 armor that comes with a sweet custom Quantum blue paint job and a unique perk - faster action point refresh speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Better still, it comes already upgraded to Mk 5, making it the most powerful complete suit that can be found in the game, saving the player from having to spend precious resources on upgrading it. The only downside to wearing either version of the X-01 is that it arguably makes the game too easy. Getting the Quantum X-01 in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  might take a while, but it's worth the effort.

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Of the three new armors added in the Next-Gen update, the
  <strong>
   Hellfire Power Armor
  </strong>
  is probably the least impressive. It's looted from Pyro, a member of the Forged Raider gang, during the Pyromaniac quest, and it is incredibly similar to the original X-01 power armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has the same physical resistance as the X-01 but slightly higher energy resistance. On the other hand, its overall HP is lower than the X-01's, being the same as the T-60's. That means which is better between the two is largely a matter of taste; or which one the player thinks looks better, probably.

 <p>
  The best thing we can say about the
  <strong>
   Enclave Hellfire Armor
  </strong>
  is that it looks better than the standard version. The Enclave version can be looted from Hellfire Enclave Troopers during Echoes of the Pass after being ambushed on the way to Saugus Ironworks, or can be found at the Atlantic Offices in the Glowing Sea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its stats are around the same as the normal Hellfire armor, except the Enclave variant has better energy resistance. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of even lower armor HP. This means that unless the player knows they're going up against enemies that exclusively use energy weapons, either the normal X-01 or the new X-02 armor are probably a better option.

  The

   X-02
  </strong>
  is a modest upgrade on
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's former best power armor, the X-01. Developed in-house by the Enclave Department of the Army, it has a slightly bulkier design than the X-01 and almost the same stats, apart from having better energy resistance and a higher HP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Curious players can get their hands on a full set of the armor in the Mass Pike Tunnel during the "Speak of the Devil" quest, or loot the pieces separately off of fallen Enclave soldiers during "Echoes of the Past." The best thing about the X-02 is its upgrade options is, unlike other power armors, the X-02 can be equipped with any power armor mod. Even better, it can be fitted with the Devil's Inferno mod (found in the Mass Pike Tunnel), which is an upgraded version of the Tesla coils. Better stats and more upgrade options are rarely a bad thing, making the X-02 a great addition to the game.

  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  developer
  <strong>
   Crystal Dynamics
  </strong>
  has recently laid off 17 employees. The game industry has been facing a rough time as development costs increase and faith in the industry seems to be low. Crystal Dynamics is likely the latest company to use layoffs as a way to deal with the current crisis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Created back in 1992, Crystal Dynamics has created some highly popular franchises such as
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Gex
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Soul Reaver
  </em>
  . In the last few years, the studio has been mostly known for the newest
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  trilogy, released between 2013 and 2018, and
  <em>
   Marvel’s Avengers
  </em>
  in 2020. Until 2022, the developer belonged to Square Enix, but it was then sold to the Embracer Group, which currently owns it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that 17 employees have been laid off from the company. According to the official announcement, the decision was made to “better align our current business needs and the studio's future success,” and it will not alter any current plans the company has. Crystal Dynamics' official website states that the studio has over 300 employees, so these recent layoffs have likely impacted less than 10% of the company.

 <p>
  It’s currently unknown if these layoffs will affect the development of games such as
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  and the next entry in the
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  franchise in any way. Back in 2024, it was reported that
  <em>

  ’s development was already in turmoil, as the game was in a very rough state.
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  was originally being developed by Microsoft’s The Initiative Studio, and Crystal Dynamics started to collaborate on the game’s development in 2021.

  Unfortunately, it’s not entirely surprising to see Crystal Dynamics laying off employees. Apart from the potentially serious troubles with
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  , other recent projects of the studio, such as
  <em>
   Marvel’s Avengers
  </em>
  , failed to connect with the public, as the title was delisted from all stores in September 2023.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crystal Dynamics’ owner, Embracer Group, has also been planning more layoffs since the start of 2025, with some of its studios, such as Black Forest Games, cutting as much as half of its entire staff. Last month, the company's CEO, Lars Wingefors, revealed that the recent layoffs at the Embracer Group were designed to maximize shareholder value, a remark that was met with strong backlash at the time. In any case, it remains to be seen how Crystal Dynamics will be after the layoffs, and whether it will negatively influence projects such as
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  or the next
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   Expertise Quests are unique challenges
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , each
  <strong>
   consisting of five total stages
  </strong>
  for players to progress through. Unlike regular quests, which exclusively offer XP as a reward, Expertise Quests are very different, as each is tied to one of the many NPCs around the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  By completing them, players will
  <strong>
   unlock special sales on the items that each NPC sells
  </strong>
  , along with a few additional tasks that reward players with XP. These items range from a Collateral Damage Assault Rifle to a guaranteed Dill Bit, making progression through each questline well worth the effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  To view the Expertise Quests, players can simply
  <strong>
   navigate to the Expertise Tab under Quests
  </strong>
  , either in the main lobby or during a game of Battle Royale/Zero Build. To make tracking their progress easier, players can also track each stage by selecting it and hitting the Track Quest option.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Shadows is Getting Positive Reviews in Japan</title>

    <ul>
     <li>
      Assassin's Creed Shadows received positive reviews from some Japanese critics.
     </li>
     <li>
      The game's dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke, were mostly well-received by reviewers.

 <p>
  Many Japanese critics are reportedly enjoying the recently released
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin’s Creed Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Ubisoft Quebec’s stunning reconstruction of Feudal Japan in
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has impressed reviewers, despite the game’s highly controversial launch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  was finally released on March 20 after several delays and one of the most controversial developments in the franchise’s 18-year history. Many fans eagerly awaited an opportunity to explore feudal Japan, but the developer’s choice of dual protagonists sparked heated debate. While stealthy Japanese shinobi Naoe was widely anticipated as a welcome return to the series’ roots after the action-adventure combat of
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  , the hack-n-slash fighter Yasuke proved far more contentious. Even though supporters pointed out that the black sword-wielding warrior was a historical figure documented to be in Japan during the Sengoku period, critics were quick to question his actual status and in-game depiction as a samurai, with the debate even drawing the attention of Elon Musk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Polygon has compounded reviews from top Japanese outlets including Dengeki, Game Watch, Gamer, and 4Gamer, and found that the finely crafted, immersive rendition of Feudal Japan has struck a chord with gamers on both sides of the Pacific. Critics have now had their hands on
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  for a week, and reviews are mostly positive.
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  currently enjoys a healthy OpenCritic score of 81, placing it just two points below
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  and three behind
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  . Contrary to the skeptic’s argument that players would prefer a purely Japanese player character and story,
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  seems to be enjoying similarly positive praise from Japan.

 <p>
  Accentuated by the game’s impressive seasonal weather effects, the verdant mountainous scenery and bustling cities proved a remarkably accurate highlight, with one 4Gamer reviewer even calling the scenery “nostalgic” of his childhood. Equally praised were the game’s protagonists, with one review claiming “Naoe embodies the spirit of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist” with a deeper, more relatable connection to the game’s story. Slightly more criticism was aimed at Yasuke’s exaggerated characterization as a “perfect samurai” without any real faults. However, all outlets acknowledged his presence as a historical figure and even referred to him as a samurai. This acknowledgment echoes the earlier sentiment of
  <em>
   Bayonetta
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  creator Hideki Kamiya that the controversy surrounding
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  was overblown by a loud but vocal minority of players and not an opinion shared by the majority of gamers.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Ubisoft Quebec may have gained the critics’ favor, the developer has also worked hard behind the scenes to appease the concerns of the Japanese Government. After a recent gameplay clip surfaced showing a player defacing an in-game replica of the Itatehyozu Shinto Shrine, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba issued a statement to deter any potential real-world vandals inspired by the game. Ubisoft Quebec has since issued a patch to make certain unique objects found in shrines and temples indestructible.

  Though the main draw of a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  game is always the long and engaging story mode, this series has been known for its fun and engaging variety of bonus modes, too. Whether it's the action-packed Mercenaries mode, chaotic PVP modes, or even side stories, there have been tons of exciting bonus game modes that do a good job at encouraging players to continue returning to the game even after the credits roll.
 </p>
 <p>
  While some
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  titles only offer players one or two extra game modes to play around with, others provide a much healthier variety, to the point where some consider these extra bits of content to be more engaging than the story itself. Anyone looking for an excuse to boot up some
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games but doesn't want to play through the main stories again ought to check out these titles below.

 <p>
  Though
  <em>
   <strong>
    Operation Raccoon City
   </strong>
  </em>
  came out during a low-point for the series, looking back, the game had some genuinely innovative and interesting multiplayer modes, many of which are still active to this day. The Heroes Mode would be Capcom's first and only crack at a
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  hero shooter, and while it definitely feels a little unbalanced, being able to jump in with series legends who all possess their own abilities and weapons is still terrifically fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other PVP modes are more focused on competing against the enemy team for objectives, such as collecting bio-samples, all while the undead roam the map and feast on anyone who they run into during the match. While the extra single-player content is severely lacking,
  <em>
   Operation Raccoon City
  </em>
  provides a lot for PVP fans.

 <p>
  While the Mercenaries mode was technically first introduced with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  , Capcom would refine it and make it a little more rewarding to play with the iconic fourth entry in the series. With five characters to choose from and four stages, including the infamous Water World stage that features the Super Salvador, there's a lot of chaotic fun to be had, but the real meat of the bonus content comes with the Ada side stories.
 </p>
 <p>
  Separate Ways, while nowhere near as lengthy as its remake, is still a quick and easy story, standing apart from the main story thanks to its new cutscenes and boss enemies. Assignment: Ada is more of a straight-up arcade shooter, though that's far from a bad thing, especially for those who are fans of the more action-heavy games in the series.

  While all the bonus modes in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2 Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  are time trials, there are still plenty of them to get through to ensure players aren't fighting their way through the same area over and over again. Fourth Survivor is the most well-known and enjoyable of the bunch, following HUNK as he tries to make a desperate escape from the zombie-infested city before the bombs arrive. Since this game is a lot more stripped-back on the melee combat, it means each and every single zombie poses a threat, and with swarms of them standing in HUNK's way, it makes for an exhilarating extra bit of content to play through.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's also Ghost Survivors, which acts as a "what if?" scenario for four side characters who met their fate in the main campaign. These stories are brutally difficult to overcome with a high ranking, which adds a lot to their replayability. And this is all without even mentioning Tofu, a fun little gag mode that Capcom decided to insert into the game, which is always a blast to play around with.

  Raid Mode was a bonus challenge mode first introduced to the series with
  <em>
   Resident Evil: Revelations
  </em>
  on the 3DS. While the core gameplay loop and upgrade system helped the mode feel like a breath of fresh air from what had come before, Capcom would double down and build upon the foundation they had set with the sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Revelations 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The main goal of a typical match is to simply complete objectives and make it to the end of a level, but because of how many weapons, upgrades, and characters there are up for grabs, it makes the grind pretty enjoyable. It also helps that
  <em>
   Revelations 2
  </em>
  allows Raid Mode to be played both online and through split-screen thanks to it not being released on a handheld like its predecessor.

  While the main story of the remake to the beloved
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  is already fantastic, the game features one extra bonus game mode, along with a DLC side story that players can dive into after Leon's mission finally ends. The Mercenaries mode from the original game is back, and while the same characters are all here, each of them has been given unique abilities to feed into different playstyles. Luis, for example, is capable of using dynamite to blow groups of Ganados into smithereens; meanwhile, Ada can zip around the map like nobody's business thanks to her grappling hook.
 </p>
 <p>
  While getting an S rank on each of the four maps isn't quite as difficult as it is in other iterations of the mode, it's still a blast to return to for quick and short sessions.
  <em>
   Separate Ways
  </em>
  is really the star of the show here, though, with it now being much longer than it was previously and featuring tons of new bosses and areas to make for an excellent bonus story.

   <strong>
    Resident Evil 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game often credited for its excellent incorporation of co-op mechanics into its gameplay, and it works just as well in the bonus game modes as it does in the main campaign. The Mercenaries mode, which is arguably the best iteration seen in the entire series, presents a fast-paced and incredibly fun challenge that becomes extremely addictive considering how many characters are available to get onto the leaderboards because of the Mercenaries Reunion update.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two side stories, Lost in Nightmares and Desperate Escape, also offer a nice break from the main story. While the former of the two is a slow and creepy prequel level that focuses on Chris and Jill, the latter is a much more chaotic and action-packed story, following Josh and Jill as they get all kinds of monsters and B.O.W.s thrown their way. Even today,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  still has an active player base for its bonus modes, and that's a testament to just how fun they are to jump into.

  is a game packed full of extra content, but it's honestly quite staggering just how diverse all these modes are regarding what they offer. On the one hand, there are the Banned Footage levels, where players take control of a previous victim of the Baker family as they partake in a bunch of sick and twisted mini-games.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there are also the side-stories, which manage to play very differently to the main story thanks to the protagonists. Chris, who plays the lead role in Not a Hero, is built to be much more of a run-and-gun kind of character compared to Ethan; meanwhile Joe can use his giant metal fists to knock out any Molded monsters who stand in his way. The amount of content is more than enough to provide roughly the same amount of playtime as the story itself, and the best part is that all of it is fun to play.

   <strong>
    Resident Evil 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  is often considered the most action-heavy entry in the series, and while that didn't sit well with everyone when it came to the main stories, it would be much better implemented in the bonus modes, and it's fair to say that there's no shortage of them to enjoy. Alongside the Mercenaries mode making a return, this time with characters who are able to perform all kinds of big and bombastic melee attacks, there's also several PVP modes, including Survivors, Predator, and Onslaught.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's not all though, as there's even a mode called Agent Hunt, which allows players to assume control of a monster in someone else's story. This made for a fascinating and pretty fun idea that has not been seen in the series since. Then, there's Siege mode, a mode where one team acts as B.O.W.s while the others play as humans who must protect a group of civilians by any means necessary. The stories of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  may be divisive, but in terms of bonus content and replay value, it is the very best game in the series due to the quantity and variety.

  sees players return to the role of Max Caulfield, this time as an older and more mature woman (although her quirks remain the same). Since the first game, Max has all but abandoned her powers, dealing with the trauma of
  <em>

  </em>
  's two endings in her own way. However, when a close friend named Safi is murdered, she tries again to save her. Max's time-rewind powers, however, have been replaced with new Shift powers that let her manipulate two different timelines: one where Safi is dead and one where Safi is alive. That mystery is no doubt the driving force behind the game, but fans no doubt have a lot of questions heading into its October release.

  At Gamescom, Game Rant sat down with
  <em>
   Life is Strange: Double Exposure
  </em>
  director Jonathan Stauder and writer Aysha Farah to talk about the demo we played, the development of powers in the franchise, and of course, the big thing in bringing back Max Caulfield.
  <strong>

  <strong>
   Stauder:
  </strong>
  When we start these games, we look at what would make an interesting power in terms of telling a character's story, what works well turned into game mechanics, and what not. We tend to develop what that person goes through with that power. We were really interested in this new power of shifting between two timelines and seeing the differences between them. What happens when someone precious is taken away, and that ends up being a vehicle to possibly look at Max's life after the first Life is Strange game and process what happened.

 <p>
  The first game ends in that major choice, and there are about 3 to 5 minutes to act it out. There's no processing, so with this power and Max, there's a natural progression. There is more story to tell there.

  : It was kind of an egg and chicken situation where like...Max with the power, it just fits. Enough time has passed, and this idea started when you take into account the choices of the first game.

   Farah
  </strong>
  : Yeah. At the time, we got to tell a story about Max, who was a teenager in the first game. She was not, as I've been saying, fully cooked yet, so to speak. Having this gap in time lets us come back and get to meet her as an older woman with a job and a different group of friends, stuff like that. I also think that enough time has passed from the time the game came out that the audience has sort of grown with Max, so people who loved the game as teenagers are now kind of going through the same life stage as Max.

  <strong>
   Farah
  </strong>
  :
  <em>
  </em>
  We talked a lot about this just because so much time has passed where everybody has had the chance to settle in with Max and have Max in their brain. They know who she is and remember her from the first game. We were really careful to think about the details that we knew made Max, like there were some very iconic quirks we didn't want to lose. We didn't want to lose the kind of corny jokes that she makes...I think we called those Dad Jokes in Double Exposure. The little puns that she does, her tendency to talk to inanimate objects, like "Hello, Mr. Plants," little things like that.

 <p>
  Then, we thought she's probably matured a little now and that she's a little more outgoing. I think she's a little braver when it comes to making friends and less of a wallflower than she was. She's an instructor now instead of a student. She has this relationship where she's responsible for some of the people around her in a way that she hasn't been in the past.

   Stauder

  : Another big part to make sure Max is recognizable as Max is we brought back Hannah Telle. Max's voice is so important to her character, and Hannah genuinely embodies the character naturally. We're lucky that she wanted to come back and play Max.

  <strong>
   Stauder:
  </strong>
  It definitely affects things in the game. One core conceit is that, no matter which ending you got, Max has this trauma she has to process. What flavor of trauma it is is specific to which choice players make and that informs so much about where Max needs to grow as a character and very much how she moves past it. It affects the way you're going to experience the story."

  Yeah. We want to make sure that the story respects the choices that you made in the first game because I know that a lot of people, including me, are very attached to the way the story played out for them. The ways Max relates to her past relates to people, and like you said, the journal and stuff give insight into that core aspect of her life.

  She discovers [her new powers] when she tries to use them. Because she hasn't used them in forever, she has the unexpected result where she suddenly snaps across an alternate timeline. She discovers she can actually move between the two timelines. When you play the later chapters, you get a little more attached to her existing powers and understand, maybe, where the powers come from in the story.

  : You're actually touching upon a third part of the power where she's up against something she can't just pick up and take it across the timeline, and she physically can Shift it. We'll see that return in later chapters, and further permutations of using Shifting under different circumstances, like in a tense action sequence, a chase sequence, or other detective-type scenes. Generally, you'll always have something interesting to ease into with her Shift Powers, where you can see into the other timeline, hear into it, and all that stuff.

  One of the biggest things that Deck Nine did on True Colors to evolve the series was push performance acting. It was the first performance capture installment in the franchise, and we push that further [with Double Exposure]. Our characters look and react better than True Colors, which is already fantastic, and that just allows us a greater medium to tell our story better because our characters can realistically reflect the performances of our actors.

  Scorched Earth is the original boss battle in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Players from all over the server tend to join in when this event is in progress. It's a fast-paced event that sees players battle against the Scorchbeast Queen. This battle is no walk in the park. Players will go through a lot of bullets in order to take down the Queen.

  It's a fun repeatable event that is great for earning XP, farming legendary items, and stockpiling repair kits. It's not uncommon to find a server that is covered in blast zones, as there are plenty of players out there who enjoy grinding this event over and over again.

 <p>
  Starting the event is a whole event in itself. Scorched Earth is a nuked event. So,
  <strong>
   you'll need to launch a nuke in order to trigger the event.
  </strong>
  It's important to keep in mind that there is a cooldown period for each silo. If another player has recently launched a nuke, then you may need to hop to a new server to be able to launch a nuke.

 <p>
  After you've made your way through any of the three silos, you'll need to pop in a Nuclear Keycard and enter the launch codes before you gain access to the nuke launch map. When you open up the nuke map, you'll need to launch the nuke over Fissure Site Prime to trigger the Scorched Earth event.

 <p>
  As a tip for newer players, to make the event a little bit easier, launch the nuke so that it covers Fissure Site Prime, but doesn't touch Drop Site V9. Drop Site V9 is a great area for battling the Scorchbeast Queen. If this area is nuked, then players will need to suit up in either a set of Power Armor or a radiation suit to enter the area, which can make things a bit more difficult.

  There is only one objective for this event; killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
  <strong>
   Players will have 30 minutes to take down the Scorchbeast Queen.
  </strong>
  Thankfully, very rarely will the player find themselves fighting the Scorchbeast Queen alone. The event is a popular one! When it's active, you can expect multiple players to join in the battle.

  The Scorchbeast Queen is a very tough enemy. She has an incredibly high damage resistance, she can fly, she summons endless waves of Scorched Enemies, and she has deadly armor-piercing attacks. That said, there are some things that players can do to make the event easier. See the list of tips below to make taking down the Scorchbeast Queen a little bit easier:

   Use the
   <strong>
    Concentrated Fire perk
   </strong>
   and try to cripple her wings. This will force her to land.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use a
   <strong>
    Cryolator
   </strong>
   to dramatically slow down her movements.
  </li>
  <li>
   Try to jump onto the top of the building in
   <strong>

   or onto a
   <strong>
    Survival Tent
   </strong>
   to help prevent the summoned Scorched enemies from getting to you.
  </li>
  <li>
   Watch the Scorchbeast Queen's movements. Just before she makes a landing, she will stop and fly up before coming down to the ground.
   <strong>
    Use this time to get close to her

  Players can expect to receive some nice items for completing this event. While players will receive things like XP, Caps, ammo, and other random items, this isn't what most players are interested in. Completing Scorched Earth rewards each participant with 2-3 Improved Repair Kits. These are much better than standard Repair Kits. They will instantly fix any armor piece or weapon to 150% of its condition.

  Not only that, but there's a small chance for players to be awarded one of the rare Power Armor plans. While not all of the Power Armor plans are valuable, there are a handful that will fetch tens of thousands of Caps. Plans like Ultracite Tesla Coils and Ultracite Emergency Protocols are rare plans that are hard to come by. Scorched earth is one of only a few ways that players can obtain them.

  This year's deluge of Soulslike and Soulslike-adjacent games continues with September's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Similar to Game Science's
  <em>
   Black Myth Wukong
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  is the debut AAA title from Italian studio Jyamma Games and utilizes the developer's country as a setting to give
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  a distinct atmosphere that taps into the developers' culture. Of course, the Soulslike genre is becoming an increasingly crowded space, prompting developers to implement unique mechanics in their games in hopes of helping them stand out among the pack. One of
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's best aces up its sleeve is the game's approach to character builds, both in terms of variety and flexibility.

  's defining feature as a Soulslike, and one which is sure to draw the attention of genre fans, is the ability to instantly swap between three customizable builds without needing to respec. The different masks that the titular main character can equip can be customized and hot-swapped on the fly, allowing players to have specific loadouts at the ready for dealing with mobs, ranged enemies, or bosses. It's a great way to encourage players to experiment with different gear and loadouts to find what works best for their playstyle, and it also happens to take a page out of the Metroidvania playbook in a way that other games should follow.

 <p>
  The inner circle of the Venn diagram containing Metroidvanias and Soulslikes continues to get bigger by the day, which makes sense given how well both genre's mechanics complement each other. While it's nowhere near the same level of "Soulsvanias" like
  <em>
   Death's Gambit
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Salt and Sanctuary
  </em>
  in terms of its build crafting, the recently released
  <em>
   Frontier Hunter: Erza's Wheel of Fortune
  </em>
  implements the ability to swap between three different characters, each with their own loadout.
  <em>
   Erza
  </em>
  already bears a striking resemblance to the well-received
  <em>
   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  , but its implementation of an oft-requested feature that still has yet to find its way into
  <em>
   Bloodstained
  </em>
  (loadout-swapping) immediately sets it apart from its inspiration.

  The ability to hot-swap between builds in
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  thanks to the masks that the player can equip is also somewhat similar to another unconventional Soulslike,
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  . Rather than restrict players to one specific build,
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  allows players to switch between equippable "Shells," though this freedom comes at the cost of customization and specific gear optimization. Comparatively,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  seems to find a comfortable middle ground between the two, offering players the opportunity to customize the loadouts attached to each mask while also preventing them from needing to stick to one specific build short of a total respec.

  FromSoftware continues to be undisputed in terms of its design and craftsmanship of games within the "Souls" genre. Fitting, considering the studio's own
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  is where the subset of difficult, combat-focused action RPGs gets its name. That said, there's nothing preventing the studio from iterating on the ideas of other talented developers who are attempting to move the Soulslike needle forward, and that's where
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's multiple-build system comes in. FromSoftware has already made changing builds easier than ever before in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  thanks to the abundance of Larval Tears, and the studio's next game could take things even further.

 <p>
  An
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  follow-up or brand-new IP utilizing Soulsborne mechanics that allows for multiple builds in a single playthrough would be a great way for FromSoftware to continue inching toward greater accessibility. Further, to prevent players from completely breaking the game's balance, the existence of multiple builds in a single playthrough could have a trade-off in the form of no respec options. Whatever the case, having multiple builds available at a moment's notice depending on the situation would practically be a dream come true for a Soulslike, and
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's realization of that dream makes it worth fans' attention.

  Whether this positive review buzz translates to strong sales remains to be seen. Nintendo, for its part, appears to be aware of the niche appeal of visual novels, which is why it went through the effort of making not one but three
  <em>
   Emio – The Smiling Man
  </em>
  demos, which have later been combined into a single trial version of the game that is now available on the eShop. The three-part demo encompasses the visual novel's prologue and first three chapters, thus offering a fairly comprehensive preview of the game. For reference,
  <em>
   Emio – The Smiling Man
  </em>
  has 12 chapters in total, which take just as many hours to complete on average, according to crowdsourced data compiled by HowLongToBeat.

  While
  <em>
   Emio – The Smiling Man
  </em>
  is currently the third highest-rated Switch-only game of 2024, it may not retain its spot by year's end. A few big Switch exclusives are still slated for release in the final third of 2024, starting with
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  on September 26.

 <p>
  The new
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game will then be followed by
  <em>
   Super Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mario and Luigi: Brothership
  </em>
  , which are scheduled to debut on October 17 and November 7, respectively. Given Nintendo's track record, all of these upcoming titles have the potential to score even better than
  <em>
   Emio – The Smiling Man
  </em>
  , especially considering their comparatively broader mainstream appeal.

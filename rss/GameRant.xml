  <em>
   Souls Tycoon
  </em>
  is a multi-genre game that combines a beloved adventure RPG and a business simulator, which is not often found in other
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences. Here, you will need to develop your production factory, as well as run around the open world to collect resources and level up.

  As with all tycoon simulations, the hardest part of
  <em>
   Souls Tycoon
  </em>
  is the beginning because you have almost no money and production is almost unprofitable. But by redeeming
  <em>
   Souls Tycoon
  </em>
  codes, you can change this in seconds, as you can automate your production and significantly increase your income with the rewards you receive.

  As with most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, redeeming
  <em>
   Souls Tycoon
  </em>
  codes won't take long, especially if you've done it before. If not, and you have no idea how it works, here's a step-by-step guide:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":188} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Souls Tycoon
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the bottom-left corner of the screen. There will be a button with a gear icon. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the settings menu. Here, scroll to the very bottom until you find the redemption section.
  </li>
  <li>
   The redemption section will contain an input field and a green Redeem button next to it. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lastly, click on the green Redeem button to submit your reward request.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, you will not see any notifications, but the rewards will be credited to your account.

      <title>Palworld's Most Exciting December 2024 Update Addition is Already Clear</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/palworlds-december-2024-update-island-size-biome-diversity-good-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The one thing to admire about Pocketpair is that the developer continues to put in the time and effort to grow its creation,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While still in early access, the game already has so much content that will keep players busy for hours on end, and it's still receiving more. The latest plans by the developer involve an announcement stating that
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  will be getting a major update this December, with a new and huge island making its way into the game. Though there is no further information other than that, one other detail about the announcement seems to guarantee a particular addition.

 <p>
  The official
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  X account posted that fans should be looking forward to a major update coming around December. The only details about the content to be provided are that a new island six times the size of that of Sakurajima will be making its way into the game. However, the post also contained screenshots, ones that show new environments. The update will likely involve multiple biomes set on the new island, giving players more places to enjoy and traverse. Although there is no confirmation, it is likely the direction that Pocketpair is taking with the upcoming patch.

 <p>
  There are many beautiful locations in
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , and it looks as if the December update plans to add a few more. Although Pocketpair's announcement contains a preview of the potential new biomes, there is no guarantee that they will all make it once the patch is released. Still, there's a possibility that all the pictures showcasing several new environments could make their way into the game, leaving expectations for things like:
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":251} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   A new cave biome that's centralized around crystals and their natural formation, with the possibility of them being more than just for aesthetic purposes
  </li>
  <li>
   A new forest biome with plants and trees having golden leaves, potentially meaning that the new island is centered around the theme of autumn
  </li>
  <li>
   A new mountain biome that could require players to take advantage of flying Pals to be properly explored
  </li>
  <li>
   A new underground biome, which could lead to the island introducing a new form of exploration
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  With the new area expected to be six times bigger than the game's Japanese-inspired Sakurajima island, having multiple biomes within it would be perfectly reasonable. Whether it's the ones seen in the announcement post or not, there is definitely anticipation for the update's arrival, as players will want to see what Pocketpair has decided to put into
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  for them to explore.

  What the New Island’s Biomes Could Mean for Palworld
 </h3>
 <p>
  Besides more areas to explore, the new biomes could lead to the addition of interesting content. For instance, it could mean they'll have undiscovered Pals in them, allowing for more things to capture or take down and having them potentially change the meta to keep the combat experience fresh. The new biomes could also mean some gameplay additions that may change some of the rules of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  . An example would be underground locations that contain valuable resources, but can only be accessed if players have the necessary Pals. The new island brings these possibilities to light, and Pocketpair likely had stuff like that in mind when designing them.

 <p>
  As Pocketpair looks to expand the
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  IP, the developer must improve the game and gather the needed attention for possible partnerships and collaborations. The upcoming December update is a good way in that direction, as the new island and its biomes will likely enhance the game's quality and make it more popular, thus helping it guarantee more future success.

     <li>
      Resident Evil games excel at immersion through graphics, audio, and lighting.

 <p>
  Creating a strong sense of immersion in a horror game is important to help make players feel as if they are there living the nightmare for real. As a result, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has always done an admirable job at sucking players into the experience through the use of graphical quality, audio design, and many more clever techniques that come together to produce an eerily realistic experience.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While not every game in the franchise has succeeded in achieving this, it's become clear that when Capcom wants to create an immersive horror experience, they are more than capable of doing so. When it comes to
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  specifically, though, these entries do the best job at immersing the player into their scenarios.

 <p>
  Though
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  had allowed players to explore Raccoon City,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Code: Veronica
   </strong>
  </em>
  drops them in an entirely new environment: Rockfort Island. Because of how much backtracking is involved in the game, it means that players will become very accustomed to the island, and since it's made up of so many different departments, such as the palace, barracks, and private residence, it feels less like a video game hub world and more like an actual locale that could exist in real life.

 <p>
  Another way Capcom made
  <em>
   Code: Veronica
  </em>
  immersive was through the use of lighting and how Claire's pocket lighter would create shadows of the people and objects around her. This may seem like a small touch, but it's important to preface that barely any games were doing this in the early 2000s, and it added a lot to the realism of
  <em>
   Code: Veronica
  </em>
  's gameplay as a result.

  Though the remake of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4

  is still split up into chapters, making the village, castle, and island their own open-hubs, it avoids the immersion-breaking loading screens that appeared in the original. Another way the remake improves in this area is the enemies. In the original
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , enemies would follow specific attack patterns and would always react in a specific way when being shot in the head, leg, or arm.

Since players will need to be strategic about where they place Rebecca and Billy, it means that they always need to be aware of their surroundings and focused on the game at all times, since being too inconsiderate can easily get one or the other killed.

 <p>
  This level of immersion is only enhanced by the fact the game ditches item boxes altogether, meaning players can drop items on the floor to come back for later if they need to. Not all fans were happy with these alterations to the classic formula, but if anything, they do an excellent job at engrossing players into Rebecca and Billy's journey by encouraging them to be more attentive to the game and the areas they explore.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  took what made the original so special and remodeled it with a new coat of paint to create a title that is a masterclass in immersion. Once players arrive in the Spencer Mansion and are given control of their character, all they can hear is the faint wind whistling through the windows, alongside the eerie ticking clock from one of the rooms. The lack of music makes the mansion itself feel like a creepy abandoned building that also looks astonishingly real from a visual standpoint.

 <p>
  While the door loading screens can seem a little outdated to some nowadays, they also go a long way in setting out an immersive atmosphere, forcing players to move around each area methodically rather than running and gunning. It also needs to be mentioned that the game features some outstanding lighting effects, with candles and lightning strikes shining up each room to add even more realism to the Spencer Mansion as an area.

  When it comes to ramping up immersion in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, the first person view has truly done wonders for this franchise, as perfectly demonstrated in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Village
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Despite
  <em>
   Village
  </em>
  leaning heavily into its storybook-like aesthetic, the first person camera angle paired with the lack of music and 3D audio still manage to make each and every area Ethan visits feel like real places.

 <p>
  <em>

  also dials down the HUD to avoid breaking the player's immersion, and tutorials are virtually non-existent. To become fully engrossed in Ethan's second horrific adventure, players should throw a pair of headphones on and turn on the HDR to experience the game in all its horrific beauty.

  One way Capcom succeeded in making the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
   Remake
  </strong>
  a horrific yet also utterly immersive experience was by making the zombies scary again. These might just be the most realistic zombies ever seen in a game, slowly shuffling around the narrow corridors of the RPD and only lunging towards the player if they end up getting too close.

 <p>
  Pair this with an amazing use of darkness and the vivid screams and howls from the zombies as they bash through the doors, and there's no wonder why
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  is considered such a scary entry in the franchise. All of this is taken to a whole new level once Mr. X enters the fray, where players will be able to hear his boots stomping on the ground from afar thanks to the impressive audio design, which is used to great effect here.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 7

  was a turning point for the franchise in more ways than one. Not only did it introduce a first-person view, allowing players to get up close and personal with the Baker family and their mold-infested estate, but it also marked the debut of the RE engine, which drastically improved the graphics. What results is a horrific adventure that immerses players into the experience from the moment they leave Ethan's car and step foot into the Baker's household.

 <p>
  While the impressive graphics allow players to feel as though they are right there with Ethan on his journey to rescue Mia, what also makes
  <em>

  feel so real is the amount of attention to detail featured throughout the experience. Whether it's the small indications of decay in each of the rooms or even the sound cues that ring off every now and again to remind players that they are being followed, it all comes together to create one of the most immersive horror games ever made.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  has added the Big Flake wrap to the in-game Item Shop for the third time since its release nearly five years ago.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is a free-to-play game, which means players can get a full experience without spending a single dime on it. However, gamers can buy the in-game currency in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and acquire cosmetic items for their character to wear in any game mode. While at first the Item Shop only featured a handful of items for gamers interested in exchanging V-Bucks for cosmetics, it is now several pages long and usually contains more than 50 items at a time.

 <p>
  Since the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Pass was exclusive up until recently and gamers knew it included items that would never return to the game, rarity has always been a big deal for many fans. As more and more cosmetics were released over the years - even in the Item Shop - some went up in rarity, which made them more coveted by players, even if they didn't particularly notice them when they first released.

 <p>
  This is exactly what happened with the Big Flake wrap. It was originally released on December 6, 2019, coinciding with the Chapter 2 Season 1 Winterfest event, but at the time, no one paid much attention to it. It came back once in March 2020 and was never seen again until the Item Shop refreshed at 12 AM GMT on December 6, 2024 (1,725 days later). It'll be in the Item Shop for a total of 48 hours, giving players who want to get it before it leaves the Item Shop again a decent window of time to buy it. The rare wrap came back as part of a content creator Item Shop bundle, Zelfy's Locker Bundle, which is available until December 8 at 12 AM ET.

  As the years passed, this wrap's rarity slowly went up, which made those who bought it at the time happy to have done so, as it increased the value of their account. Players who were waiting for it to return are celebrating because they have the opportunity to buy it at last. However, players who were pleased to know that they had a rare item in their
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  inventory don't feel the same way at all.

  Thankfully, fans can now purchase
  <em>

  cosmetics through the web version of the Item Shop. So, those who aren't able to access their preferred platform for
  <em>

  </em>
  during this time can simply buy the Big Flake wrap remotely from their browser.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Days Gone
   </strong>
  </em>
  writer and director John Garvin has complained about PlayStation's 30th anniversary celebration video leaving out games developed by Bend Studio. The recently-released video is just over two minutes long and pays tribute to several PlayStation characters and franchises, including some from third-party developers, but Bend Studio games like
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  were oddly overlooked.

 <p>
  Despite facing a myriad of technical issues and lukewarm critical reception at launch,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  carved out a sizable fanbase for itself in the five years it's been on the market. However, reports of internal turbulence at Bend Studio ultimately led to the cancelation of a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel a few years ago, and the team is currently focussing its efforts on a brand-new IP.
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  fans continue to rally for the shelved sequel to this day, and director John Garvin, who exited Bend Studio in 2020, apparently isn't very happy with the cancelation either.

 <p>
  Garvin has attracted notoriety in recent years for his somewhat displeased stance against Sony, with the
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  director even lambasting an Astro Bot cameo of Deacon St. John, the protagonist of
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  . Now, Garvin has yet again taken to social media to express discontentment over the absence of Bend Studio's contributions in PlayStation's 30th anniversary tribute video. In a recent post uploaded to Twitter, Garvin parodied the trailer's numerous "It's About..." taglines with an "It's about...ignoring Bend Studio" remark.

  The former Bend Studio director then said that the 30th anniversary trailer makes
  <strong>
   no acknowledgment of
   <em>
    Syphon Filter
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Days Gone
   </em>
  </strong>
  , making it seem as if they "never happened." The omission of Bend Studio's two most prominent franchises is quite bizarre, especially since the team has been under Sony's ownership for decades. The
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  franchise may have been dormant for a long time, but so have
  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Twisted Metal
  </em>
  , and they were all featured in the trailer. Therefore,
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  could've slotted in with these legacy PlayStation franchises and honored Bend Studio in the process.

 <p>
  On the other hand, both Sony and Bend Studio have somewhat distanced themselves from
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  and John Garvin in recent years, so the game's exclusion from the trailer might be a result of that decision. Still,
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  was deserving of consideration at the very least for a spot in PlayStation's 30th anniversary festivities, and the reasons behind its omission may never be known.

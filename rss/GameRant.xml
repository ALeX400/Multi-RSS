  <strong>
   <em>
    Beyond Good and Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still in development, Ubisoft said. This confirmation was offered as part of a more comprehensive info dump that saw the company clarify some details about the upcoming re-release of the original game, which is also meant to serve as a prelude to
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  .

  The sequel-prequel to the cult-classic 2003 game was first teased in 2008 and waited nine years for a cinematic reveal, which debuted at E3 2017. While even some
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  developers reportedly expected the game to be canceled by now, Ubisoft Montpellier kept pursuing the project over the years. That endeavor hit another unexpected roadblock in July 2023, after creative director Emile Morel suddenly passed away at only 40 years of age.

  Fans Rejoice Over Confirmation That Beyond Good and Evil 2 Is Still in Development
 </h2>
 <p>
  Taking to Twitter on June 24, Ubisoft has once again reaffirmed that
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  remains in development. While the company did not elaborate on the current state of the project, this simple update was enough to lift the spirits of many a fan, prompting a sizable outburst of online positivity. The tweet itself was viewed over 140,000 times within 90 minutes of going live, thus also helping to highlight some new information about the recently announced
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Specifically, Ubisoft has revealed that the upcoming re-release will be available on Steam from day one. This confirmation should alleviate some of the fandom's availability concerns stemming from the company's recent decision to delist
  <em>
   Beyond
  </em>
  <em>
   Good and Evil
  </em>
  from Steam. And while the publisher hasn't given any indication that it plans to revert that decision, it did reassure fans that the original game will remain available via Ubisoft+, Ubisoft Store, and GOG.

  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  is scheduled to debut on Tuesday, June 25. The game will be the first Ubisoft-developed title not to skip Steam on day one in half a decade, thus marking an important turning point in the company's digital distribution strategy.
  <em>
   The Rogue Prince of Persia
  </em>
  already signaled this pivot when it launched exclusively on Steam in late May 2024, although that early-access title is only published by Ubisoft, whereas its development is handled by Evil Empire.

  While
  <em>

  is still without a release window, the new version of the original game will be looking to make the wait a bit easier with some unique content. Specifically, Ubisoft has confirmed that
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  will feature a bonus mission meant to bridge the gap between the two games. The mission will let fans "discover more about Jade's past," which is also the general idea behind the long-awaited sequel that has long been confirmed to be a prequel.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
   </em>
  </strong>
  has taken great strides in improving on the original's experience, a feat that blends into its plot and side quests alike. With a clearer focus on its characters' differing ideologies bearing more weight to the game's story,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  's side quests do a great job of highlighting the choices that the player can make in the moral ambiguity between law and chaos. Both sides clearly have pros and cons, and the ways that the Nahobino interacts with the demons around Da'at plays a vital hand in this, made more compelling through the conversations that Yoko and Tao have upon side quest completion.

  The first half of
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  's new story mode, Canon of Vengeance, bears resemblance to the original's own beginning narrative, though there are a surprising number of enhancements to both its plot and side quests. For starters, having newcomer Yoko Hiromine alongside Tao Isonokami as guest party members for a time lets them be better woven into the choices highlighted to the player. Much of Yoko's character centers around the idea of revenge, as she becomes the primary chaos representative that skews away from Tao's more neutral stance on the state of the world. Though the two are able to see each other's views, their debriefs after the Nahobino's decisions in side quests present this dichotomy in a way that shows there's no right or wrong answer.

  Giving Demons Personality
 </h3>
 <p>
  Some of these discussions are woven into repeated side quests from the original
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5
  </em>
  , showing efforts made to better highlight the spectrum of law, neutrality, and chaos in regard to its demons. These side quests do a fantastic job of demonstrating the capacity for good and evil in the angels and demons alike; some of the new quests in
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  can be quite endearing, presenting a playful side to the demons that take into account their lore and personality.

 <p>
  One example is the demon Amabie, whose desire for fame and entertainment has the Nahobino help a group of demons in the netherworld put on a show of music and dance. Amabie's presence in
  <em>

  's Tokyo while the Qadistu leave its inhabitants sick, however, goes deeper when considering its folklore of prophesying an epidemic.

  Extending Past Side Quests
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the case of returning side quests, one from the Minato region of Da'at has the Nahobino face off against an Oni whose misguided desire to be a bodyguard to weaker demons has him feared due to his demanding nature. Though the Oni's side quest ends with him retreating back into his cave alone,
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  adds a new quest that ties into the demon's storyline, making for a happier ending.

 <p>
  "Home Sweet Home" sees the Nahobino come across a flock of Halphas, bird-like demons struggling under the desert heat of Da'at, who ask for help in finding a place of refuge and a bodyguard to keep them safe. Though the Oni is at first resigned to being alone, the demon eventually comes around, as the family of Halphas move into the cave with him to keep each other company.

 <h3 id="rewarding-the-player-in-many-ways">
  Rewarding the Player in Many Ways
 </h3>
 <p>
  The side quests in
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  often yield rewards beyond just their narratives, however, granting the Nahobino items, Macca, and the occasional Periapt, allowing for incredible Magatsuhi skills that can turn the tides of combat. There are even side quests that give a great deal of lore to the player, as is the case with a Bethel researcher in Tokyo studying the art of essences. Asking for the Nahobino to inherit the Mahama skill, the researcher will go on to explain the many Aogami-type essences that can be found across Da'at, discussing the differences between logistic, command, and combat types that help players better understand the turning point of
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  's story.

 <p>
  Lastly, the inclusion of demons and battles that were previously DLC add much to
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  's side quests, particularly in the Menorah fights. Facing off against iconic demons from
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne
  </em>
  , like the infamous Matador and the Four Horsemen, helps provide a wonderful challenge and a break from the standard encounters around Da'at. It's a fantastic way to tie in references to the series' past while having the content available from the get-go, cementing
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  's status as a truly definitive version.

  The sandy dunes of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  are no easy task for players to get by, thanks to the many hostile pals roaming the area and the unbearable heat. There are plenty of pals that will attack on sight, and most travel in groups of three or more. The same can be said for
  <strong>
   Dazemu
  </strong>
  , the mountable bird of the desert.

  Dazemu is a ground-type pal that resembles a combination of an emu and an ostrich. It has a red cape draped over its back and a royal-like headdress sitting atop its head, making Dazemu come off like a prince traveling the hot desert. Dazemu is believed to aid those who roam the desert and conquer their fears and doubts.

  Dazemu won't be impossible to spot as they are mostly found in the desert regions of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  . In order to get to the desert area quickly, it's suggested to take the
  <strong>
   Sealed Realm of the Winged Tyrant
  </strong>
  fast travel waypoint and head east or go to the
  <strong>
   Mount Flopie Summit
  </strong>
  waypoint and cross the waters. Once players have arrived, it's time to seek out Dazemu.

 <p>
  Dazemu can be seen walking around the desert in groups of three or more, and their red cape and headwear make it easy to find them amidst all the brown and yellow. Dazemu are not dangerous to players getting close, as they are more prone to run away and avoid confrontation.

 <p>
  Once provoked, either through an attack or a capture attempt, the multiple Dazemu will team up and begin their assault on the player. Since they are ground-type pals, bringing along a grass-type pal is best to take advantage of the element type and turn the tables against the Dazemu.

     Since Dazemu are found in the desert region, bring armor and undershirts to combat the heat. Dazemu are asleep at nighttime, and the weather conditions are less harsh, making it the best time to attempt to catch these birds. Once the sun rises, so does the heat and the risk of taking damage.

  Dazemu aren't remarkable in any combat scenario, as they don't possess any semblance of powerful moves, nor are they able to take much damage before passing out. For weaker pals that have a disadvantage to ground moves, Dazemu is capable of swooping in for a quick kill before exiting the area.

 <p>
  Back at the base, Dazemu has a suitable level 2 gathering work suitability. This isn't ideal, as players will have many pals with equivalent gathering skills that also come packed with other abilities, forcing Dazemu to the sidelines indefinitely. In a pinch, Dazemu is a decent option to keep the surrounding area clean.

  Fortunately, Dazemu's partner skill,

   Sand Sprint

  , has plenty of utility. Sand sprint is a mounting skill, allowing players to ride on the back of Dazemu and take advantage of its quick feet. When traveling the desert, Dazemu's partner skill allows it to run much faster compared to grassy areas, giving players an opportunity to get through the hot region faster than normal.

  Players who are trying to reach the Temple Town Ruins should begin at the Moorth Ruins Site of Grace in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Scadu Altus. From there, fans should travel northeast to pass through a small pool of water and into a tunnel. After navigating through that tunnel, players should ride northwest through the swamp to reach Rauh Base. Here, players will find the Ancient Ruins Base Site of Grace, and they can ride southwest from that location to reach Temple Town Ruins.

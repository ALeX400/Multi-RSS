  In the Will of the Mysterious Graffiti Quest in

   <em>
    Genshin Impact

  , Travelers will help return the corroded power to the realm of night. The Quest begins by sitting on the purple chair, situated east of the Masters of the Night-Wind Tribe, where a Graffiti Raven will instruct players on what to do.

  Unlike typical Quests, the
  <strong>
   Will of the Mysterious Graffiti
  </strong>
  will not automatically grant players
  <strong>
   The Finishing Touch?
  </strong>
  Achievement in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . Instead, players must complete the hidden tasks and then return to acquire the trophy along with a Luxurious chest.

   With the game being so complete and complex, there are virtually infinite ways to play it. Players can either take a perfectionist approach and decide to loot every dead body they drop and explore every corner of the Wild West, or jump straight into the action and feel the rush of a shootout.

 <p>
  The Dead Eye mechanic in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is absolutely outstanding, as it not only allows players to gain more control over a situation, even when they're outnumbered, but it also makes for an amazingly cinematic scene that culminates with various enemies falling lifeless to the ground. That said, while Dead Eye is a great advantage to have, some players don't make the most out of it, as they often shoot their foes in the shoulder or the leg, which rarely ever represents an immediate kill.

 <p>
  Players should focus on aiming for the head so that every bullet they fire is a guaranteed kill, making everything a lot simpler, and leaving no enemies alive to fire back at them.

  Given the sheer number of things players can accomplish in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , it's easy to see why a lot of people can miss out on the treasure maps and the secrets that they lead them toward. The world is beautiful, but it's also overwhelmingly massive to the point where some people may find it a challenge to figure out the visual clues present in these sketched treasure maps.

 <p>
  In such an event, there's no shame in finding a guide to save time and quickly locate the treasure in question. It's a valuable

   tip

  to ensure that players don't feel like they're constantly strapped for cash. Most treasure hordes provide enough gold bars to ensure that Arthur will be set up for quite some time, preventing players from feeling like they're lacking money in any given scenario.

  The immersive qualities of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  can't be stated enough. The world is drop-dead gorgeous and does a great job of letting players feel like they're in the Wild West as they summon their trusty steed and gallop across the countryside, enjoying the beautiful views along the way. However, as beautiful as this game may be, there are some instances when the HUD can feel overbearing and take players out of what should be a nigh-perfect experience.
 </p>

 <p>
  This can be curbed with the various in-game settings that let players customize the HUD to their hearts' content. Everything from the mini-map to Arthur's stats can be tweaked to make them situational, ensuring that players can only see these aspects of the heads-up display when required. It's a simple but valuable

  One of the many things players love about
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is Arthur's amazing beard and how it grows naturally as many days pass in-game. His beard can become as bushy as can be, but this growth stops after a point. This can be disappointing, but there's a simple way to ensure that Arthur can look grizzlier than ever if players want his beard to grow even more.

 <p>
  All players need to do is find some beard tonic and apply it to enhance Arthur's beard. It's a simple
  <strong>
   <em>

   tip
  </strong>
  that's perfect for players who want their version of Arthur to exude potent dad energy and look intimidating as he guns down enemies by the hundreds with a cold look on his face.

  There's a reason why people love mods for their favorite video games, and it's only a given that the modding community for one of the most popular video games ever made would have many dedicated fans either fixing tiny things or adding brand-new experiences for others to enjoy. As long as players don't mind getting a bit technical, they can have a great time modding
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  to their heart's content.

 <p>
  From small mods that improve the way Arthur controls to massive tweaks that change the way players approach a game, it's easy to see why
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  has become a hotbed of modding like nothing before it. Players who love
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  but can't ignore some of its minute yet annoying faults can use mods to remove most of these frustrations and make the game as engaging as possible in just a few minutes.

 <p>
  In terms of graphics, it's also possible to improve the game in various ways. While
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  already looks amazing, there are some small tweaks here and there that players can try to make the game even more visually stunning. This, unfortunately, won't be possible for all PC players, as the title is already demanding to run without extra visual improvements. So, if players want to play in 4K with the mods available and run it at 60 FPS or more, they'll have to either stick to DLSS Performance mode and lose some sharpness, or have a very powerful system with an RTX 4090 GPU to take the load.

  When
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  was released on next-gen consoles, fans were amazed to see just how robust Rockstar's engine was. The fact that the entire game could be played in first-person was truly mind-blowing, and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  lets players enjoy this feature, too.

  The over-the-shoulder camera will never grow old, but players who've sunk in a lot of hours and don't mind switching things up a bit will find first-person mode to be a fresh change of pace. Even now, it's hard to believe that the entire game can be experienced from a completely different viewpoint.

 <p>
  Granted, being aware of Arthur's surroundings, taking cover, and even firing and aiming a weapon properly can be more difficult from a first-person perspective, and this has been the case since
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  . However, while this viewpoint takes away from some of the experience, it also adds a layer of realism that allows players to feel like they're the ones shooting at O'Driscoll gang members.

 <p>
  There are many populated settlements in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  that players can explore, with Saint Denis being a pretty obvious example. While the game doesn't restrict Arthur from using a horse in these areas, that doesn't mean that players should recklessly gallop through them.

 <p>
  Running into a pedestrian with Arthur's horse can lead to them getting hurt, which unnecessarily adds to Arthur's bounty. Players will eventually have enough money to turn this into a non-issue, but the trek to remove this bounty in the first place is grating and better off avoided, especially for such a silly offense.

 <p>
  Some players may feel that the process of earning money in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  can be a bit too cumbersome early on. The economy seems particularly stingy, even with the valuation of currency at the time.

  However, there is no need to stress out about money for too long. There are a ton of ways to earn the big bucks in the campaign, and players who reach the mid-game will be drowning in cash after a point.

  While the more obscure parts of this world can still be overlooked if someone is feeling overwhelmed, it is still recommended to engage with every Stranger side mission present in the game. These side stories have a ton of work and attention put into them, introducing new characters while exploring the personalities of established ones as well.

 <p>
  The world of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is huge, and trying to explore the whole map on foot is a huge mistake that will suck out all the joy from this game in no time flat. So, it's important to tame a trusty steed that players can explore the lands on.

 <p>
  That being said, simply galloping across the countryside with a horse isn't enough to gain the mount's trust. Arthur also needs to groom and feed the horse at regular intervals while not pushing it too hard for too long. Doing so ensures that players will be able to bond with their horses quickly and maximize the fun of horseback riding.

  Hunting is one of the most crucial tasks that players will carry out time and time again in
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  . It's a great way to gain money, and it also gives players a chance to try something different if they are growing tired of the main story.

 <p>
  Players may find aiming while hunting to be slightly tough, especially given how tense these situations can be. To counteract this, the process can be automated via Dead Eye. It's a simple
  <em>
   <strong>
    RDR2
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
   tip
  </strong>
  , but the sheer number of successful hunts enabled with Dead Eye speaks for itself.

  Speaking of Dead Eye, players should always try and maximize this move during combat. Initially, Dead Eye may seem weak, but its full potential is unlocked after going through a substantial portion of the main story.

  Players should keep a lot of tobacco on hand since it allows them to restore their Dead Eye whenever Arthur runs out of it. Not only do firefights become more cinematic with this combat feature, but it also allows players to maximize the time they spend out of cover, too.

  The Arabian horse is the best mount in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . While buying it from a stable can be a rather taxing endeavor, players can also get a beautiful white-coated Arabian near Lake Isabella in the northwestern corner of the map.

  When players put on a marker in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , there's a trick that allows them to reach its location without any input. Players can start riding the horse on the path and turn on cinematic mode, allowing them to leave the controller as the horse travels at its own pace.

 <p>
  Of course, players need to be wary of any sounds occurring near them, since they could signify the beginning of an event. Being aware of these occurrences will help players experience the best of both worlds in

  has its fair share of fast travel options, along with a free one that can be unlocked within the camp itself. Players need to reach Chapter 2 and accumulate $545 before the Fast Travel map becomes accessible, but getting access to it is more than worth the effort required.

  As Arthur starts committing crimes and getting noticed by the lawmen, he will start accruing a bounty. A small bounty can be tedious at times, but a high bounty will make Arthur the target of anyone with a gun desperate for some cash.

 <p>
  Even though money might be tight in the beginning, it’s often in the player's best interest to routinely pay off their bounty by heading to the local post office. In the long run, this will be much more beneficial and cost-effective, as players won't burn through nearly as much ammo defending themselves from bounty hunters and law enforcement.

 <p>
  One thing Arthur can do to avoid accruing as much of a bounty in the first place is to wear a disguise. Wearing a simple bandana or a mask during a crime will make it harder for people to recognize Arthur and minimize how much of a bounty he accrues.

 <p>
  Eventually, players will want to have an outfit that they only wear during crimes to completely avoid detection and drawing suspicion to themselves. The outfit might be expensive at first, but it will allow an outlaw to save a ton of money that would have otherwise been wasted paying off bounties.

  There are many ways to make money in

  , starting out with crops to sow and harvest for some pretty good profit. However, once there's a good flow of income on the farm, it may be time to start looking into Production Chains.

  Production Chains are how players can make various processed goods and sell them to companies around town. They can be expensive to start up, but their income potential is substantial, and it's definitely worth investing in them. There are a total of 15 possible Production Chains, so, of course, many players are wondering which ones are the best to invest in.

  The Cement Factory is a great way to get rid of the stone collected while completing rock removal contracts, which is something most players start doing at the beginning of the game. As such, rocks can get collected fairly quickly, and they don't have much use outside of this Production Chain. It lets you make cement bricks, bags, roof plates, and more unique items that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.

 <p>
  There are some problems with investing in the Cement Factory, however, because it's not as diverse as the other Production Chains. There's also an expensive asking price to buy it at $370,000, which is one of the most expensive on the list. Despite these issues, it remains a nice Chain to invest in to ensure that something that's essentially waste can be turned into profit.

 <p>
  Investing in the Oil Mill largely depends on what kind of crops players choose to focus on in
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  , but especially if the focus is oil-seed crops like olives and sunflowers, then the Oil Mill is one of the best Production Chains to invest in. Canola is an easy crop to plant, take care of, and harvest, and some fantastic profits can be made by investing in the Chain. It costs $240,000 to start up, so it's one of the cheaper ones as well.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1153} -->

 <p>
  However, it's worth noting that crops like Olives can require quite a lot of investment themselves to grow, so this is definitely a Chain to invest in the later stages of the game. It's still a fantastic choice, though, because of its diversity, fairly low initial investment, and quick turnaround time for products each month.

 <p>
  The Sawmill is a fantastic Production Chain because of its potential to create multiple income streams. Wood is the only thing needed for it, and the resulting products can be used to create even more at the Cooper and Carpentry Chains. As such, it not only creates its own income stream, but has great synergy with other Chains. This means creating multiple stable income streams becomes a lot easier when investing in a Sawmill.

 <p>
  Additionally, it offers a nice change from the sow and harvest gameplay. It's a break from that loop, and it's nice to have a second interest for profit generation. Quite a lot of equipment is needed to get started alongside an additional $300,000 for the initial investment in the Chain, but despite the high cost to get it going, it's worth it in the long run.

  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  introduced a range of new crops to plant, and among them are Peas and Spinach. The Canning Factory is not only a great use for these new crops that most players would want to experiment with, but just a generally good Production Chain to invest in because of the immense diversity it offers. Pretty much any vegetable can be used in the Cannery to create a wide range of recipes, making this Chain a good choice for players who like to purely focus on farming.

 <p>
  Many of the vegetables that are used in the Canning Factory are also some of the most profitable in the game, which means that it has the same advantage as the Bakery in doubling profit from crops that already sell very well. The initial investment for the Canning Factory is quite hefty at $330,000, but it'll be easy to make that money back once it gets going.

  Having a Bakery is by far the best Production Chains in
  <em>

  , because it makes use of simple crops to create a fantastic income stream. Wheat and Rice are needed to start making money, and these are two of the most accessible crops in the game to plant and harvest. Both also have a high yield, which means that they can easily be sold normally and still have leftovers for the Bakery to double the profits with Bread sales.

  The Bakery is also the cheapest Production Chain to invest in, at $150,000. This means it can be built and start running fairly early on in the game, and alongside the easy-planting crops it needs to function, it becomes a continuous stream of income for the rest of the game. Plus, once it generates enough raw material, you can start making cakes for even more profit.

  <strong>
   Shlooter
  </strong>
  " was coined by Giant Bomb's Alex Navarro and combines "looter shooter" into one glorious Frankenstein phrase. With the subgenre's most well-known franchise releasing its third entry recently, this seems like a perfect time to take a look at the best looter shooters on the market.

  As a concept, looter shooter is still in its infancy in the grand scheme of things. Consequently, the genre's defining traits are somewhat flexible, as there isn't an authority on what constitutes a looter shooter. In general, representatives tend to be first-person or third-person shooters with progression tied to obtaining better guns (or weapons). While isometric action RPGs like
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  share many traits in common with looter shooters, ranged combat is not encouraged above simply taking a hammer and whacking away at the enemy. The same can be said about
  <em>
   Monster Hunter: World
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   <strong>
    Looter shooter games
   </strong>
   are incredibly rare, with most years maybe producing one or two entries that 100% qualify. 2024 has been pretty light in this area, but things might improve with the eventual release of Reality Core, Dustland, and (most importantly) Borderlands 4. In the meantime, a section dedicated to similar games that do not 100% fit the genre has been added.

  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  had negative momentum before its debut and still struggled to meet expectations. Sharing very little in common with the games that put the series on the map, Rocksteady's polarizing
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  entry leans into live-service conventions and loot grinding, with the playable anti-heroes/villains all utilizing guns as their main offensive option. This decision was likely made to facilitate the endgame loop, which sees players working their way through masteries to collect better sets of weapons and items. Somewhat similar to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , the loot comes with randomized modifiers and tier levels, with random drops being the name of the game.

  Look,
  <em>
   Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  was put through the wringer when it launched in February 2024, receiving such a thorough beating that tossing any further criticism feels like overkill at this point. Therefore, let's focus on the positives and highlight a few elements that might make Rocksteady's title a decent option as a
  <strong>
   looter shooter game
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Most importantly of all, the gameplay is, honestly, pretty fun in short bursts. Despite using the same weapons, each character has unique traversal mechanics that reflect their source material and have a steep enough learning curve to provide some sense of progression and mastery. The story is dumb but has a few entertaining moments, and the Suicide Squad's members are generally amusing. The loot drops at a pretty consistent pace during both the story and endgame, and the weapons might hit the mark with people who mostly enjoy stats.

  Despite being around for nearly two decades by this point, the looter shooter genre still seems pretty young due to releases being relatively rare. Honestly, more Soulslike games have probably come out in the last year than looter shooters in the last five. Consequently, there is still room for innovation and growth, with the concept yet to become exhausted.
  <em>
   Vigor
  </em>
  serves as one ambitious attempt to shake up the formula by incorporating ideas from a few other genres: survival, crafting, and battle royales.

  Basically, players have a house they must gradually update, a process that generally requires entering an area to scavenge resources. These matches bring together up to 16 players, all of whom will be carrying weapons, ammo, and armor. If they are killed, they can be looted, which creates a very intense atmosphere. However, the goal is not to kill everyone but rather to transport loot back to a safe house, creating a satisfying risk/reward system.

  The endgame largely revolves around grinding loot to craft more powerful builds, but
  <em>
   Outriders

  is a bit too stingy with its drops, so the experience tends to be slow and annoying rather than rewarding. When focusing just on the campaign, this game becomes an enjoyable, albeit unspectacular looter shooter.

  Flying Wild Hog went in a completely different direction with its sequel to 2013's decent
  <em>
   Shadow Warrior
  </em>
  . Rather than a series of levels set within somewhat spacious maps,
  <em>
   Shadow Warrior 2
  </em>
  drops Lo Wang in a hub area that can then be used to undergo a vast range of missions, with only some being directly related to the main story.

  With over 70 weapons available in the game, including everything from katanas to rocket launchers,
  <em>
   Shadow Warrior 2
  </em>
  definitely ticks the boxes of a looter shooter. As a homage to old-school shooters from the '90s, just with a heavier focus on loot,
  <em>
   Shadow Warrior 2
  </em>
  is pretty decent.

  <strong>
   Looter shooter games
  </strong>
  are already rare, and free-to-play entries are almost unheard of. For the longest time,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  seemed to be the only real option, especially since
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's free mode is too restrictive to truly qualify. However, in July 2024, a new competitor joined the field:
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  . Nexon's ambitious Unreal Engine 5 game launched to a fairly mixed reception, and that reputation has not improved much since then. While the visuals and combat are both pretty darn good, the story, playable characters, and loot tend to be more polarizing. Nevertheless, anyone craving a third-person shooter with large-scale battles, co-op, and an open-world should check out this release, and they have little to lose besides time.

 <p>
  When it comes to loot,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  floods players with weapons and reactors, along with farming parts to unlock new descendants. The loot system is more cumbersome than it needs to be, mostly due to a cluttered UI that overcomplicates the simplest of processes. When it comes to the actual weapon drops, most of the "normal" options are randomized, sort of similar to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  . However, the game also has fixed Ultimates that are the best of the best, although these take quite a lot of work to unlock.

  Generally speaking, isometric RPGs were ignored for this article, as most cannot truly be classified as shooters.
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  is a noteworthy exception though, as it is all about guns. The twin-stick shooter is set in an alternate reality where aliens have invaded most of Earth, leaving four soldiers to battle through hordes of no-good extraterrestrials.

  New weapons covering a wide array of rarities are obtained through random drops, with most weapons offering the possibility of installing an upgrade to increase a specific state (rate of fire, being an example). That said, the weapons themselves do not feel all that distinct.

 <p>
  A roguelite,
  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  challenges players to work their way through four zones, each consisting of a handful of random levels. En route, they pick a variety of weapons, which come with unique stats, elemental effects, and other variables. Toward the end of each level, players get to pick from three modifiers that will impact the rest of their run, most of which have multiple upgrades designed to encourage specific builds. Due to its nature,
  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  resets the player's weapons after death, so they will not be able to accumulate a fixed arsenal. However, as the game is a roguelite and not a roguelike, progression is made regardless of whether someone fails or succeeds. This largely comes in the form of
  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  's playable characters and upgrades for them, although weapons can also be unlocked.

  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  is a pick-up-and-play type game that is ideal for short sessions. While roguelikes can be frustrating due resetting progress, this release is designed to regularly reward players with progress, so it rarely feels like a run was just a waste of time. The gunplay is very smooth and responsive, and the weapons are quite creative and varied.

  <em>

  has come a long way since it entered early access in 2020. Compared to its early pre-launch state, which largely consisted of untapped potential, the roguelite gradually evolved into a highly entertaining first-person shooter, even if it is still somewhat rough around the edges. Nowadays, the game is officially out, and it delightfully blends accessible first-person action with roguelite elements.

  did not need to reinvent the wheel. By the end of its predecessor's run, the franchise was at a good place and the sequel only needed to focus on the elements that worked in

 <p>
  Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   The Divison 2
  </em>
  fared better with critics, as it essentially launched at a similar level to its predecessor's end state. The combat is improved due to the enemies no longer being as egregious of bullet sponges, while the loot system added a touch of variety without sacrificing the realism sought after by the franchise. Crucially,
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  launched with an endgame, which is rather important for a looter shooter's longevity. Nowadays, Ubisoft's game is overflowing with content and quality-of-life adjustments, and it is an easy recommendation for anyone searching for a third-person shooter they can sink months into.

  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  is a bit different from the typical looter shooter since drops contain randomized resources (and experience) rather than new weapons. These items can then be used to upgrade each class' equipment. While supporting solo play,
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  is at its best when played in co-op as players team up to take on a variety of missions in a decent range of biomes.

  The game's classes all come with unique strengths, weaknesses, and gameplay styles, ensuring that most people find someone to match their preferences.
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  has been around for a few years now, and it is now firmly established as a standout indie project that can deliver quantity and quality. The extraction-style gameplay is simple but always engaging, and this title is one of the better entry points into that subgenre.

  Unlike its predecessor,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  impressed critics right out of the gate, and most of its expansions largely served as improvements.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  showcases Bungie's expertise in the first-person shooter genre; in fact, an argument could be made that the multiplayer-focused game represents this gameplay style's peak alongside
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  . In terms of loot,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is packed to the brim with unlockables that encourage players to customize their characters and load-outs.

  A popular roguelike,
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2
  </em>
  has a simple but addictive formula: kill everything that moves. After selecting a Survivor, players spawn in a randomly generated level filled with enemies. Their goal is to reach an extraction point so they can move on to the next stage. While initially manageable, the game steadily raises the difficulty, to the point that players can quickly become overwhelmed if they fall behind in terms of equipment.

  In
  <em>

  is just fun to play, and the combat is elevated by stylish visuals.

  <em>

  initially garnered a lukewarm reception, which is not that surprising considering the game launched with repetitive gameplay that focused heavily on grinding the same few missions. However, over the last decade, Digital Extremes has gradually established the looter shooter as a cornerstone of the multiplayer scene.
  <em>
   Warframe

  has grown well beyond its original blueprint, even if its core gameplay is still relatively grind-heavy.

  How could anything other than
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  take the top spot? Gearbox's franchise might not have been the first looter shooter since
  <em>
   Hellgate: London
  </em>
  existed, but it defined the genre. While not every entry is a bona fide masterpiece,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has been fairly consistent over the years.
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  is generally considered to be the best in the series, although 2019's third entry improves upon its predecessor's gunplay by quite a considerable margin. That said,
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  's characters are rather obnoxious, which does hurt its story.
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is also an enjoyable spin-off inspired by tabletop RPGs.

  is the poster boy of

  Ultimately, there are not all that many looter shooters out there, at least not if the definition is kept relatively strict. While most of the genre's games are designed to keep people busy for the long haul, there could come a time when someone exhausts all of their options.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Far Cry 6
   </em>
   – Arguably the most polarizing mainline entry in Ubisoft's franchise,
   <em>
    Far Cry 6
   </em>
   swapped out the traditional skill progression system for a loot-based one. For the most part, this switch was not received well as it limits the player's potential for growth and is built on fairly inconsistent loot drops. Still, the core gunplay is very good and some of the weapons are a lot of fun. This entry is the closest
   <em>
    Far Cry
   </em>
   has come to being a looter shooter.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Hunt: Showdown 1986
   </em>
   – Honestly, this could qualify as a looter shooter, but the gameplay loop does not focus on acquiring better loot through drops. The goal is to defeat bosses, which generally rewards materials that can be used to acquire better equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
   – Gunfire's Soulslike seems to have all the makings of a looter shooter since players constantly pick up drops from enemies. However, weapons are rarely found through this method and usually need to be purchased. As such,
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
   does not quite scratch the same itch.

 <p>
  Players can send invitations to other players via the Guild menu in the Reputation section of the Pirate Log menu. However,
  <strong>
   players can only receive invitations from friends
  </strong>
  , so they have to make sure to add the Guild Leader. In the same menu, players can view their invitations and accept them to join the Guild. Once they're a part of the Guild, a Guild member can also pledge one or multiple ships if they want to.

  Apart from the social aspect that Guilds bring to the

   <em>

  Reaching Guild Reputation 15 unlocks the ability to become the Guild's Emissary. Players can
  <strong>
   head to the Souvereign's Hut and vote to become the Guild's Emissary
  </strong>
  . The Emissary system for Guilds works the same as for traditional Trading Companies and has its own Emissary Ledger with rewards.

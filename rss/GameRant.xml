      <title>Saber Interactive's Avatar: The Last Airbender Game is a Good Omen After Quest for Balance</title>

  Few shows are as defining as Nickelodeon's
  <em>
   <strong>

   </strong>
  </em>
  , with Aang's journey remaining as emotional as it is brilliant nearly twenty years after its inception. Despite strong beginnings, however, the
  <em>
   Avatar The Last Airbender
  </em>
  IP has seen an air of divisiveness in its resurgence, a feat none more prevalent than in
  <em>
   Avatar The Last Airbender: Quest for Balance
  </em>
  , the GameMill Entertainment title released just last year to less-than-stellar reviews. With efforts made by Avatar Studios to reignite the IP in a more positive lens, including a world concert tour and its continued set of
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  graphic novels, there remains hope that a video game set in its world will deliver on fan expectations.

  Saber Interactive intends to do just that, announcing a triple-A
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  RPG in development, working with the creative direction of the original show's creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, through its collaboration with Avatar Studios. According to a statement by Saber Interactive, efforts are being made toward the project balancing the new and familiar; following an Avatar set thousands of years in the past, the action-RPG intends to immerse players in a vibrant world and "unexplored era," moving backward as opposed to forward as
  <em>
   The Legend of Korra
  </em>
  show did in 2012. The premise certainly stands out, and with the project being a mix of Avatar Studios and Saber's efforts, whose impressive repertoire of games includes
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  and the upcoming
  <em>
   A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead
  </em>
  , the signs point to a good omen for the IP.

  The History of ATLA Licensed Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  IP has seen its fair share of games, from tabletops to browser games, collaborative and otherwise. Its console history, however, is a bit more outdated than one might expect. THQ saw the development of four
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  multi-platform titles between the mid-to-late 2000s, including
  <em>
   ATLA: The Video Game
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Into the Inferno
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Burning Earth
  </em>
  , as well as a 2010 adaptation inspired by Shyamalan's film.
  <em>
   The Legend of Korra
  </em>
  game, sharing the title of its source material, was overseen by Platinum Games in 2014, the company recognizable for its work on
  <em>
   Bayonetta
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  , among others. Though the
  <em>
   Legend of Korra
  </em>
  game was perhaps the closest to a true
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  video game experience, its reception was still mixed, with fans citing a good effort for a licensed game that had the potential to be greater.

  Quest For Balance's Poor Reception
 </h3>
 <p>
  Fast forward to 2023, and
  <em>
   Avatar The Last Airbender: Quest for Balance
  </em>
  felt like it came out of nowhere. Announced just months before its release,
  <em>
   Quest for Balance
  </em>
  was quickly met with scrutiny, with comparisons being made to its predecessors nearly a decade prior by way of graphics and gameplay. Speculation quickly grew over rushed development concerns, and by the time of its release, it was evident that the title was doing little to iterate on the licensed games of the IP's past. Comments from fans clamoring for a true
  <em>

  </em>
  -inspired RPG grew in the wake of
  <em>
   Quest for Balance
  </em>
  's lackluster reception, and with it, the potential for a world showing reverence to the series without directly pulling from the same storyline and characters.

  Saber Interactive and Avatar Studios' Collaboration
 </h3>
 <p>
  With Saber Interactive indicating a fresh slate for the
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  games, the degree of freedom offered in the IP's respective world could be exactly what fans have needed after all this time. Saber's work on other titles, like
  <em>
   Evil Dead: The Game
  </em>
  , shows the developer's familiarity with adapting material from film/television to conform with the interactivity of games, and provided that the company is given the proper development time and care, its
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  project could be just what the IP deserves. The enthusiasm over collaborating with Avatar Studios is another great sign, considering DiMartino and Konietzko will likely provide a good bit of creative input, a feat sadly missing from the Netflix show after "creative differences" in its conception.

 <p>
  Though it is likely that fans will be meeting the announcement with tempered expectations, the potential for
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  's world to be fully realized in the gaming medium could be a great accompaniment to the IP's future plans. Avatar Studios is rumored to have multiple films in the works, and a multiplayer fighting game has also been confirmed to be in development by Paramount Consumer Products and Maximum Games, though further details have yet to surface. In regard to the RPG route and just how beloved
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  is to its fans, the IP's success warrants care and attention, and Saber Interactive could be the developer to provide it.

 <p>
  A recently released
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  mod has massively overhauled how NPCs fight by adding new dynamic combat styles to each one. This makes each
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  combat encounter feel unique, with NPCs being assigned specific styles depending on their role.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  At this point, it feels as though there's no part of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  that hasn't been massively overhauled by talented modders. These mods have only gotten better over the years, and as a core mechanic of the game, combat is frequently a focus of some of the best options around. Earlier this year, a different
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  mod made NPCs smarter during ranged combat. The thing that's so special about modding is that players can combine mods like this to create a truly curated experience of their own. Without any sign of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  in the near future,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  modding still has plenty of gas in the tank yet.

 <p>
  The mod is titled SkyTactics - Dynamic Combat Styles, and can be found on Nexus Mods by user Zzyxzz. It adds over 80 new combat styles to the game, which are distributed randomly based on their affiliation to any of the following: humans, guards, soldiers, Forsworn, bosses (one-handed weapon), bosses (two-handed weapon), and Draugr. This adds a ton of depth to the combat, as it always feels as though NPCs will be behaving differently in every scenario. As far as
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  mods that improve NPCs go, it has to go down as one of the best immediately.

  According to Zzyxzz, SkyTactics - Dynamic Combat Styles should be compatible with everything. This is excellent news for players who want to use it with other
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  combat mods. In fact, they even claim that mods that add new combat movesets will benefit massively from this, as they'll be prompted to use their movesets more often as a result. To install SkyTactics - Dynamic Combat Styles, players must also download Skypatcher, another mod used to distribute the combat styles to NPCs.

 <p>
  Almost 13 years since
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's release, it's certainly surprising that gamers are still waiting for the next entry in the series, which was first announced with a vague trailer back in 2018. At this point, it's almost impossible for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  to meet expectations, and Bethesda has a huge task with the upcoming title. It could be years yet before the game releases, but one thing is for sure: the modding community needs to be a priority, as it is undoubtedly the main reason that
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  remains such an active game to this day.

  Freaky Fields is the latest addition to
  <em>

  </em>
  POIs for Chapter 5 and is home to the Billy the Puppet NPC boss. While this location is currently a hot drop due to Billy the Puppet being tied to a quest, players heading there can

  to stay out of sight. These scarecrows provide an excellent hiding spot, allowing players to ambush enemies or escape danger. Here’s

  Freaky Fields has replaced Reckless Railways for Fortnitemares, and will remain on the map till the season comes to a close on November 2.
  <strong>
   Scarecrows can pretty much be found all around Freaky Fields, notably in the wheat fields to the west side of the location

  Scarecrows function much like many of the other hiding locations in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , notably the dumpsters found in various other areas on the map. To hide in a scarecrow in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , players simply need to head on over to any scarecrow on the island and
  <strong>
   press the Use button (F/X/Square)
  </strong>
  . Upon doing so, players will enter the scarecrow, whilst also remaining the freedom to turn around as they please. However, much like other hiding spots,
  <strong>
   the scarecrow will periodically rustle when players are within it
  </strong>
  , which can often give away the player's location if another player is nearby.

  The development team behind
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starship Troopers: Extermination
   </em>
  </strong>
  has laid out big plans for the game in a road map that covers the rest of 2024 and the first half of 2025. Additions coming to
  <em>
   Starship Troopers: Extermination
  </em>
  over the next nine months include optimization and performance upgrades and the addition of a new enemy type and location.

 <p>
  The cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter, which bears a lot of similarities to
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  in the eyes of its fan base, first became available as an Early Access title in May 2023, and it received very positive reactions on Steam, with a player satisfaction rate of 84 percent. The game's official launch, which included its debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, came on October 10. However, recent reviews show the community is now split on whether it's still worth playing. Most of the complaints about the 1.0 version of the game seem to be centered on its instability and lack of polish.

 <p>
  Those two subjects are key points outlined in the road map recently released by publisher/developer Offworld. Project lead Peter Maurice writes in the Steam road map's introductory section that performance enhancements and bug fixes will be two key points throughout the rest of this year, and the development team will continue adjusting performance and adding quality-of-life updates in the coming year. Before this year's end, players can also expect to see a loadout locker addition to the movie franchise-accurate
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  game.

  While most of the plans for the remainder of 2024 seem to be focused on making the game run more smoothly across all available platforms, players can expect to see more content added as 2025 marches on. Content for the first quarter of the year will include a number of new abilities and perks in
  <em>
   Starship Troopers: Extermination
  </em>
  , as well as the addition of five more levels to the game's class progression system. While there haven't been any new enemy types or weapons announced for the first three months of 2025, players will be able to encounter bug holes and modify weapons with the Morita Under Barrel Attachment.

 <p>
  Details on the second quarter of 2025 are a little more sparse, but they will include some of the road map's most exciting features. These features include a new map for the game as well as a new
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  arachnid enemy to fight against. Along with these additions, players can also expect to see the second chapter of the game's highly detailed tutorial launch sometime between April and June.

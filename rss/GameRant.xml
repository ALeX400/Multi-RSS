 <p>
  The best
  <strong>
   horror games
  </strong>
  are those that draw fear from within, rather than relying on typical "horror" tropes. Unlike horror movies or other scary content where the audience is more of an observer, horror games throw players directly into the experience. They’re immersive, and they place players right in the shoes of someone who’s being hunted or haunted. This level of immersion makes horror games uniquely impactful and leaves a stronger psychological mark on their players than any other type of horror media.

 <p>
  What’s even better is that horror games, by their nature, have the flexibility to push fear to terrifying new heights. While relying on jump scares and cliches might be tempting, the most effective horror games take a different path by embracing subtle, immersive methods to unsettle their players. This is why the most impressionable, and in turn the most notoriously famous, horror games are those that
  <strong>
   utilize their environments to create an uncanny atmosphere
  </strong>
  that's hard to ignore.

   <strong>
    Alien: Isolation
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a dark sci-fi survival horror game that's recognized for having one of the most intense gameplay experiences in the horror genre. Despite being a 2014 release, the game features some of the best graphics, storyline, and horror build-ups ever. It's also particularly known for having one of the smartest and most revolutionary AI antagonistic mobs in the horror genre, the Xenomorph.

 <p>
  That's precisely what elevates the entire "horror" aspect of the game and thrusts the player into a constant flight-or-fight state where they have to consistently think about surviving. The game is set in outer space with limited resources, no place to escape, and a very keen awareness of the main character's humanness in the face of an increasingly smart alien being that grows smarter by the minute.

  Playdead's second critically acclaimed game after
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
   Limbo
  </em>
  is another puzzle game released in 2016 called
  <em>
   <strong>
    Inside
   </strong>
  </em>
  . It is technically a spiritual successor to
  <em>
   Limbo
  </em>
  and uses a lot of the same mechanics as the previous game, but ultimately does give off an even more desolate and empty feel.

 <p>
  That "lonely" state of the world and the absolute barrenness of the gameplay is exactly what
  <em>
   Inside
  </em>
  thrives around. Despite being a 2.5D puzzle platformer, the game has a very cold atmosphere that makes it just as creepy and uncanny as some of the bigger games in the same genre. In addition to that, the absence of any established soundtrack, apart from occasional gameplay sounds, and the very greyscale-forward graphics turn it into a deeply unnerving experience. It's almost like there's a constant feeling of being watched and a constant paranoia of impending doom. When players factor in the backstory of the boy—or rather, the lack of it—
  <em>
   Inside
  </em>
  becomes one of the best uncanny games ever made.

  <em>
   <strong>
    SOMA
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a 2014 dark survival first-person psychological horror game that's known for being as dark and atmospheric as its initial impressions suggest. However, what truly makes this game unsettling is the existential dread it instills in players throughout the experience, amplifying its uncanny effect.
 </p>

 <p>
  The game is almost entirely set in an underwater research facility that is set somewhere in the distant future—so it's safe to assume there's been some sort of major apocalyptic event that has pushed the hands of those who made this facility. The game cleverly makes use of horrifyingly accurate music and sound cues like creaking metal, water gushing, and distant pitches that may sound like screams to some. It’s the kind of experience that would have anyone with claustrophobia breaking out in a cold sweat.

   <strong>
    Subnautica

  is a 2018 action-adventure survival game that is notorious for having some of the biggest, scariest, and most nightmarish environments and enemy mobs in the uncanny horror genre.

  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  starts off like any other survival game: the player character is stranded on a strange planet with the simple goal of surviving and exploring
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  It's after the early game that the horror elements really start to pick up pace. The casually harmless and friendly-looking creatures around the player character start growing bigger, and the biomes start becoming darker and harder to navigate. Eventually, players receive the unfortunate luck of coming across the Leviathians; utterly massive sea creatures that make everything around them feel puny and insignificant, which really puts the existential dread aspect into perspective.

   <strong>
    Little Nightmares
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a 2017 puzzle platformer game that features an adorable girl navigating through a very bizarre world that harbors danger at every metaphoric turn that she has to make. Despite how "cutesy" and charming the game initially comes across, it consistently holds a horribly dark and appalling undertone in its atmosphere, one that grows the more the story is revealed.

 <p>
  The game centers around a small and silent nine-year-old girl named Six who has to find her way out of a massive ship without being caught by the adversities she's unquestionably going to run into. Six's personality is characterized by being very nimble, athletic, and occasionally very questionable—pertaining to her going ham on certain creatures and eating them alive when she experiences bouts of hunger. The twisted nature of this little girl's persona, in addition to the grotesque-looking enemy mobs in the game that are consistently after her, along with the overall dark atmosphere that's primarily centered around a child, definitely create a feeling of dread like no other.

  An uncanny atmosphere combined with a proximity voice feature may be one of the most effective horror game tactics to ever exist because of how immersive and almost realistic it makes the gameplay experience.
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Classrooms
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a 2022 game that makes use of this perfectly. It's a first-person procedurally generated horror game that's set entirely in liminal spaces that are infested with some of the creepiest and the most outlandish-looking backroom creatures ever.

 <p>
  What raises the stakes in this particular game is not only its proximity voice feature but also the fact that, because it is a procedurally generated game, it's essentially a different game every time players start it up. No two players are going to have the same experience with the maps and levels in this game. Additionally, because it's designed in a found-footage format,
  <em>
   The Classrooms
  </em>
  essentially becomes a "lived through it" experience.

  Most survival horror games have a freedom to them, correlated to the player character's ability to move around and essentially just hide when there's danger nearby. However, not all horror games offer that.
  <em>
   <strong>
    FLATHEAD
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a Roguelike puzzle game that emulates a tabletop/ board game similar to
  <em>
   Inscryption,
  </em>
  and basically pins the main character to a chair while they try to escape, or at the very least delay, their imminent demise.

  <em>
   FLATHEAD
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is basically an over or under-guessing game, with life and death hanging in the balance. The player is strapped to a machine, and they have to guess if the number that appears on the screen of the machine is going to be higher or lower than the original number. But that's not what the scary part of the game is. It's the unknown creature hidden in the dark that's constantly lingering around the character, waiting for the right time to get them. Combined with the surreal, pitch-black atmosphere,
  <em>
   FLATHEAD
  </em>
  taps into a primal, bone-deep fear that keeps players on edge for every passing moment.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Scorn
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a blatantly nightmarish game that invokes certain feelings in the players simply because of how weird it is. It's a 2022 survival horror that throws the player character into an odd-looking world that blends high-tech futuristic elements with ancient visual cues and abstract body horror to create a freaky dissonance throughout the gameplay.

  The overall dark, gritty, and dusty atmosphere of the map, in addition to the massive maze-like world that's all somehow interconnected and needs to be explored as such, makes
  <em>
   Scorn
  </em>
  one of the best contenders for the uncanny horror genre. Everything players encounter feels tied to a larger, more mysterious scheme, and nothing they come across is truly human or ordinary.

      Some superbosses in
      <em>
       Final Fantasy
      </em>
      are surprisingly easy compared to the challenge they are supposed to pose.
     </li>
     <li>
      With proper preparation and strategy, players can defeat even the toughest superbosses in the game.
     </li>
     <li>
      The key to conquering superbosses lies in maximizing DPS, utilizing summons, and making the most of the game's mechanics.

  <strong>
   Superbosses
  </strong>
  are synonymous with the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. Despite the vast majority of these games being as easy as they come, they still pose major challenges that reward players for leveling up to the nines (or the ninety-nines, in this case) and finding the best equipment to deck out their party.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Most of these superbosses can be ridiculously hard to deal with, but there are instances where
  <strong>
   some superbosses are so easy
  </strong>
  in comparison that players can't help but feel like they don't do justice to their moniker. Still, the satisfaction of defeating these bosses is unmatched and serves as a highlight in these respective
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games.

  When
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 15
   </em>
  </strong>
  was initially being marketed,
  <strong>
   Adamantoise
  </strong>
  was sold as a superboss that could take three in-game days to defeat because of its massive HP pool. This sounds like a chore, but fans can rest assured that an actual fight against Adamantoise won't be as challenging as the game's marketing suggested.
 </p>

 <p>
  This massive tortoise-like being is as imposing as they come, but the damage it deals can be easily healed. Players who maximize Noctis' DPS with unlocks like Armiger Unleashed and the Titan summon can take out a massive chunk of this superboss' health bar in no time and take him down in style.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 8
   </strong>
  </em>
  is notorious for featuring one of the most broken Junction systems of all time, allowing players to max out their stats to kingdom come after drawing 99 units of the highest-tier magic they can find and junctioning it to their stats. With enough grinding, even a tough superboss like the
  <strong>
   Omega Weapon
  </strong>
  can become a walk in the park.

 <p>
  At this point, players are likely aware of Aura and how it lets party members spam Limit Breaks. With high Strength stats, a team of Squall, Zell, and Irvine can decimate Omega Weapon with so many hits that it will die before even getting to unleash its ultimate fight-ending attack, Terra Break.

  focus on character action means that even the toughest foes in the game can be taken out with well-timed dodges and upgraded Eikon abilities without too many problems. This means that an enemy like
  <strong>
   Svarog,
  </strong>
  who is one of the most challenging hunts in the game, can be easily taken out after learning its attack patterns.

  Nailing Precision Dodges and making the most of the attack windows afforded to Clive in this fight will let players take out this superboss after a long but ultimately low-stress battle. Since players can avoid being hit at all and restoratives are plentiful, most people will be able to take out Svaog after a few tries, which isn't bad considering the high standards set by most other superbosses in the game.

  Players who want to fight a samurai who can instantly kill them with a single hit will love the fight against
  <strong>
   Ayakashi
  </strong>
  . This daemon takes on the guise of a samurai and fights as honorably as one can when being ganged up on by
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 15's

  </strong>
  four powerful dudes.

  His insta-kill attacks are the biggest source of worry in this battle, but players shouldn't face too many issues as long as they bring a truckload of Phoenix Downs into battle. This makes for a surprisingly easy encounter where players must enhance their DPS to kingdom come while reviving downed party members from time to time before eventually securing victory.

  <strong>

  players can't help but wonder why
  <strong>

  is even categorized as a superboss at all. It may boast some hard-hitting attacks, but players diligent about Junctioning magic can wipe the floor with this underwhelming foe in no time.

 <p>
  Still, seeing this boss wield Cloud's strongest blade from
  <em>

  is a memorable visual. Before taking this superboss out in record time, players must remember to draw out Eden from him first, which is the strongest Guardian Force in the game.

  The original iteration of
  <strong>
   Omega Weapon
  </strong>
  only had 99,999 HP, making it one of the most underwhelming final bosses for a secret dungeon in the original release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  . So, fans were glad to see that future releases of this game bumped up this enemy's health to a whopping 999,999 HP.

  This makes it a lengthy encounter that can still be manageable with fully upgraded Celestial Weapons that break the damage limit and can deplete this foe's health bar in a flash. Even without these weapons, players can still take on Omega Weapon and secure victory as long as they heal at regular intervals.

  The
  <strong>
   Behemoth King
  </strong>
  is one of the most iconic enemies in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series. So, it's only fitting that this foe appears as a superboss in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  However, while it may feature some flashy visuals, the fight itself is mostly underwhelming.

 <p>
  The S-Rank hunt can be a bit tricky, but the dodging mechanic is pretty forgiving and every Eikon's ultimate ability can hit for ridiculous levels of damage when fully upgraded. As long as players are concentrating on avoiding its high-damage moves, the Behemoth King should be a piece of cake to take out.

 <p>
  In 2022, Striking Distance Studios and Krafton attempted to deliver their own
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  with the hotly-anticipated
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  . That game was supposed to bring players on an exciting new survival horror adventure, but instead, it was met with mixed reviews and ended up falling flat with audiences. However, that has seemingly not stopped Striking Distance Studios from going all in on this new IP, as it has a new title up its sleeve in the form of the roguelike spin-off
  <strong>

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  may not quite be on the level of other recent hit roguelikes, Striking Distance Studios has crafted a pretty strong title here. It puts players in the shoes of a prison guard from
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  's Black Iron Prison, and in classic roguelike fashion, tasks them with fighting their way to safety. Through this, players will conquer all sorts of enemies, meet a fun cast of characters, and play around with countless wild abilities. But, even though that does make for an experience fans of the genre do not want to miss out on,
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  is not without its hiccups.

 <p>
  Anyone who has ever touched a roguelike will know what to expect with
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  's core gameplay loop. When they first start, they are put in control of a prison guard within Black Iron Prison. While that may seem pretty straightforward, things quickly take a turn for the worst as it is revealed that the prison itself is falling into disarray. Prisoners are escaping, creatures are attacking, and there is only one escape pod left. So, players must fight their way through the prison in hopes that they can reach the pod before it is too late.

 <p>
  Players will fight their way through a room filled with hazards, earn a power-up or currency at the end, and then go to the next room to do it all over again. As they progress further, more adversaries will fill these rooms, more paths will be unlocked, and even stronger enemies will appear. But players will also get stronger in the process, which will hopefully help them make it to the end.

 <p>
  On their journey, they will also occasionally run into even more powerful bosses that they must take out before progressing to the next area. These bosses are often extremely challenging, forcing players to use all the powers at their disposal to come out on top. If those were not hard enough, there may also be a few surprise bosses in store as players fight their way through
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  's many regions. If they die, they can just do it all over again.

 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , players can push their way through the prison using a wide assortment of weaponry and special abilities, with each one requiring them to switch up their strategy. Additionally, the more runs they do, the more upgrades they will be able to unlock. And hopefully, as they restart, they will not only get more powerful, but will also be able to get farther and farther until they finally reach that escape pod, only to do the whole thing over once more.

  's core gameplay loop is not that different from what has come before, but that is what makes it so satisfying. There is a reason that games like
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  are so popular, and Striking Distance Studios is able to replicate that extremely well. Luckily, the studio did not just stop at a simple copy-and-paste, as it has also injected some exciting new mechanics into the mix that will surely spice things up.

  One of the most interesting new ideas is that players are not the only ones trying to escape this prison. In fact, there are up to three Black Iron Prison residents also fighting their way through these rooms. These characters are far more than simple background fluff, as they can actually impact the player's runs. Randomly, they will lash out against the player by making the rooms more difficult, like turning off the lights, giving enemies strong shields, or making everything explode. Additionally, players may run into them and be forced to fight them in a timed boss battle. As players learn more about their opponents via their redacted files, these boss battles will get easier, and eventually, players will be able to defeat them with ease.

 <p>
  These residents are not the only ones that can mess with runs in
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  , as the player can actually attack them with an assortment of abilities. These abilities range from simply damaging them to slowing them down, which all exist on a cooldown timer. Once an attack is available, players get to choose which person they are attacking, and then must hit the correct buttons in the correct order to activate it. As they complete more runs, they will be able to unlock even more fun attacks.

 <p>
  Along with these residents, players will also be able to fight themselves. Once they die, their body is left behind, and they take control of a brand-new guard. If they encounter the same room they died in, they can actually fight the undead corpse of their last character for some special rewards. These corpses will not only use many of the same abilities and power-ups they died with, but will also have a few surprises in store. So, players will want to ensure they are ready to take on this fight. If they are not, these fights are luckily entirely optional.

 <p>
  All of this makes
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  a pretty exciting roguelike that genre fans will surely enjoy. However, the core story may not be as intriguing as it could be. Since
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  left much to be desired, many players may not be as attached to the setting. Additionally, the way the story is told does little to make the setting stand out, as players do not have a large cast of characters to interact with, nor are the actual rooms that memorable. Instead, it feels pretty similar to every other sci-fi universe out there.

 <p>
  The enemy variety also seems to be lacking a bit, especially early on. When there are different types of enemies, they do not always have that different of attacks from what has come before, making them all feel pretty similar. The fact the game has very few major bosses also does not help. Of course, there is still a massive challenge to be had here, but those looking for a ton of variety may not find it.

  Overall,
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  is a strong addition to the roguelike genre. The mechanics are fun, the game's unique features help spruce things up considerably, and the core gameplay loop is extremely satisfying. However, it does lack some variety, and the actual setting lacks a unique flair. While that does not ruin the experience, it may hold it back for some. But if players are looking for another title to spend hours on, this game may be for them.

  Liz is the second Rival you meet in
  <em>

  </em>
  , and she's part of the personnel in the prison. She used to be a cook, but now she's trying to escape the zombie-infested hell that you've both found yourself in. And, as usual, there's only one escape pod.

  If you have Liz as one of the Rivals in your run, then you're going to need to know how to effectively use your remote attacks. Then, at some point, she'll challenge you to a duel, and you'll need to be equipped to take her on and defeat her.

  Like other Rivals in
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  , it's important not to take Liz on in a duel too early; otherwise, the fight will be much more difficult. She performs her attacks in quick succession, so it can be difficult to dodge them in time and do damage of your own without taking significant hits. Here are some tips to perform at your best when you fight her:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":833} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":900} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":0} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Use Damage Remote Attacks to tick down her health before you duel her.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use Stopping Remote Attacks to get ahead of her so she can't use any against you.
  </li>
  <li>
   Prioritize experiments that give you damage boosts when you dash/dash attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   Equip suits that will help you find the right experiments.
  </li>
  <li>
   Equip fast-hitting melee weapons.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":263} -->
 <p>
  Liz comes at you fast when you face her in a duel, and unlike normal enemies, she won't get stunned if you hit her continuously. So, the best way to deal with her is to get up close, dash away, and return quickly to get some damage in. Then, it's all about rinsing and repeating this process.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  If you can equip experiments like
  <strong>
   High Tension Wire (Energy)
  </strong>
  that deals damage when you dash attack, you'll have a significant upper hand against her. Otherwise,
  <strong>
   Bombshell (Physical)
  </strong>
  is another great experiment that lets you drop bombs as you dash away - and they'll hit her as she chases you around the room.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Barman Shankers
  </strong>
  are the perfect early-game melee weapon against her because you can get in and out quickly without sacrificing too much damage. Additionally, if you can fabricate
  <strong>
   Swing Speed and/or Melee Reach
  </strong>
  before you duel with her, you'll have some extra time to hit her hard before getting out and dodging her attacks.

 <p>
  It's likely that you'll duel Liz as soon as the Sludge Tunnel, which is also when you should be strong enough to give her a run for her money. The Sludge Suit is a nice pick because it lets you take 25% less damage on that level. If you want to prioritize getting the right experiments for this fight, the Physical Suit or Energy Suit should be your pick. Both will help you find experiments in their respective categories more frequently, giving you a chance to pick up powerful attacks that work well against Liz.

 <p>
  If you don't manage to take Liz down in your duel, don't worry because you just need to make sure you survive it well enough that you have time to continue your remote attacks on her. Once the timer for the lockdown reaches 0, she will try and escape, and sometimes, her health won't be low enough to finish her off. This is why it's important to upgrade your Damage Remote Attacks, though, so you can make sure she does fall eventually during your
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  run.

  that can be quite tough to take down, especially considering that they carry melee and ranged weapons that can make getting through the prison very difficult (or even more difficult).

  Sark is the first Rival you'll meet in

  , and he's a prisoner who wants to beat you to the escape pod. While you can use remote attacks to slow him down, at some point, you'll come face-to-face with him and need to beat him in order to get to the pod first.

  The first thing you'll want to ensure is that you don't run into Sark too early; otherwise, he's going to be nearly impossible to take down. Take your time, use your remote attacks, and make sure that you're well-prepared before trying to fight him. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":900} -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   Use your remote attacks to tick down Sark's health.
  </li>
  <li>
   Try and stay ahead of Sark in the race so you don't have to deal with his gas remote attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   Try and clear rooms quickly to get your remote attacks back quicker.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pick experiments that can help you perform longer-range attacks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Don't pick a fight with him if you're not ready.
  </li>
  <li>
   Unlock his personnel files to decrease the damage he does.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Sark uses a combination of long-range and melee attacks to get close and do a lot of damage to you in quick succession. As a result, experiments like
  <strong>
   Never Look Back (Combustion)
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Vicious Circle (Cryo)
  </strong>
  can be great. Both help with longer-range attacks, and Vicious Circle, in particular, can be quite strong if you use your dash to get around him.

 <p>
  Essentially, you want to follow a pattern of dashing around Sark's short-range attacks and then going in for hits once he's stopped chasing you around the room. Following this ensures you don't take too much damage while still getting hits on him, making it easier to take him down.

 <p>
  As for weapons, you can use melee weapons with a fast attack or slow attack against Sark, as your experiments will be your main attack against him. It's worth considering using something like the
  <strong>
   Electric Whip or Kinetic Hammer
  </strong>
  to get one massive hit of damage in between dashes.

 <p>
  Speaking of remote attacks, you'll want to invest in Damage Attacks and Stopping or Slowing Attacks to make sure that you can tick down his health and get ahead of him in the race. Stopping Attacks are particularly useful here because getting ahead of him in the race ensures that he can't use his remote attacks against you - and his gas attack can be particularly lethal if he catches you unprepared.

  Lastly, whenever you spot a folder above a door, go through it to find a computer that contains information about the Rivals in your current run. For every piece of information you reveal about them, they do 15% less damage to you, which can give you the edge you need against Sark in

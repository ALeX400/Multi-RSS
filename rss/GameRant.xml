  Perhaps more than any other genre, role-playing games offer players a chance to fully immerse themselves in both a world and a story. By granting control of both a character and the quest they must embark on, the best
  <strong>
   Game Pass RPGs
  </strong>
  allow players to experience the rewarding upward climb of progression.

  Most RPGs tend to be hefty time sinks, but that only goes to show how immersive these titles can be. Luckily for those who own Xbox Game Pass, phenomenal RPG games are available at a moment’s notice. Whether someone prefers JRPGs, Western epics, or indie darlings; Microsoft's subscription service has them covered. What are the
  <strong>
   best RPGs

  After a long and challenging development cycle, GSC's
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  is finally readily available on Game Pass. Despite launching with its share of technical issues, the ambitious open-world's positives far outweigh its negatives, to the point of being worthy of a cautious recommendation (but someone's mileage may vary depending on the bugs they encounter).
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the game is primarily known for its open-world and survival elements, the latter of which directly determine not only the mechanics but also the gameplay loop and mission structure. Still,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  qualifies as an RPG, delivering a fully developed storyline and setting while allowing players to make choices that influence their character's progression and, more importantly, the larger world.

  Following up Obsidian's fantastic
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured But Whole
  </em>
  is cut from a very similar cloth, albeit with tweaked combat and a storyline that tackles the superhero genre rather than fantasy. As the New Kid on the block, players get dragged into an all-out civil war between pretend heroes, with Cartman naturally catalyzing most of the mayhem.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the humor and story will probably not hold too many surprises for people very familiar with the source material,
  <em>
   The Fractured But Whole
  </em>
  works well as an extension of
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  that allows fans to explore the town fairly freely. The turn-based battle system is polished and flashy, while offering just enough of a challenge to remain interesting throughout the campaign.

  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate owners have access to the full
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  franchise. If they prefer, they can jump into the original Xbox 360 versions. These hold up reasonably well, particularly the sequels; however,
  <em>
   Mass Effect Legendary Edition
  </em>
  is the best way to experience Commander Shepard's story in this day and age. The package contains remastered versions of BioWare's classic trilogy, and the compilation also includes most of the DLC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond a facelift, the
  <em>
   Legendary Edition
  </em>
  revamps the original
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  game quite extensively, bringing it more in line with the content and gameplay of its sequels. These changes make the trilogy a more consistent overall experience. Each entry is fantastic in its own right, and when combined,
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  makes one of the best video game trilogies of all time.

  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  's shadow looms large over Atlus' entire franchise, and its fingerprints can be seen in
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  , Atlus' 2024 remake of 2006's PS2 JRPG. However, this iteration is still 100%
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  , retaining the original's dark atmosphere, fantastic storytelling, and Tartarus. In a series that has produced almost nothing but stellar games,
  <em>
   P3
  </em>
  stands as a genuine contender for its crowning achievement, and
  <em>
   Reload
  </em>
  shows the classic JRPG all the respect it deserves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blending dungeon-crawling with social sim aspects,
  <em>
   P3R
  </em>
  strikes an outstanding balance that satisfies both genres' needs in a way that ensures they complement each other. During the day, players get to live the life of a Japanese high school student, which involves attending class and hanging out with friends. These sections are the campaign's beating heart, granting depth to the characters while also weaving a powerful tale that tackles mostly mature themes.
 </p>
 <p>
  At night, players lead a party into an intense dungeon crawling with Persona, creatures that can be added to the protagonist's arsenal. As a monster-collecting game,
  <em>
   P3R
  </em>
  offers a wide and impressive roster of candidates, and the game expects players to be constantly cycling through new party members by either catching Persona or using the fusion system. While the JRPG's turn-based combat is fairly traditional for the genre,
  <em>
   P3R
  </em>
  elevates the action through a fantastic presentation and supporting mechanics that inject an element of strategy into battles.

  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  has essentially ruled the open-world RPG roost since its unsubtle and highly-anticipated release in 2011 — that alone should be enough to showcase its necessity for any RPG enthusiast's repertoire. While it can be safely accused of shedding the deeper mechanical complexities of its predecessors, the cold fact of the matter is that Bethesda did more than a few things right.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  preserves the franchise's legacy of beautifully designed open worlds filled with enough content to keep even the most dedicated gamers busy for years while expanding the scope of its audience exponentially. It's practically gaming's equivalent to required reading at this point, and it's not hard to see why.

  The addition of
  <strong>
   EA Play to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate
  </strong>
  brought with it plenty of great RPGs, including some of the best trilogies in gaming.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  is the definition of an epic; a grandiose adventure filled with political intrigue, narrative depth, complex combat, and unforgettable characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game is at its best on PC, but the Xbox 360 version is perfectly playable. While somewhat dated by today's standards,
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  has aged beautifully in the areas that matter the most: world-building, storytelling, and character-build variety. The sequels are also worth checking out, but
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  arguably peaked with its first entry, setting a standard that few fantasy RPGs have come close to replicating.

  2024 has produced a couple of major AAA games, but arguably none of them attracted as much attention as
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  . While still in early access (or Game Preview on Xbox), Pocket Pair's project is already in fine shape, offering a fairly robust and complete experience that still has plenty of room for expansion. As
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  proved in 2023, a lengthy spell in early access could be the difference between a good and fantastic game, and the latter could easily be used to describe
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  in its current form.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before its release, the project was labeled as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  with guns, a descriptor that, while accurate, sells the project's scope short.
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is a survival open-world game with monster-collecting, base building, third-person shooting, RPG mechanics, and co-op. On the surface, it might seem like Pocket Pair is trying to reach too many audiences, but the pieces come together to create a surprisingly cohesive whole.
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is addictive, and while there is not much of a story, the basic gameplay loop is more than fun enough to keep players engaged for dozens upon dozens of hours.

  If strategy games can seem inapproachable to newcomers, then grand strategy titles must seem absolutely foreign.
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  represents the subgenre at its best, and it is arguably Paradox's crowning achievement, a statement that is not made lightly. While needing no introduction to players fond of these sorts of games,
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  might seem too dense for people who have yet to dip their toes in the universe of grand strategies; however, although not easy to master, the game is among the most accessible options on the market.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly,
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  is a proper RPG that follows a family tree as the members' decisions shape their kingdoms and the rest of the world. Along with fairly standard grand strategy mechanics, Paradox emphasizes each character's personality, encouraging players to properly role-play as their rulers. Unlike most other entries in this subgenre,
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  is primarily about the individuals who mold history through their relationships, biases, flaws, and strengths.

  Even if it is not as synonymous with JRPGs as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , Bandai Namco's
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  is one of the genre's most beloved franchises, and an argument could be made that it is the definitive action property. While fairly consistent in terms of quality, a few entries stand out from the crowd, and
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  is one of the best games in the series. The 2021 release also serves as a great introduction to the IP, and since the story is not connected to any previous releases, newcomers can jump into this project without hesitation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Telling a fairly major story that tackles themes of discrimination and oppression,
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  blends strong storytelling with addictive combat, likable characters, and a fair amount of secondary content. While the campaign is quite long, new settings and mechanics are introduced frequently enough to ensure things remain interesting throughout, and all the playable characters are unique and come with learning curves.

  Soulslike games belong to their own genre, but they still fall under the action RPG umbrella.
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  is an inspired take on the Soulsborne formula, even if its core mechanics do not stray too far from the beaten path. Cast as Pinocchio, players will find themselves exploring Krat, a Gothic fallen utopia that has become overrun by deadly puppets who come in a wide range of shapes and sizes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike some other entries in the genre,
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  has a fixed protagonist and does not offer too many customization options, at least not in the opening few hours. Players can select from three combat styles, and they unlock new weapons at a steady but not overwhelming pace. Importantly,
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  nails its combat and enemy design, offering fast-paced and aggressive action that demands players master all the game's mechanics, particularly parrying.

  Blizzard's
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is a weird beast. The hack and slash RPG attracted near-universal praise at launch and was regarded as a solid evolution for the franchise. However, the game's reputation declined quite quickly after that point, with a few subsequent updates being viewed as a step back rather than a leap forward. Nowadays, the RPG exists in a strange space where it feels somewhat like old news, although
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Loot Reborn patch was a huge move in the right direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Polarizing as it might be,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is nevertheless massive. Except for a more expansive open-world and a couple of touches, Blizzard's action RPG does not reinvent the wheel, instead opting to offer a straightforward combat-loot-combat loop. The story is fine but nothing special, and it largely exists to keep people busy until they reach the endgame. The combat is simplistic as well, but it is satisfying in a shut-off-your-brain type of way. Unsurprisingly, the game floods players with loot, which provides a small dopamine hit every time. For all its divisive elements, at its core,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is a pretty good action RPG that has the potential to be better. If someone is on the fence about trying this sequel, they can now jump on board thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

  Xbox Game Pass has a couple of monster-collecting games. Those titles can keep someone busy for months on end, but Atlus' series has some competition. Initially launching on PC before making its way to consoles,
  <em>
   Cassette Beasts
  </em>
  is a fantastic indie project that takes inspiration from the likes of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , particularly the older isometric entries, while also crafting a unique voice that sets it apart from its peers. Arriving at a peculiar island called New Wirral, players are quickly greeted by a ranger who tells them about their ability to transform into beasts, which they will need to do to survive the habitat's wildlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Cassette Beasts
  </em>
  ' title gives its monster-taming mechanic away: players "catch" creatures by recording them on a cassette tape. If successful, the protagonist and their human partners will be able to transform into them during battles. Set in a vibrant and diverse open-world, the game offers a creative modernization of this RPG subgenre's typical formula, and it even manages to incorporate a pretty interesting story. Along with the main campaign, players have quite a few side activities to keep them busy.

  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  is a cutthroat game that takes no prisoners. Players inherit a mansion sitting on top of a strange dungeon, so they hire heroes to explore the creepy labyrinth within. Like most RPGs, these characters come in a variety of classes and can be leveled up; unlike most RPGs, death is permanent in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . There is nothing quite as infuriating as watching a powerful hero meet their maker, never to be seen again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Hook's game uses a turn-based combat system that centers around parties of four characters. While exploring the dungeon, players have to monitor the heroes' stress levels along with a myriad of other mechanics. It is quite a challenge.

  August and September 2023 produced two of 2023's biggest RPGs:
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . Most indie projects released around the same time as these games were destined to be overshadowed, and that's without even mentioning
  <em>
   Armored Core 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  . Therefore, the fact that
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  still managed to make a splash speaks to its quality. Inspired by '90s JRPGs, Sabotage crafted a gem that pays tribute to its influential ancestors without fully anchoring itself to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set on an island,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  follows two heroes tasked with defeating a spreading corruption. On the surface, this premise might sound generic, but it is all about the execution. Not only does the lengthy storyline take a few genuine risks as it progresses, but it is also packed with endearing characters and fun optional content. The turn-based combat system is pretty great too.

  Launching in 2016,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  has blossomed into one of gaming's most enduring farming sims. The indie game comes packed with so much content and freedom that two people could wind up having completely different experiences. Whether planning out a year's worth of farming or sparking a romance with one of the NPCs,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is incredibly immersive.

  Offering endearing visuals, expansive customization options, and a lot to discover, this game will keep somebody playing for months on end. For those looking for a title that doesn't prioritize combat but is still quite challenging in places,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  is a stellar pick.

  Both
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  entries are available on Xbox Game Pass, and together they can easily keep someone engaged for more than 100 hours. While the first game is well worth a playthrough, the sequel offers more of the same, just slightly improved in a couple of areas. Their stories, characters, and worlds are not related either, so newcomers can jump into the second game if they would rather skip its predecessor (although, again,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  is very good).
 </p>
 <p>
  So, what is
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  ? Well, these projects are essentially throwbacks to classic JRPGs from the 1990s, sort of similar to the
  <em>
   Bravely Default
  </em>
  games. However, they take a page from
  <em>
   Live a Live
  </em>
  's playbook by focusing on character-specific storylines that are fairly standalone. That said, the playable characters are united through a central quest, and they do come across more like a genuine party than their counterparts in the first
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  . The turn-based combat is traditional but well-executed.

  All three
  <em>

  games are available on Xbox Game Pass, and each one improves on the last.
  <em>
   Wasteland 3
  </em>
  is a challenging
  <strong>
   strategy turn-based RPG
  </strong>
  reminiscent of classic
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  titles, and it comes with a dark sense of humor and a desire to constantly challenge players with difficult decisions.
 </p>
 <p>
  A deep and flexible combat system should keep the game feeling fresh throughout its considerable length, while
  <em>
   Wasteland 3
  </em>
  's story and world-building are second to none. Co-op is also possible for those who want to travel through Colorado with a friend.

  Released in 2008,
  <em>
   Fable 2
  </em>
  returns players to the wonderful world of Albion. All three games in the series have their positives and negatives, but
  <em>
   Fable 2
  </em>
  is the most complete and satisfying experience in the trilogy. Players roam an enchanting realm as they set out to carve their own paths and highlight their unique quirks. Albion reacts to the player's actions, developing to match the choices made throughout the adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Fable 2
  </em>
  takes place in a living, breathing world that empowers users but also doesn't forget the deeds (or misdeeds) they perform. Although not amazing, the real-time combat system is serviceable and offers enough variety to remain engaging throughout the campaign.

  Obsidian Entertainment is firmly established as a leading developer in the RPG sphere, and
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  might be the company's crowning achievement. Both entries in the series rank among the
  <strong>
   best role-playing games on Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  , but
  <em>
   Deadfire
  </em>
  gets the nod since it saw the franchise grow out of its
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  roots into something more singular.
 </p>
 <p>
  A pirate-themed adventure, this isometric RPG gives players a ship and a crew to sail the ocean, allowing them to visit a multitude of islands and take part in naval battles throughout their journey. The story is solid, but
  <em>
   Deadfire
  </em>
  shines the brightest in its combat, customization, and sense of discovery.

  is ambitious. TaleWorlds' project blends action RPG elements with strategy mechanics, crafting an experience that is quite unlike anything else on the market. Players start from nothing as they steadily build their mercenary group, eventually seeking to take over land and spread their influence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2
  </em>
  can be overwhelming, particularly for people who did not play the previous games or are not that familiar with sandbox strategy games. However, it might be able to fill a void that no other title on Game Pass can reach.

  If you focus solely on the main races and skip most of the side content, you won’t spend much time in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  . Playing this way will
  <strong>
   take you approximately 20 hours
  </strong>
  . However, this approach isn’t how most players would recommend experiencing the game.
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  offers incredible side content that’s well worth exploring. In fact, some of the side races rival, or even surpass, the main races in terms of excitement and design.

  One of the standout features of
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  is its expansive open-world map, showcasing a diverse array of biomes. From lush forests and arid deserts to vibrant cities and even a towering volcano, there’s so much to see and do beyond the main events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exploring the map and participating in side races can significantly extend your playtime, potentially more than doubling it. If you’re committed to fully experiencing the vibrant world of Mexico and completing as many side races as possible, you can
  <strong>
   easily invest around 50 hours in the game
  </strong>
  .

  For those dedicated to achieving 100% completion,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  offers a ridiculous amount of content to conquer. This means finishing every race, completing all side events, unlocking all cars, and smashing every billboard scattered across the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reaching 100% completion will
  <strong>
   take most players over 100 hours
  </strong>
  , depending on your pace and attention to detail. This estimate doesn’t include the additional time you might spend simply cruising around the map, soaking in the scenery, and chilling to the game’s fantastic soundtrack. For completionists, this journey is a rewarding and immersive experience, making the most of everything
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  has to offer.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Rally Adventure Expansion:
   </strong>
   Focusing on intense off-road racing in the rugged Sierra Nueva, this expansion offers a slightly shorter experience, clocking in at 5 to 7 hours.

   Exploring lost civilizations
  </strong>
  has long been a source of fascination in video games, blending mystery, history, and adventure. From ancient ruins to forgotten empires, these games often immerse players in exotic worlds brimming with secrets and challenges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some games have a lost civilization as the backdrop to the storyline to provide a mysterious and atmospheric setting. Others focus solely on discovering the secrets of a lost civilization, uncovering artifacts, or defeating ancient enemies. These are sometimes mythological civilizations based on actual legends, cleverly mixing known history with fantasy aspects. Others are fantastical constructs that have come from the minds of the game's designers.

  The 2013 release of the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tomb Raider
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  game is part of the franchise reboot, and returns to the tried and tested recipe used by the original movie and the early games in the series. Namely, Lara Croft heads off to find treasure by discovering the remnants of a lost civilization; the Yamatai civilization in this case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having become stranded on an island, Lara must uncover the secrets of the island's Queen Himiko as she explores, overcomes puzzles, and gets ever closer to the truth and the treasure that comes with it. The game has a great narrative, and the ancient ruins are very atmospheric.

  does not expressly revolve around the tale of a lost civilization, the game’s setting and world-building certainly do. The world is filled with mysterious ruins and ancient architecture, all situated in a haunting, desolate landscape.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of the game is for the player to defeat each of the 16 giant colossi that roam the land. Each of these is a huge boss that is part organic and part construction. The game’s esthetics are beautiful yet haunting, with an underlying theme of loss and desolation.

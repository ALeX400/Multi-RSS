  <strong>
   The low fantasy genre
  </strong>
  is popular among fans for its innovative and thoughtful blending of realism and fantasy, with elements like magic and monsters subtly added to a work that may already be grounded in political and historical lore. Unlike high fantasy, this combination allows players to explore real-world scenarios and familiar locations, but with a heightened sense of creativity and abstraction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some players might even consider the genre the best of both worlds, straddling the line between highly realistic drama and completely otherworldly concepts. This article explores t

  , where realistic and imaginative motifs combine to produce immersive, engaging stories.

   <em>
    Dredge
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a maritime approach to low fantasy, with its bleak and inhospitable setting, an archipelago dotted with fishing towns, and an uneasiness in the air. The gameplay focuses on a fisherman exploring the waters and catching fish while exploring mysterious secrets in a combination of resource management and fantastical but subtle supernatural horror.
 </p>
 <p>
  The eldritch atmosphere hints towards subtle fantastical elements of the world but is otherwise grounded in reality. In fact, while much of the game presents nothing out of the ordinary, the player's patience pays off in the end, with some fascinating experiences to be had during the long dark nights spent out at sea.

   <strong>
    The Age of Decadence
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a turn-based CRPG that strives to go above and beyond the traditional RPG genre. Set in a dying empire, players must navigate political plots and factional conflicts in a terrific open-world setting where decisions truly shape the direction of the story and impact the ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  This game offers more realism than a lot of RPGs with fantasy elements, with the primary mission being survival in a world full of complex characters with hidden motives and allegiances. In the setting, which is partially inspired by Ancient Rome, there are remnants of ancient magic and hints of the divine, but they are not as prominent as in more traditional fantasy worlds.

  players take on the role of a nameless convict sent to a penal colony called Khorinis which has been magically sealed off from the outside world. Within the colony, there's varied gameplay, including factional conflicts and survival elements, with choices coming into play in shaping the story.

  The setting of

  is a great example of gritty, thoughtful realism. Unforgiving and oppressive locations like forests and mines can be explored throughout the story, with mechanisms that enhance the narrative and its authenticity. Players can work, sleep, eat, and develop connections, all with the hope of survival.

   <em>
    Darklands
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a classic historical RPG, with a rich world based upon medieval Germany during the 15th Century. By way of low fantasy, the game offers alchemical magic, mythical creatures, and sophisticated folklore elements in an otherwise grounded, realistic world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game was praised as the first historical fantasy game designed for computer gameplay, with its original release date being 1992. Nowadays, it has earned cult-classic status as a striking, iconic exploration of Medieval European warfare with some seriously cool retro graphics, and it's still available on Steam.

   </strong>
  </em>
  is a murder mystery full of twists and turns. Players control an alcoholic detective tasked with solving a crime in the run-down city of Revachol, a place that is largely grounded in reality, but that features elements of surrealism and metaphysical fantasy that add to its philosophical depth and sophistication. These can be as minor as rumors of mythological cryptids, or as vast the interdimensional fog that separates Revachol from the rest of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game offers many branching narratives, each with rich dialogue and existential dilemmas to keep players on their toes. Unlike many of the games on this list,
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  relies heavily on text and there is almost no combat at all, making it an unusual and offbeat RPG choice for low fantasy lovers.

  is a fascinating game set on a mysterious colonized island where issues of diplomacy, political conflict, and the supernatural affect the choice-driven story. The game successfully combines its realistic subject matter with magic through its historical, gritty setting that confronts real-world issues with fluidity.

  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  maps can create incredible games that are more than unique on their own - one such map is Fortophobia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortophobia is essentially a recreation of
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  within
  <em>
   Fortnite's
  </em>
  Creative map creator. Fortophobia is an almost flawless replica of
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  in terms of gameplay; the game map even features players in a first-person POV.

  Fans of
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Friday the 13th
  </em>
  will enjoy this Creative map as it takes clear inspiration from the two horror survival games. Teddy is a game that pits one player against the rest of the lobby.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the several different maps that players can choose, the survivors must gather keys and items to escape whichever map they are on. On the other hand, Teddy (the killer), must seek out all of the other players and take them out using their harvesting tool. Overall, this game makes for a wonderful experience outside the usual battle royale, especially if you have a group of friends to play with you.

  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has certainly left its mark on the video game world, and Skyblock Adventure recreates one of the most popular game modes in the popular survival game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Skyblock Adventure is a Creative map that takes the Skyblock mode from
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  and recreates it in
  <em>
   Fortnite's
  </em>
  very own font. As such, players will spawn on a small island where they must harvest building materials in order to build themselves to the other tiny islands that are floating in the sky; much like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , enemies will spawn at night to hunt the player(s).

  Hyper Freeze Tag works similarly to Catch. Penguins are hunters and must track down humans and catch them. However, in this game, when a penguin gets close to a human and catches them, they freeze and are unable to move. A fellow human teammate has to come and rescue them, as they can destroy the ice and set them free by hitting it with their pickaxe.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a fun game to play with a large group of friends, especially if gamers are able to chat through voice chat. Things can get chaotic, especially when friends are begging to get rescued.

  Though the name sounds very similar to Fortophobia, these Creative maps are very different. Cosmophobia is a game that pits players in a unique free-for-all map, and it's set in a spaceship that is currently being taken over by aliens. Not only that, but the ship is just about irreparable at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players must complete eight missions while wandering around the ship, and the first one to complete all of their missions will be able to race toward the final door to escape the ship in a rocket. This one-of-a-kind race will certainly make for a great time.

  Motorcycle Color Switch is one of
  <em>
   Fortnite's
  </em>
  many Creative maps that fall within the mode's party games genre. Originally, Color Switch was a game mode that placed all players on a large, tiled floor with each tile representing a different color.
 </p>
 <p>
  To survive, players must stay on a colored tile ordered by the game; otherwise, they will fall to their death. In Motorcycle Color Switch, players will essentially play a game with the same concept as Color Switch, but this time the players will all be on dirt bikes rather than running around freely. It's a fast-paced version of the original Color Switch game.

  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is home to one of the most fun PvP game modes around since the early stages of the game, and that is Spleef. Spleef is a game mode in which players are all gathered onto a large floor. To win the game, a player must be the last player standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure the other players lose, players need to attempt to break the floor below their friends so that they fall. Ultimate Spleef in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is the same thing, but players can use various items to ensure that they win.

  Prop Hunt has been one of the most viral video game modes ever since its popularity boost in GMod (Garry's Mod). It came as no surprise when it became one of the most popular game types in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Creative.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prop Hunt: Modern Mall is a classic take on the Prop Hunt genre, as it places players inside a multilevel mall. Props will need to use various items to blend in with their environment, and the hunters must use their skills to eliminate the Props before the time runs out.

  Pillars of Fortune is perfect for gamers who enjoy building in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and want to have a good time with their friends. In this game, players will start on a single pillar while random items spawn in their inventory and their materials increase. The objective is to be the last player standing in this unusual setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players have to risk leaving their pillar if they'd like to move or try to eliminate an opponent. However, they must also build protective barriers to make sure that they're not taken by surprise by another player and eventually go to the middle so they aren't lost to the storm as it starts closing in. Ultimately, the key to victory is thinking fast, as gamers must manage their inventory while focusing on their surroundings and the storm.

  Dodgecoal initially soared in popularity upon being released and pushed forward by Epic on their Creative page. Chalet - Dodgecoal is
  <em>
   Fortnite's
  </em>
  own take on the classic dodgeball game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players are split up into two different teams, and on the back walls of each team, coal will spawn as items for players to pick up. True to its name, players can throw the coal at their opponents in order to strike them out and win the game. This Dodgecoal map has different items and features that give it a high replay value.

  With games like

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Get Over It
  </em>
  relishing in their popularity, it wasn't long before
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  became host to a Creative map with a likeness to the difficult genre. Only Up Fortnite! is a clear-cut copy of
  <em>
   Only Up
  </em>
  for fans of the famous title browsing through
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Only Up Fortnite! starts players off on the ground, where a complex and seemingly endless tower of random items climbs themselves upward toward the sky. The objective? For players to conquer this tower of random objects and make their way to the top.

  Fans of parkour and deathrun-like maps will more than just enjoy this well-received Creative map, as Dino Run! makes use of Unreal Engine 5 in one of the most tantalizing ways - introducing a complete T-rex that is larger than expected and chases after players. Dino Run! is a simple deathrun match that eliminates players if they fall behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  While running through a series of obstacles and traps, a T-rex stomps its way through the jungle in hopes of catching the players. With friends alongside players, Dino Run! becomes a great competition to see who can outrun each other, as well as the monstrous dinosaur rampaging after them.

  Gamers looking for a Creative experience with one of their buddies will undoubtedly have a great time with Raft Tycoon, the perfect two-player raft simulator. While exploring this map, gamers will have to set up fish farms, fruit and veggie farms, mushroom and tree farms, and even animal farms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Initially, they'll find themselves stranded on a single pallet; however, as they accumulate resources and gold, they'll be able to expand farther and farther. While the concept is simple - collect resources, sell them, build more farms, - the repetitiveness of this experience can easily keep players hooked for hours to see what they'll be able to build next.

  Fans of the TV show
  <em>
   Survivor
  </em>
  and competitive survival games like
  <em>
   RUST
  </em>
  will thoroughly enjoy the unique experience that is Campfire. When starting Campfire, which is one of the most well-made maps on the entire
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Creative platform using UEFN, players will notice that the map immediately acts as if it is its own independent title with cutscenes, menus, and inventive transitions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Campfire, players will play against one another after their plane crashes onto an island. Each player goes through the same trials in hopes of avoiding being eliminated and kicked off the island.

  Card games are still some of the most entertaining ways of passing the time with family and friends. Though there are many different card games to play in person with one another, sometimes it can be difficult.
 </p>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  installed though, friends and family can spend time together with Card Chaos, an
  <em>
   Uno
  </em>
  -like game that allows players to play against one another in first-person. Card Chaos is a simple contest reminiscent of
  <em>
   Uno,
  </em>
  giving gamers a free way of playing cards with each other in a unique platform.

  Artifacts play a major role in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  gameplay when it comes to adding buffs to Skif's stats. The only way to grab an artifact from an anomalous area is by using an artifact detector and reaching the specific point where the artifact will spawn. The whole process of finding an artifact can become tougher or easier depending on the type of artifact detector you're using.
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  currently has four artifact detectors for players to use. This guide explores them in detail, explaining how you can get them.

  Players get the Echo Detector
  <strong>
   at the beginning of
   <em>
    Stalker 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  and use it for a good chunk of the game. It's a small yellow device with a light tube in the middle that strobes when an artifact is in detection range.
 </p>
 <p>
  The s
  <strong>
   trobe and beeping frequency intensifies
  </strong>
  , depending on whether the artifact is close or far away from the player's position. It's a basic artifact detector that gets the job done, but honing in on an artifact can be a bit time-taking.

  Players get the Bear detector either during
  <strong>
   A Sign of Hope side mission
  </strong>
  or from one of the vendors in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . It's an upgrade over the basic Echo Detector as it displays a
  <strong>
   visual indicator
  </strong>
  for the distance between the player and the artifact.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bear artifact detector has rings around its main display that gradually start to light up, depending on how far or close you are to the artifact. Once all rings light up, it means you're right on top of the artifact's location, and it'll successfully spawn.

  that players can get during
  <strong>
   the Mysterious Case side mission
  </strong>
  from Sultan in
  <em>
   Stalker 2

  . It displays numbers that correlate to an artifact's location within an anomalous field. If the numbers start to decrease, it means players are getting close to the artifact and vice versa.

  While there are many types of feathers that you can acquire in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , one of the absolute rarest among them is
  <strong>
   Astral Feathers
  </strong>
  . They can only be gathered from one specific animal in the game - the
  <strong>
   Astral Swan
  </strong>
  . This magnificent bird is found deep within the Abandoned District region of the game, so you'll need to progress far enough into the main story questline to access the area and explore it as thoroughly as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do that, you need to open as many of the Skyways in the Abandoned District as you can, which allow you to use your special Floral Gliding ability to fly from one stonetree island to another. While doing so, you need to also make sure to unlock as many Warp Spires as possible, as that will help immensely with navigating the region in the long run.

 <p>
  The Astral Swan is found on the
  <strong>
   Stellar Fishing Ground
  </strong>
  island in the Abandoned District, as seen above. To reach it, you will need to continue completing main story quests for the region until you reach the centermost island where the Handsome Lads Circus is based. Also make sure to unlock the
  <strong>
   'Handsome Lads Circus' Warp Spire
  </strong>
  while you're there, as that will let you get back to the top of the island easily from now on. Finally, you need to have the
  <strong>
   Floral Gliding ability
  </strong>
  unlocked for Nikki, which by now you should have.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the Warp Spire, go towards the center of the area and then hang a right, where you will find the
  <strong>

  Once you've landed, unlock the
  <strong>
   Stellar Fishing Ground Trail Warp Spire
  </strong>
  , which establishes your first avenue of teleporting to the island, meaning you no longer need to use the Skyway. You'll then need to hoof it all the way up to the summit of the Stellar Fishing Ground. Feel free to do some fishing along the way, as this is also the only place in the game where you can catch the elusive
  <strong>
   Tulletail Fish
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure to keep your Floral Gliding ability equipped, as you need to use the leaf jump pads and flower geyers to reach the top-most area of the island. Soon, you should reach the Stellar Fishing Ground Peak, which is a tranquil grassy area with a small pond and also happens to be the nesting area of the Astral Swan. Unlock the Warp Spire there and speak to the Piecey named
  <strong>
   Curious Pinny

  <strong>
   'Soaring Above the Starry Sky'

  quest.

  This will formally introduce you to the Astral Swan itself, and its objectives also involving grooming the mythical creature, which will give you Astral Feathers in return. The rest of the quest involves using your Floral Gliding ability to fly alongside the Astral Swan, which is a truly special moment in the game. Be aware that if you need multiple Astral Feathers, similar to the Bullquet in Breezy Meadow, you will need to wait at least 24 hours between each grooming session for the opportunity to "reset".
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, don't be shy about taking subsequent flights with the Astral Swan, as your Daily Wishes may include a special request to fly alongside it, and that can reward you with
  <strong>
   Silver Petals
  </strong>
  . If you're looking to craft the Silvergale's Aria Miracle Outfit, you're going to need several of those.

  Ask any anime fan what they'd imagine when they hear "ninja" and it's likely going to be
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In fact, the orange-clad protagonist of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  franchise created quite an indelible mark in both anime and mainstream media. Aside from the meme-worthy "Naruto run" and the series' impressive storyline, fans also remember
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  for its slate of action-packed games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  eventually grew alongside the franchise. For instance, some hit
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  titles followed notable arcs when the series was ongoing. As such,
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  has more than 50 titles across different game series! However, just which
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  dominate the rest? Most importantly, which titles should
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fans definitely try?
 </p>

   <strong>
    Updated on January 5, 2025, by Rhenn Taguiam:
   </strong>
   As events in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex revealed more details of what happened to Naruto’s son during the sequel’s time skip, fans of the series might be surprised to learn that not only did Himawari Uzumaki become the new Nine-Tails Jinchuriki, but that many of the cast have fallen victim to Sapient Beings - God Trees who obtained sentience. With Boruto aided by an unlikely ally during this seemingly impossible quest, fans who are excited to read the next Boruto chapter might want to play some Naruto games instead. Among must-recommended titles include an attempt to switch up the current franchise, as well as making a connection between Naruto and Boruto in a unique manner.

  Prior to the arrival of the critically-acclaimed
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
  </em>
  was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
   </em>
  </strong>
  - which at the time not only featured a completely new story featuring Mecha Naruto and backstories of the Akatsuki but also revamped mechanics that would be refined in future entries. Introduced in the game are Guard Breaks and Counters - both of which can elevate the player’s approach to defense. Teams can now be formed based on skills, giving players new ways of making their dream setups.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps one of the most controversial entries in the franchise,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
  </em>
  has introduced quite a lot of mechanics that didn’t seem to be polished - something players have become disappointed in at the time of its release. The lackluster World Ninja Tournament combined a lot of the elements of the previous game’s Horde Mode and a splash of QTEs that made the game mode rather underwhelming, while players easily getting their opponents stuck into 5-second stuns with Counters can open online matches to a world of unfair fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Compared to other
  <em>
   Storm
  </em>
  games where mechanics are often carried over and improved in the next title,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
  </em>
  ups the ante with its new mechanics under the hopes of reinvigorating new life into the franchise. Although fans appreciate the tiered-based brawlers of the World Ninja Tournament and the endearing stories of Mecha Naruto and Ninja Adventures, the former’s overwhelming setup made for quite the underwhelming offline mode. And while Team Ultimates raise the bar in terms of stunning visuals, the sheer abusability of Counters on top of combat-limiting Ultimate or Awakening choices can lock players into unfair attack loops or unexpected “boss” fights against opponents who can use larger “special” Awakening Modes.

  Being the most recent entries in the franchise, it’s no surprise that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
   </em>
  </strong>
  has some of the flashiest effects and finest level of detail in the franchise. The new Combat Automation feature allows players to customize how much of the fights they want their characters to automate, giving them room for more casual experiences - especially if they’re after the story. This mechanic won’t help much in more intense online matches, however, as the game’s straightforward gameplay can lead to a wild online experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  While touted as a celebration of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  ’s legacy,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
  </em>
  doesn’t make use of its expanded cast and
  <em>
   Boruto
  </em>
  ’s potential to its fullest. Teasing a return of Naruto and Sasuke’s “rivalry” in the Special Story didn’t live up to its implications, and Boruto’s entrance in an exclusive story doesn’t inspire in the same way a celebratory game like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  has done. This, combined with the game’s largely unchanged mechanics, did make
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Connection
  </em>
  feel rather lackluster as a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  As a game that “hands off” the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  legacy from Naruto Uzumaki to his son Boruto, it makes sense for
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
  </em>
  to feature not just a recap of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  ’s whole history but an exclusive game mode where Boruto and his peers attempt to stop an impending Fifth Ninja War from an in-universe MMO. The game is faithful to its mechanics from its previous entries, with newcomers from
  <em>
   Boruto
  </em>
  adding a flavorful spin to the game’s fast-paced combat. Unfortunately, the History Mode’s lack of visual flair and the Special Story’s lack of “oomph” with a solid story does make the game feel rather boring.

  While many of the games in the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  series offer a deeper look into Naruto’s long journey to becoming the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Ninja Council 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a familiar route with its parent series of games and focuses on high-octane ninja battles. Featuring a cast of almost 30 characters from the first part of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  anime,
  <em>
   Ninja Council 3
  </em>
  gives players an arena platformer fighter similar to the
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  franchise, allowing the likes of Naruto to team up or even fight against other popular characters in the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to other games in
  <em>
   Ninja Council
  </em>
  , the third installment uses much of the same sprites but updates mechanics using the Nintendo DS’s touch mechanics. This time around, certain techniques have to be tapped via the second screen or even completed via extremely short mini-games, adding a level of suspense when doing this in mid-combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Players often criticize its lack of a story mode and rather repetitive missions, but its multiplayer mode is worth a shot for those who want to accomplish various objectives as a team or duke it out against each other. While not necessarily an acclaimed title, fans of the franchise who want to get a taste of what
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  in the DS was like should at least try
  <em>
   Ninja Council 3
  </em>
  for the change of pace in gameplay.

  When players look for a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  , they often encounter
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  . However, before the 3D arena fighter took the world by storm (no pun intended), this iconic series of games within the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  franchise had humble beginnings with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Ultimate Ninja
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Given its early 2000s release,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  covers the introductory saga of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  story up until Orochimaru’s invasion of the Hidden Leaf, ending in Naruto and Sasuke’s first fateful encounter atop the Valley of the End.
 </p>
 <p>
  What’s interesting about the title is specifically its approach to the story, as its retelling of the rather short
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  arcs is supplemented with perspectives of other characters. On top of this focus on character stories, the combat mechanics are repetitive but equally enjoyable, giving players straightforward basic and special attacks that they combine with the D-Pad to launch unique techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  This PlayStation 2 title is the first in the franchise to have Naruto and his friends in full-3D battles, and is also the first entry that would eventually branch into the more popular
  <em>
   Storm
  </em>
  sub-series of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  . This is also the first game to utilize accessible mechanics that make the game easier to pick up and play, making this an ideal introduction for fans of the franchise.

  Fans of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  franchise looking for a decent brawler after the abysmal experience with
  <em>
   Ninja Council 3
  </em>
  can still enjoy playing with their Nintendo DS courtesy of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This 2008 release is a decent button masher that rightfully demonstrates the visual splendor of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  series in a portable console, offering a focus on one-on-one battles instead of its short but rather dull story mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, the game does offer a more fun
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  experience for the Nintendo DS. Sans the tendency of the touch controls to be unresponsive at times, being able to access a myriad of jutsu with just a touch of a button can make
  <em>
   Ninja Destiny 2
  </em>
  a game that fully uses the DS’s hardware system. Despite the basic button-mashing mechanics, the fluidity of the animation can almost excuse the repetitive attacking motions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Although not necessarily aimed toward fighting game purists,
  <em>
   Ninja Destiny 2
  </em>
  is a solid experience for fans of the franchise who just want a portable brawler for their Nintendo DS. Being able to access around 20+ characters with unique techniques plus a Survival Mode that pits them against an endless assault of characters can lead to hours’ worth of button-mashing satisfaction.

  It’s not often that a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  is balanced, especially with the emphasis on button mashing courtesy of its straightforward mechanics. However,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  shines with its nature as a decently balanced fighter not just in general but especially for the oftentimes-criticized Wii. Key to the appeal of
  <em>
   Revolution 3
  </em>
  mechanics is the emphasis on precision, with combos requiring specific timing to execute as enemies as well as players can butt in with a perfectly-timed counter or dodge.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the game simply tells the rather short
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  introductory arc up until the Kazekage Retrieval Arc, it’s the versus mode that pits
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  characters against each other where players can have a great time. Being able to use around 40 characters with unique but accessible techniques makes
  <em>
   Revolution 3
  </em>
  one of the
  <strong>
   best-developed
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  of the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Considered the fifth entry of the
  <em>
   Clash of Ninja
  </em>
  series, the game offers 40 playable stages alongside 40 playable characters that have their skill sets overhauled due to the
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  time skip. Moreover, the game features a rather comprehensive set of quality-of-life changes that make it more defense-leaning compared to the traditionally aggressive button-mashing nature of the franchise. It is also the first game in the series to offer Wi-Fi connectivity for online battles.

  Fans of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  series might be surprised to try out
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era
  </em>
  for the Nintendo 3DS. In essence, the game tries to return to the era of 2D side-scrolling adventures. Unfortunately, despite its decent story, the title's overall approach to gameplay seems lackluster and rather so-so for a 2011 title.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, the game takes place in various
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  landmarks with various platforming elements. Moreover, Naruto can perform various attacks and even Jutsu that transitions into a 3D cutscene. Unfortunately, fans who played other immersive
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fighting games won't find this title endearing at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  One of the very few
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  platformers out there, the game does explore the potential of the series in the context of a 2D title. Its prioritization of platforming instead of outright combat adds depth to exploration and more unique ways of using their abilities.

  Interestingly,
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  actually has a game entry for the Wii. Unlike other titles,
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
  </em>
  tries to add RPG elements to the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  concept. As a result, the 2010 title features a new story with elements from the franchise. In essence, the game takes place in a loose version of the Itachi Pursuit Mission. Unique to the game is the antagonist Kuroma Tatsushiro, who plans on using the power of the Genryu (five eternal dragons) for his evil schemes.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result,
  <em>
   Dragon Blade Chronicles
  </em>
  feels more like an action-adventure game with
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  elements. Instead of hand-to-hand combat, Naruto (now adorned in traditional Feudal Japanese armor) uses swords to fight various monsters. Aside from aesthetics, there's not much that makes this game a "genuine"
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Despite criticisms, the game does make an excellent demonstration of what
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  could become in the context of a fantasy RPG. There’s certainly merit in the way the game meshed the series’ signature combat techniques into having different approaches and uses in a fantasy setting.

  Those who want a more strategic take on the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  universe would probably want to check out
  <em>
   Naruto: Shinobi no Sato no Jintori Kassen
  </em>
  , loosely translated as
  <em>
   Naruto: Ninja Village Jintori Battle.
  </em>
  Essentially, the game mixes elements of strategy with light combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main goal is to occupy the home base of the enemy. Much of the game takes place during the first few episodes of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  , particularly when Team 7 has to face the likes of Haku and Zabuza.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Aside from its limited scope,
  <em>
   Ninja Village Jintori Battle
  </em>
  doesn't boast much in terms of mechanics. The board game aspect doesn't immediately fit the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  setting, at least not one so restricted. If it were to involve the other nations and Hidden Villages during the Fourth Shinobi World War, then perhaps such a concept would show promise.

  Fans of the series with their PlayStation Portables intact would likely get intrigued by
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden Legends: Akatsuki Rising
  </em>
  . After all, not only does the game boast full 3D combat, but it also serves as a great introduction to Part II of the series - especially to major villains known as the Akatsuki.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadly, this is as far as the game goes in terms of its flair, as it’s not fun to play in terms of combat. At its core,
  <em>
   Akatsuki Rising
  </em>
  has Naruto explore different zones and eliminate enemies, similar to a Musou game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Battles take place in semi-large environments, but combos are easy to spam and pull off. Moreover, given that the story only takes place from the beginning of Part II until the Kazekage Rescue Mission, there are only 17 playable characters. All-in-all,
  <em>
   Akatsuki Rising
  </em>
  offers a somewhat suboptimal experience.

  People who want to try
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  as a full-blown turn-based RPG might be tempted to try out
  <em>
   Naruto: Path of the Ninja
  </em>
  . This Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS title takes place at the beginning of Part I and runs until the end of the Chuunin Exams, where Naruto faces off against Shukaku. Unlike other
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  titles, this RPG takes a turn-based approach to combat. As such, teams of three (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura for the most part) need to carefully coordinate attacks and jutsu in order to take down a number of foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Naruto: Path of the Ninja
  </em>
  has a small roster of playable characters – including Shikamaru Nara, Neji Hyuga, Rock Lee, and Jiraiya – with a whole host of NPCs and opponents. Sadly, the RPG component does get rid of the fast-paced action component the franchise is known for.
  <em>
   Path of the Ninja
  </em>
  isn't a recommended way to re-experience Part I’s events, considering how other games accomplish the same with more engaging combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Integrating RPG graphics into the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  universe is something
  <em>
   Path Of The Ninja
  </em>
  demonstrates, and it’s certainly quite interesting to see a strategic “conversion” of fast-paced attacks into specially-timed jutsus. Unfortunately, the limited scope of the story does mean there’s a hindrance to the full extent of the RPG title’s potential.

  With
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fans get a taste of
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  if it were a Musou title. As such, fans would immediately notice the similarities between
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Impact
  </em>
  and titles such as
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors.
  </em>
  After all, it's not common that a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  would feature Naruto and his friends facing hundreds upon hundreds of enemies. However, these immense battles remain impressive for a PlayStation Portable title.
 </p>
 <p>
  This 2011 title also tackles
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  's Kazekage Retrieval Mission until the Five Kage Summit, which tackles more than half of the anime's storyline. Unfortunately, the musou format made
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Impact
  </em>
  's gameplay extremely repetitive and uninspired. As such, it lacks the fast-paced and tactical "flair"
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fans enjoy in other games.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Although not as flashy as other titles,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Impact
  </em>
  is a great demonstration of what
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  could be like as a Musou title. It feels delightful to use the “Naruto run” in wide areas to chase down enemies and at the same time make extremely straightforward attacks.

  Fans would consider the PSP's
  <em>
   Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2
  </em>
  as a dividing title. After all, the game is essentially
  <em>
   Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
  </em>
  with three new characters and a new story mode. However, in this title, players now have access to the Mugen Castle Arc. This arc takes them within the Mugen Castle, a haunted castle with randomly generated floors with its own story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike technical fighting games,
  <em>
   Heroes 2
  </em>
  relies on fast-paced combat. Moreover, most of its 23 characters have special modes that make battles more diverse and unpredictable. Unfortunately, game collectors might wonder why even get
  <em>
   Ninja Heroes 2
  </em>
  if all they get are three new characters and an entirely-skippable Mugen Castle Arc. In turn, they may as well get the first
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Heroes
  </em>
  game for a more compact experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Although possessing a limited number of characters due to the limitation with regards to the story,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2
  </em>
  is a great demonstration of the potential of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  as a fighting game title at the time, especially with its simple yet flashy slate of combos.

  Franchise fans who want to bring the excitement of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  to their mobile phones can play
  <em>
   Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Voltage
  </em>
  on iOS and Android. This action-strategy RPG combines MOBA-style action with minor base-building components. Players can organize their “dream team” composed of four characters from both
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Boruto
  </em>
  to take on various missions and challenges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike usual turn-based or tap-action mobile games,
  <em>
   Ninja Voltage
  </em>
  has a more active approach to gameplay. Players control their leader character while the rest of their team follows and supports them. Moreover, players can dish out powerful combos and attacks that feature signature moves such as the Rasengan and the Chidori. Fans who want a compact experience close to the
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  series could find almost the exact gameplay style in
  <em>
   Ninja Voltage
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Despite its rather lukewarm reception,
  <em>
   Ninja Voltage
  </em>
  is arguably one of the more extensive gacha games out there. While it gives players early access to a lot of popular
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  characters on the get-go, it’s up to players to collect special Ninja Cards that allow them to equip these characters with exclusive attacks. This adds a lot of flexibility with regard to how a single shinobi character is built, making each iteration of a character unique.

  Albeit not necessarily an exclusive
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Jump Force
  </em>
  does answer a lot of fan questions regarding an important aspect of powerful fighters. If Naruto and Sasuke could defeat most of the ninjas in their world, how would they fare against the likes of Ichigo, Goku, or even Yami Yugi?
 </p>
 <p>
  In this game, players take on the roles of some of the most prominent characters in Shonen Jump. Of course, given the vast scope of Jump's manga selections, the game offers quite a lot of interesting match-ups. For instance, who could have thought that Light Yagami and his Death Note could face the likes of Naruto and Sasuke? Thanks to this game, players can finally see for themselves how the two shinobi's abilities would fare against some of the most popular manga characters around.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  While there’s not a lot of visible
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  presence in the game, the fact that players can use Naruto to fight some of the most popular
  <em>
   Shonen Jump
  </em>
  characters makes this game a dream come true for fan artists and the like. Power-scalers and theorists will appreciate the arena brawler for its unique application of signature movies within the franchise.

  It could be argued that
  <em>
   Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  gave a preview of the series’s true potential in terms of fast-paced ninja action. In terms of story, the first
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  game covers the events of Part I until Episode 135.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, players can get a more dynamic take on events that thrust Naruto into his journey toward being the Hokage. However, for now, he has to become a Chuunin and help save Sasuke from the impending threat of Orochimaru.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  While retaining the same combo-focused mechanics of the
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  enables players to move in fully 3D environments. As a result, the game offers more dynamic use of Ninja Move dodges, wall-fighting, and different ninja tools, while players can even request help from support ninjas. These mechanics will slowly see improvements and changes throughout the course of the landmark
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  series.

  Fans of classic
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  would love 2007's
  <em>
   Naruto: Rise of a Ninja –
  </em>
  a
  <em>
  </em>
  title that serves as a hallmark title for pre-
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  days. After all, the Xbox 360 title explores the first 80 episodes of the series in a fully-open Konoha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, the main storyline comes with cutscenes interspersed with actual footage from the anime. Additionally, the game slowly teaches players everything Naruto learns in the original story - from using chakra to walk on walls and water (that also opens up the environment) to learning powerful Jutsu they can use in fights. Fans with the Xbox 360 should try this title, as it's one of the first
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  to fully realize an open-world environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  An open-world Konoha is quite an interesting place to explore, especially how it’s been depicted as a lively environment to live in. The component of seeing civilians firsthand and being able to jump around a huge ninja village makes the stakes much higher by the time the likes of Orochimaru have posed a threat to the village.

  Fans of PSP's
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  <em>
   Heroes
  </em>
  series would feel right at home with the PS2's
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden:
  </em>
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja 5.
  </em>
  Due to its ties with the
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  anime, the game's story follows eight chapters related to the Kazekage Retrieval Arc and the reunion with Orochimaru and Sasuke. Interestingly, the game also features most characters with their
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  costumes as well as alternate modes that grant new abilities. Moreover, the game introduces Assist Characters which players can call for aid for extra damage or powerful linked attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  This title easily becomes a must-play for fans who want a portable
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  that packs a lot of content and features. Moreover, it's one of the last 2.5D
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fighting games prior to its transition to full-blown 3D fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Although similar to
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Heroes
  </em>
  in the context that it’s a 2.5D title,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja 5
  </em>
  excels in how it demonstrates the potential of
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  -level characters in this kind of setup. Lacking as it may be in flashier attacks in more open environments, the more confined spaces of the 2.5D landscape make the game feel more tactical and have higher stakes.

  Fans of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  will finally get their personalized Konoha experience with
  <em>
   Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker
  </em>
  . In this 2018 title, fans can explore the first few arcs of the
  <em>
   Boruto
  </em>
  anime – this time with a fully customized avatar. Moreover, the game now features the cast of
  <em>
   Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
  </em>
  , which includes Boruto Uzumaki (Naruto's son) and his friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interestingly, the game boasts a fairly open environment where players can embark on various quests. Moreover, multiplayer matches come in various modes. Additionally, player avatars can possess unique abilities – some of which are signature moves from the original cast. Unfortunately, a lot of gamers don't appreciate
  <em>
   Shinobi Striker
  </em>
  for its repetitive gameplay and lackluster combat mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  Immense customization is the name of the game for
  <em>
   Shinobi Striker
  </em>
  , allowing players to finally be able to meet, team up, and even fight some of the most popular members of the cast. The open-world setting and the vast environments give players a lot of room to experiment with their newfound abilities, making the game quite engaging.

  Fans looking for the ultimate
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  experience would appreciate
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
  </em>
  for the PS3 and Xbox 360. This 2012 title retains the new 3D-based fights of the original
  <em>
   Ninja Storm
  </em>
  title. However, this game cranks everything up to 11 thanks to its fast-paced battles and stories fully covering the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  anime.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, fans would love
  <em>
   Generations
  </em>
  for its high-octane action. For instance, the game now features attack cancels, vertical mid-air dodges, and other cancellations to further diversify the game's approach to combat. Additionally,
  <em>
   Generations
  </em>
  uses Naruto's original story to branch out into other side stories. In turn,
  <em>
   Generations
  </em>
  gleams insights into other characters such as Itachi Uchiha and Minato Namikaze's lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Notable for:
  </strong>
  This serves as a more “complete”
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  experience in the context of the story, especially since it begins anew with Naruto’s childhood until the middle arc of
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  . This story route, alongside new attack additions such as cancellations and the like, can make players feel more engaged in the adventures of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and his friends.

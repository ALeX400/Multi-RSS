   <em>
    Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be coming to PS4 and Xbox One on September 17, 2024. Although it was one of the most anticipated action releases of 2023,
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  had a somewhat troubled launch. The optimization issues on PC and current-gen consoles had fans and critics saying the game was not ready for release, although many of these issues were fixed in patches months later.

 <p>
  PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were both announced for
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  a few months after its release, shocking fans because of the sheer scope of the 140+ GB game. Many gamers assume most new releases can run fine on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series systems, but
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  had trouble across the board with optimization, so a release on older hardware has sounded like more trouble than it's worth. Respawn Entertainment has a chance to prove gamers wrong.

  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  is set for a September 17 release date, EA and Respawn have announced. The game will sell for $49.99, prioritizing optimization to the limited hardware. Additionally, the game's PC version will get a patch that enhances performance and improves quality of life features. Gamers who still aren't ready to make the jump to current-gen tech have voiced their excitement about the release. These fans last heard news about the PS4 and Xbox One releases of
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  when it was rated in Brazil, highlighting that it would be arriving on the systems after all. Soon, these fans will be able to see if the wait was worth it.

 <p>
  There remains some apprehension surrounding this release. Although the game came out in 2023, some critics said it needed at least another year in the oven, and that was for the newer hardware. Some players who experienced
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  when it was riddled with bugs are still skeptical that the PS4 and Xbox One can handle the game without severe drawbacks. Many are curious about whether it will remain as large, and what a change in file size might highlight about changes made to the overall game.

  There's a chance this could end up like the Switch version of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  which had gamers pointing out the drastic discrepancies between face models when shown side by side. This version of
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  will likely sacrifice the high resolution and framerate that newer consoles boast, opting to maximize performance in any area possible. Some gamers are confused as to why last-gen hardware is still being supported four years into the current console cycle, although specialists tend to suggest that the more advanced hardware gets, the less of a gap there may be between each system.

    Updated August 6, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. It was a particularly tough week at Bungie as the studio announced massive layoffs impacting over 200 employees. The announcement left many developers shocked and surprised, while fans expressed anger and disappointment that the studio was again cutting more jobs.

  While there's no getting around the disappointment of people losing their jobs, the machine that is
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  rolls forward. The game has entered its second period of downtime after Act 2 of Episode Echoes, giving players another three weeks to catch up before the third and final piece launches. Alongside the weekly reset, this week will be the start of the annual Solstice event in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , which brings with it new explorer-themed armor sets as well as new weapons that include a combat bow, Compass Rose shotgun, Something New hand cannon, and a strand rocket launcher called Crowning Duologue.

  Alongside all of that, the

  The newly-released
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  console exclusive game
  <em>
   World of Goo 2
  </em>
  is getting great reviews from critics. The Nintendo Switch has a massive library of games, including a ton of multi-platform releases as well as plenty of games that are exclusive or are at least console exclusive on the platform.

  There have already been a couple of highly-rated Switch console exclusive games released this year. Puzzle game

   Lorelei and the Laser Eyes
  </em>
  earned rave reviews from critics when it launched in May, while
  <em>
   1000xRESIST

  proved to be a critical darling as well, with both games standing out as two of the highest-rated new releases of the entire year. For console gamers, the only place to play those games is on Switch, and now there's yet another new Switch console exclusive that fans will want to check out.

  For those who may not be familiar with the game,
  <em>
   World of Goo 2
  </em>
  is a sequel to the 2008 physics-based puzzler
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  . Whereas
  <em>
   World of Goo 2
  </em>
  is a Switch console exclusive, the original
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  was a Wii console exclusive back in the day. The original
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  was praised for many of the same reasons that critics are praising the sequel. The difference is that the original
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  was more innovative and original at the time of its release, standing tall as one of the best WiiWare games ever released for the system.

 <p>
  Nintendo Switch gamers looking for a new puzzle game to play should definitely check out
  <em>
   World of Goo 2
  </em>
  , but they may want to start with the first game. Luckily, the original
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  was ported to the Switch, making it possible for fans to play through both on Nintendo's home console/handheld hybrid. Both games have local co-op support, letting players solve their various puzzles with a friend, and so they may be good picks if anyone needs something to play with a friend. That being said, the single-player touchscreen controls are arguably superior to the Joy-Cons, at least in the original
  <em>
   World of Goo
  </em>
  game, and so fans may want to keep that in mind.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  received its biggest update yet with Escalation of Freedom, releasing an extensive set of patch notes revealing all of the new content, bug fixes, and balancing that has also arrived. After going silent for a couple of months with
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  breaking away from its more frequent updating policies, many fans wondered what was next for the popular online co-op experience. There were no shortage of rumors and leaks regarding new enemies and other gameplay modifiers, some of which turned out to be true once the next big release was announced.

 <p>
  Without much warning, Arrowhead surprised fans towards the end of July by announcing a massive new update for
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  called Escalation of Freedom. With the update, players would be getting tons of new content to refresh the experience, though if that wasn't enough, the studio also confirmed another Premium Warbond launching just 2 days later, giving fans access to new fire-based weaponry and armor. Now, update day has arrived and players can see the full scale of changes Arrowhead has unleashed upon
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  For many fans, the biggest piece of this
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  update is the new content, starting with Difficulty Level 10. For those who want a massive challenge, Super Helldive introduces formidable new enemies and intense challenges that aim to test even the more experienced and hardened player. New Terminids like the Impaler and Spore Charger join Automaton troops like the Rocket Tank and Reinforced Scout Strider to force players to adapt while taking on new mission objectives, dealing with unique environmental hazards, or checking out the newly added swamp planet.

 <p>
  However, new content isn't the only piece to the Escalation of Freedom update, as the patch also introduces extensive bug fixes and balancing adjustments as well. Certain weapons, like the Slugger and Exploding Crossbow have recieved a couple of buffs, while the Breaker Incendiary and Grenade Pistol have seen a few nerfs. The HE Barrage, Walking Barrage, and Guard Dog have also been tweaked slightly, while further gameplay adjustments should make certain frustrating modifiers such as the frequency of Gunship patrols, much more manageable. However, one of the biggest gameplay adjustments is that a new anti-griefing measure has been added into
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , allowing players who are kicked to not only continue but earn the full set of rewards.

 <p>
  Man are hoping the Escalation of Freedom update is the first entry into an interesting rest of 2024 for Helldivers 2. Since the game launched back in February, there have been no shortage of rumors and leaks regarding a third faction which many believe to be the returning Illuminate from the original
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  , though Arrowhead has yet to officially confirm or deny anything. Regardless, this update makes it clear that Arrowhead certainly aims to keep this game alive and well for the forseeable future.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans have recently discussed how large creatures that do not belong to any evolutionary line are born. Some popular Pokemon
  <em>
  </em>
  such as Pikachu have baby versions like the cute Pichu, but many big creatures do not, and this has been a very puzzling question for the community over the years.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise has existed for almost 30 years, spanning several games across nine generations, and 1,025 creatures. These Pokemon come in essentially all sizes and shapes, ranging from small ones like Diglett, Applin, Mimikyu, Shroodle, Joltik, and Togepi, for example, to absurdly huge Pokemon like Steelix, Kyogre, Snorlax, or Exeggutor. All creatures that do not evolve from other monsters are born the same way: they hatch from eggs.

 <p>
  Now, a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan called DodexX_On_Reddit has started an interesting discussion, asking the community how creatures that have an enormous size are born, and wondering how big their eggs would need to be. In their post, the fan uses creatures such as Torkoal, Tropius, and Turtonator as examples, considering that they’re all large, and have no previously known ancestors. This discussion prompted several interesting theories from the community about how Pokemon breed.

 <p>
  One of the most accepted theories was that all eggs were normal-sized, but ended up becoming full-sized Pokemon when they hatched. Fans have noted that in the TV series, eggs do not exactly “hatch” like they would in real life, but glow, and eventually the creature is born. Other fans compared eggs to Poke Balls, claiming that an NPC from
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  described eggs as “cradles” instead of actual eggs, indicating that they would be bigger on the inside.

 <p>
  Another greatly popular theory is that the largest Pokemon without evolutionary lines simply hatch in small sizes from eggs, but the whole process is simplified in the games. One fan cited Kanghaskhan as an example, as the creature generally carries a small baby in its pouch, implying that Kanghaskahn babies exist.

 <p>
  In any case, there’s no official confirmation from Nintendo, so it’s likely that these discussions will continue for a long time. There are some cases in which very heavy Pokemon such as Snorlax eventually gain previous forms, such as when Munchlax was introduced in the fourth generation of Pokemon games, but that’s far from the rule. Hopefully, one day there will be an official explanation for this mystery, but fans should not hold their breaths, as it’s unlikely that it will appear anytime soon.

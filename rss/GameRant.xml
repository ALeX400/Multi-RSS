  Part of Coruscant from
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  has been built in incredible detail in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  due to the efforts of one player.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players often share impressive builds made in the game, and the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  franchise offers excellent subject matter for making eye-catching creations thanks to its many iconic worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the most stunning locales in the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe is Coruscant. The planet was seen at the end of the 1997 Special Edition of
  <em>
   Episode 6: Return of the Jedi
  </em>
  and would become a mainstay of the series, showing up heavily in the prequel films and other media. As a city planet, Coruscant has an iconic appearance, featuring bustling lanes of traffic and enormous superstructures. Notably, the location featured the Jedi Temple, the headquarters for the Jedi during the days of the Republic, and the enormous Senate building, which featured some pivotal scenes in the films and shows.
  <em>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Recreating Coruscant in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  could seem impossible, given its massive scale and number of buildings. However, YouTuber Grazzy was up for the challenge of building the skyline featured in the films. The build was showcased in a video that walked through the creation process, revealing the difficulties of completing the design. According to Grazzy, they made the models 1:2 since the actual size of most buildings seen in the movies was massive. As seen in the video, the Coruscant project featured three central locations: the Jedi Temple, the Executive Building, and the Senate. Each looked strikingly similar to how they appeared in the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  prequel movies and stood out against the surroundings, thanks to their huge scale.

 <p>
  In addition to these iconic buildings, Grazzy filled out the surrounding world with complexes of smaller buildings, making up the surface of the city. It is worth noting that the Axiom mod was utilized to help complete the massive project, allowing the YouTuber to paint large sections of these smaller structures across their
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  world. They also built many skyscrapers, helping to fill in the landscape. When coming up with inspiration for the build, the YouTuber revealed they looked at gameplay from
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  , among other things.

  It is exciting to see fans take on massive projects in the game. While official
  <em>
   Star Wars DLC
  </em>
  for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has been released in the past, community creations can sometimes push the boundaries of what is possible even further. Fortunately, Grazzy provided a world download, giving others the chance to check out their incredible creation for themselves. With so many iconic locations throughout
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  ’ many planets, it will be interesting to see what builds based on the franchise are showcased in the future.

      <title>FromSoftware: Hardest Beast Soulsborne Bosses, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/fromsoftware-hardest-beast-soulsborne-bosses/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Fans of
  <strong>
   FromSoftware
  </strong>
  games like to refer to the developer's collection of titles as part of the
  <em>
   Soulsborne
  </em>
  genre. This is mostly defined by the world and combat design approach that the esteemed Japanese developer takes with their titles and is a mashup of the names of their
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  series.
  <strong>
   Boss fights
  </strong>
  are the main attraction and often serve as the make-or-break point for players looking to see the games through to completion.
 </p>

 <p>
  Many of their games feature bosses that look like animalistic beasts, either serving as caged creatures or tortured souls simply looking for an escape. It's said that nothing's more dangerous than a cornered animal, and many of the beasts FromSoftware forces the player to defeat lend truth to it. These monsters are intimidating to deal with, especially thanks to FromSoftware's incredible work when it comes to animating these foes to be as wild and unpredictable as possible. Players need to focus on the battle at hand and not get comboed into oblivion by
  <strong>
   FromSoftware's hardest beast bosses
  </strong>
  that have become legendary battles.

   The Soulsborne universe is full of different challenging enemies that put players' skills to the test at every turn. Although some are humanoid and normal in size, others are much larger and have bestial qualities that make them formidable. Beast enemies have been around the Soulsborne universe since the early days of the most popular franchises within it, so it makes sense that they keep making appearances with every new installment that's released. In some instances, their size is just a psychological element that developers use to trick players into thinking that they're up for a huge challenge, even when they're not. However, in others, the challenge is there.

  Father Gascoigne is the boss who lets players know that
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is a completely different beast compared to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . The combat demands that players are aggressive, and people who fail to get out of their defensive mindset will be punished by Father Gascoigne, especially when it comes to the second phase.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first phase of this boss is fairly manageable. Players are able to inflict a decent amount of damage on this hunter, even if they're on the back foot. However, once he transforms into a beast, trying to hide behind tombstones won't work. Gascoigne will rip and tear through these obstacles, sending players back to the Hunter's Lamp over and over until they understand that the best way to counter this aggression is to stay on the offensive and perfect their dodges.

  Humans are afraid of many different things, but among the most common fears shared by all is that of spiders.
  <em>

  decided that having players fight an iron-clad eight-legged freak known as Armor Spider would be a neat surprise. This fight, due to it taking place in a mining shaft, feels claustrophobic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The limited space makes it so timing and patience are key to overcoming both the webs and firebombs the giant spider has at its disposal. Finding a comfortable rhythm, taking what the openings provide, and not getting greedy can change an insufferable encounter into a dance of death.

  Players who are still getting used to
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  's frenetic combat will find the Blood-Starved Beast to be an absolute pain to deal with. The only respite they have here is that this boss is optional, meaning that players won't have to deal with this abomination if they don't want to. Still, the reward of being able to access the Chalice Dungeon makes this beast worth taking on, with its flayed skin serving as a cloak of sorts that makes the beast even more harrowing to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should make it a point to add an antidote to their quick-use slot if they don't want to waste precious Blood Vials trying to heal any poison damage that this beast inflicts as the battle rages on. As long as players have their dodges timed to perfection and nail the countershot window, they should be able to take out this ultra-aggressive boss that punishes any Hunter who stays on the back foot, which is a statement that can be used to describe almost every foe in this challenging game.

  was a mixed bag for many fans. Many players felt that FromSoftware added way too many bosses to the game. As a result, the pacing of the game suffered, and a lot of bosses became unfair mob battles that weren't all that stimulating and made these encounters more annoying than awe-inspiring.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Duke's Dear Freja is one such boss who can be irritating for this reason alone. On its own, the boss may not be that much of a challenge, which is why players also have to deal with numerous small spiders that can eat into their health bar if they're not careful enough. Thankfully, players can always equip a torch to scare these enemies into submission, letting them focus on the main boss instead.

  <em>
   Bloodborne

  starts off with elements of gothic horror before showing its Lovecraftian influences as players slowly uncover the mysteries of this world. A great way this title creates its unsettling atmosphere is the Lesser Amygdalas that players can see hanging about in 'safe' areas like the Grand Cathedral, either after defeating Rom or attaining enough Insight.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players decide to tackle the optional area of the Nightmare Frontier, then they'll have to deal with the area boss at the end — an Amygdala. This boss can be tricky to damage, as its second phase starts with the creature ripping off two of its arms to extend the reach of its attacks. That's pretty metal and also horrifying. The Defiled Chalice version of this boss is one of the toughest encounters in the entirety of
  <em>
   Bloodborne.

  <em>
   Dark Souls,
  </em>
  Lud and Zallen in
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  are the token clone 2-for-1 boss fight in that FromSoftware title. Sure, fighting two giant sabertooth cats is tough enough on its own, but the part of the fight most players complain about is how poorly designed, and miserable everything leading up to the showdown is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like with most handicap boss fights, it's best to focus on one of the two in an effort to remove the advantage as soon as possible. In the case of the King's Pets, it's advised to rush down Lud and lower their health as much as possible before Zallen joins and changes the whole dynamic.

  Black Blade Kindred is a recurring boss in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , twice in the game. In the end-game, with a level 100-150 character, these bosses are a joke, but they can seem to be insurmountable obstacles in the early game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Owing to
  <em>
   Elden Ring’s
  </em>
  open-world design, it’s possible to stumble across a Black Blade Kindred before they are ready to face it. They have devastatingly fast attacks, deceptively long reach, and can fly to close distances. With high enough DPS and tanking ability, it’s possible to brute force these fights, but they are death sentences for glass cannon builds.

  While most players are used to boss fights against two enemies in the
  <em>
   Soulsborne
  </em>
  games now, there's no denying that most people were taken by surprise when they tried to ring one of the two bells to open the door to Sen's Fortress, only to encounter a Bell Gargoyle that stood in their way. The boss fight seemed simple enough despite the Gargoyle's tricky attacks, but things got really serious when another foe joined the fray.
 </p>
 <p>
  What follows is a chaotic boss fight where players must learn how to juggle both bosses and try not to be taken by surprise while they focus on one foe. To make things worse, players can fall off from the boss arena, meaning that players can't just panic roll to avoid the attacks of these bosses. Doing so will lead to an embarrassing death that punishes players for being too wild and not having any positional awareness.

  Very rarely in games like
  <em>
   Dark Souls, Elden Ring, or Bloodborne
  </em>
  do players regret their actions in the heat of battle. Many of the challenges they face are meant to end with the player feeling a sense of accomplishment. That's hard to do with a boss like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  's Vicar Amelia.
 </p>
 <p>
  This giant deer-like transformation will pull no punches in the small boss arena it calls home and isn't afraid to let the player know their attacks are inflicting pain. With each successful attack, not only will players see Vicar Amelia's health bar lower, but they'll be met with a sickening cry. It's a reminder that even though beasts can present as apathetic nightmare machines, they feel agony and despair all the same.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast
  </strong>
  is one of the most challenging enemies in the entirety of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , as it's a much more powerful version of the other
  <em>
   Fallingstar Beasts
  </em>
  that players will encounter throughout their playthrough. This particular enemy can be found at the top of Mt. Gelmir and it has a very large health pool for the part of the game where players have to face it. Making this boss optional was a great choice by FromSoftware, as it can be really difficult to defeat, and it would have been frustrating to have it be part of the mandatory requirements to progress through The Lands Between. That said, it's not recommended for players to skip it, as it yields great rewards, including 21,000 Runes, 1x Somber Smithing Stone (6), 1x Smithing Stone (6), and the Fallingstar Beast Jaw weapon, which can be great for Strength builds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, there's a Site of Grace near its boss arena, which makes the challenge of getting to it much less daunting, especially considering that players will most likely have to face it several times before emerging victorious. The Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast is strong against Standard, Slash, Strike, and Piercing damage and is also immune to Hemorrhage and Frostbite. However, it’s weak to Magic, Fire, Lightning, and Holy attacks, so players struggling with it in excess might want to try those types of elemental damage to bring it down.

 <p>
  Typically, the final boss fight in a FromSoftware title has the most pomp and circumstance, operating in a very grandiose manner. For
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , that moment happens when the player comes upon Radagon of the Golden Order in his closed-off arena. Those who manage to overcome and defeat this lightning-wielding god among men will then have to take on a semi-transparent reptilian entity known as the Elden Beast.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fight is more frustrating than it is difficult, as the boss will retreat and use long-range attacks in order to gain an advantage over the player.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fans wouldn't have been so harsh on this fight if it preceded the encounter with Radagon instead of following it.

 <p>
  Metyr, Mother of Fingers is an optional secret boss in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC
  </em>
  , which can be encountered during the Count Ymir Questline in the secret chamber underneath the throne in the Cathedral of Manus Metyr.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metyr is a troubling boss to deal with, not because she is especially hard, but because she is different from most other
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  bosses. She can summon minions, has bright AoE explosions that take up the entire screen, and has the ability to summon a literal black hole in the sky that shoots laser beams. The key to beating Metyr is understanding her attacks' true range and outdistancing them instead of dodging or blocking.

  Most people who encounter the Watchdog of the Old Lords when they delve into the Chalice Dungeons for the first time won't really understand why people consider this boss to be one of the hardest in the series. While this first encounter is pretty easy as long as players dodge the boss' well-telegraphed attacks, things take a turn for the worse when players encounter the souped-up version present in the Defiled Chalices.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a health bar that's shaved in half, players must avoid pretty much every attack from this boss if they don't want to be one-shot by its attacks. It's a true test of patience that's just a taste of things to come, with the Defiled Chalices being some of the hardest dungeons to complete in the game simply because of their lower pool of health.

  As with many game developers, FromSoftware has a history of repeating some design elements or choices from game to game. One such case is having the player face off against two copies of the same boss at the same time. Most fans of Soulsborne games will point to the Gargoyles in the first
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  as the first form of this, but it was actually the Maneater fight in
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  where this cruel joke was established.
 </p>
 <p>
  They move in such a sporadic manner, and it doesn't help that they'll often fly into the air and hang out for a bit. Add to this that the entire fight takes place on a narrow bridge with little railing, so the chance of getting knocked off into the abyss is way too high.

  <strong>
   Oceiros, the Consumed King
  </strong>
  is one of the scariest bosses in the entirety of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3,
  </em>
  as it has a very peculiar design and his voice acting is excellent, conveying the pain and suffering that his madness continuously puts him through. He can be found in the Consumed King's Garden, which can be accessed through Lothric Castle after defeating the Dancer of the Boreal Valley near the end of the game. Not only is getting to him very challenging due to all the dangers along the way, but his second phase is extremely fast, as he drops his bipedal stance and fully transforms into the beast he truly is. Defeating him will grant players 58,000 Souls, as well as the Soul of Consumed Oceiros.
 </p>
 <p>
  He is weak to Lightning and Frost, resistant to Magic and Bleed and immune to Poison and Toxic. This is why a lightning-infused weapon like the Dragonslayer Greataxe can be a great choice against him if players progress through Lothric Castle until they defeat the Dragonslayer Armour boss and want to go back to fight Oceiros.

  Boss fights in FromSoftware games where the twist or evolution of the fight comes out of nowhere tend to be the ones that stick with players long after they've rolled credits. Despite
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  having dozens of spectacular showdowns, when players come across the Beast Clergyman, it feels like a moment of culmination.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who manage to overcome the vicious and primal aggression of the Beast Clergyman will be rewarded with the reveal of it being Maliketh, the Black Blade in disguise. The second phase keeps the aggression but morphs it into an attacking style that is much more fluid and timed in a way to catch the player off guard.

  The Guardian Ape fight in
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  is arguably the game's most memorable. After players defeat the ape and celebrate, the giant beast rises from the dead, and the second phase of the fight begins against a headless version of the giant primate. This boss fight happens to be one of the harder challenges in
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  simply because players don't see the second phase coming.
 </p>
 <p>
  FromSoftware is as brutal as they are talented, and they thought it'd be fun to add an optional fight later in the game where players must not only take on the Headless Guardian Ape but do so while also fighting a female ape that presents itself as the original ape's companion.

   <em>
    Dark Souls 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game that served as a great conclusion to one of the best gaming trilogies of all time. The game may have been a bit too linear for some people, but players who forgave the title for its rudimentary level design enjoyed a truly great game with a faster combat system, excellent lore additions, and some callbacks to the first game that was truly impressive in every way.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first DLC for the game,
  <em>
   Ashes of Ariandel
  </em>
  , didn't receive the warmest reception from fans, who weren't huge fans of the expansion's mediocre content. Thankfully,
  <em>
   The Ringed City
  </em>
  made up for the first DLC's defects by adding a wondering area for players to explore, full to the brim with great additions to the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  lore and ending with a boss fight against one of the best enemies in the game, Slave Knight Gael. This enemy fights like a beast early on before becoming more human-like in his approach, and his new moveset is a genuine treat to witness.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Bayle the Dread is one of the biggest optional bosses in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC
  </em>
  , found at the very peak of the Jagged Peak mountains in the eastern section of the map. Bayle’s fight is a spectacle and a pain to muscle through, especially for players without an excellent dragon-slaying weapon like the Dragon-Hunter’s Great Katana.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bayle breathes fire and red lightning, and has multiple AoE attacks that are hard to dodge and require learning his moveset. To make this fight easier, it’s possible, and even recommended, to summon Igon during this boss fight, which can be done by completing his questline. Igon is great at taking Bayle’s attention away from the player and deals damage from range, though his DPS is not very impressive.

  After

  DLC turned out to be one of the greatest expansions ever released for a game, players were hyped to see what
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  's DLCs brought to the table. However, while
  <em>
   Ashes of Ariandel
  </em>
  was engaging in its own right, there's no denying that the boss encounters featured in this additional piece of content felt rather tame in comparison to what FromSoftware had shown before.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this changed with
  <em>
   The Ringed City
  </em>
  DLC, which satiated most players' demands for a great piece of DLC for
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  . An optional boss in this expansion pack that would hurt and humiliate players over and over again is Darkeater Midir, a truly daunting boss fight that will make players beg for the torture to end as he continues to stomp and decimate many unlucky Ashen Ones over and over again.

 <p>
  While many would think that Family Recipes could only be created and passed down by an older Sim, that is not the case; as long as Sims are able to practice the Cooking Skill, they can come up with a Family Recipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To create a Family Recipe in
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
   , players must interact with a refrigerator or oven, enter the Family Recipes menu, and select "Create a Family Recipe". Players have to select a base recipe, a secret ingredient, and a Special Touch
  </strong>
  . Then, once done, they must name it and confirm. This will create a unique recipe with a meal effect that will positively affect whoever consumes it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a Family Recipe has been created, Sims can teach it to another member of the household. Unfortunately, this means that they cannot pass down Family Recipes to any other family members unless they're added to the household.

   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Even if a Sim is not old enough to cook or hasn't learned the Cooking Skill yet, they will be able to retain how to cook the Family Recipe and prepare it in the future.

  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing: New Horizons
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has put together an incredible medieval-style castle town on their island that's drawing attention from the community at large. Those who want to take a closer look to learn how they did it or who just want to visit an adorable locale will be glad to know that the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  builder has shared a Dream Address.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  fans expressed disappointment when the update support for the game came to an end. Despite the explosive popularity of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , the game received content updates for less than two years. While this discontinuation has stymied some attempts to build and create due to a lack of new items being added to the game, many players continue coming up with impressive creations with what's available to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  player Kp-crossing has shared the impressive medieval-style design they came up with for their island. The island, dubbed Rosafaye, features earthy walkways, cobblestone paths and bridges, wooden shacks, and plenty of minor decorations like ducks, rabbits, and mushrooms. Perhaps the most impressive part of the build is the medieval town's castle, complete with two sets of armor acting as guards on either side of the entrance. Interested players can visit it with the Dream Address
  <strong>
   DA-3235-6570-2903

  Numerous fellow fans have expressed how impressed they are with Kp-crossing's island, with the castle in particular drawing attention. Fans have said that the island design reminds them of
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . Others were pleased that the creator shared their Dream Address code, and promised to visit their island as soon as they could. From the sounds of it, players are looking forward to exploring the island and getting more inspiration for their own builds.

  While many would have appreciated an extension of the official support for
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , it's clear that players are still capable of making some incredible things with the tools at their disposal. It's not the only game in the franchise that's still seeing new creations from fans, with
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete
  </em>
  players also regularly sharing their ideas and builds. Fans of the original
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp
  </em>
  mobile title only have a few months left to transfer their saves into the
  <em>
   Complete
  </em>
  version. What the future holds for the series is unclear at this time, though players will likely be able to keep playing
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  on the Nintendo Switch 2.

  One of the most crucial parts of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  and its gameplay is collecting materials from the monsters that you decide to hunt. While every monster can have their own version of various types of materials, some can be a little more specific in terms of where their source is from.

 <p>
  These specific items can relate to a unique trait of a monster that others may not have. For example, a monster that is capable of harnessing lightning, like Rey Dau, will not drop certain materials that can be found in fire-based monsters, like Nu Udra. These items come in multiple forms, with one specifically being called a
  <strong>
   Thunder Sac.
  </strong>
  If you're struggling to find Thunder Sac drops in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds,

  this guide is here to help.

  A Thunder Sac is an item that is required if players are looking to craft certain pieces of gear. Its source comes from the
  <strong>
   Guardian Fulgur Anjanath
  </strong>
  , a returning monster that falls under a new category called Constructs as opposed to its
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
  </em>
  iteration. This monster can be hunted in
  <strong>
   The Ruins of Wyveria
  </strong>
  after discovering it in the
  <strong>
   endgame once players reach high rank, specifically HR 8
  </strong>
  . When hunting this monster in the open world, it tends to be found around
  <strong>
   Zones 9-14
  </strong>
  . If you see it in the wild and wish to hunt it another time, you can interact with its icon and spend Guild Points to save it to your Investigations quest list. There are also optional hunt quests that feature this monster, along with the endgame mission
  <strong>
   called
  </strong>
  "
  <strong>
   Thundering Flowers,"
  </strong>
  which can be replayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , there are specific ways for players to obtain materials during any hunt, with some having to be executed properly for them to count. They include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Quest rewards upon a successful hunt
  </li>
  <li>
   Breaking parts of a monster during the hunt
  </li>
  <li>
   Destroying wounds that appear on the monster's body during a fight
  </li>
  <li>
   Carving the monster once it is successfully hunted
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Competing each of these actions will reward players with more items. However,
  <strong>
   a Thunder Sac can
  </strong>
  <strong>
   only be obtained from quest rewards once the hunt is completed
  </strong>
  . The other methods do still grant materials from Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, but none of them include this specific item in their individual loot pools. Its drop rate from quest rewards sits at
  <strong>
   18 percent
  </strong>
  for each successful hunt, with the odds of obtaining them going down if a player faints during the hunt, resulting in a decrease in quest rewards overall. Obtaining multiple Thunder Sacs per hunt is possible, and players can identify the item by its pouch icon, similar to the Lifepowder item, with a yellow color. To further raise the odds of a Thunder Sac dropping, players can use Lucky Vouchers before departing on the hunt to increase how many quest rewards are given. Once a Thunder Sac is obtained, it can then be used to craft certain pieces of gear, including Guardian Fulgur Anjanath's weapons and armor.

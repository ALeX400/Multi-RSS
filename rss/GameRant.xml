  Although it's still a ways off from its official launch date, it seems some players have gotten copies of the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  remake early. The early arrival has left some fans envious and a bit frustrated as they wait for their own copies of
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  to arrive.

  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  's Bloober Team remake is finally almost here, after years of suspense.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is one of the most-loved entries in the original Konami series, and remaking it was never going to be an easy process when it comes to satisfying everyone. Gamers are more eager than ever to try out the title for the first time, and it seems that some have already had that opportunity land in their lap.

 <p>
  A Reddit user by the name of ConflictConscious665 and several others across multiple social media sites have reported that a copy of the game arrived early. Prior to deleting their post, ConflictConscious665 explained that their friend had gotten a copy of the game early, and provided several screenshots documenting it. The screenshots appeared to be legitimate, but the post has since been taken down due to concerns about backlash from Konami or Bloober Team for breaking the release date. ConflictConscious665 wasn't sure how their friend got the game early, but sometimes, games get shipped as soon as they arrive in warehouses, potentially making it to the customer too soon.

  Premature Silent Hill 2 Release Excites and Frustrates Fans
 </h2>
 <p>
  As the actual release date for
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is rapidly approaching, this early leak has many fans excited. Several requested more information how the game played and whether it was living up to expectations and the original. ConflictConscious665's friend compares it to the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake, which fans have taken as a good sign, considering how praised that remake was. In terms of length, the player had spent about 8 hours in the title and was 39% of the way through, which seems to match claims regarding how long the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake is.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, some fans were understandably upset that others were getting a chance to play the game earlier than intended.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  's official release date is October 8, so the game has arrived for some players a full week early. However, the main reason fans are upset is because the more expensive pre-ordered version of the game gives players access two days early. For those who have already paid more for the privilege, seeing another gamer get a chance long before that window seems unfair. Unfortunately, there's nothing those fans can do now but wait a bit longer.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy

  series is full to the brim with familiar monsters that players will encounter across each game's epic storyline. This stretches to superbosses too.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  was a mess when it launched, but Square Enix didn't give up on their flagship franchise. They continued to patch and update this title until it was up to par with the quality standards of this long-running JRPG series. This culminated in the release of the
  <em>
   Royal
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Windows
  </em>
  editions of the game, which are jam-packed with content while improving some of the most criticized portions. This includes the expanded Insomnia Ruins at the end of the game, featuring a superboss that will force players to fall on their knees.

  While exploring this area, players can stumble upon the toughest enemy in the game, Omega. This war mech is a force to be reckoned with, nullifying almost every type of damage in the game barring Light and Lightning. Players are forced to use Royal Arms that sap Noctis' HP. This can be a tricky balancing act, since Omega's standard attacks hit for massive damage and his offensive repertoire increases once his health falls below 50%. Players must bring a decent stock of restoratives and dodge at regular intervals to stand a chance of beating this fearsome foe.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  was graced with two DLCs after launch, with
  <em>
   Echoes of the Eye
  </em>
  leading to a final encounter against none other than Omega itself. This boss fight takes place across two phases. The first encounter is tough but relatively straightforward, as long as players are smart about dodging attacks and picking their attack windows. However, it's after players defeat Omega that things get serious. This machine uses the Mothercrystal's aether to transform into Omega Aionios.

  This is one of the toughest foes in the game, and is arguably stronger than Ultima. Players must dodge its fiery attacks, use Titanic Block to prevent melee attacks from wiping Clive out, and stagger this enemy at regular intervals to deal a ton of damage. The action-heavy focus of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  's combat system, coupled with a decent stack of restoratives, makes this fight more than doable. Still, the difficulty of this encounter makes it a daunting challenge that only the most adept players can stand a chance of defeating.

  The updated re-release of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  came with a bunch of extra content, including four bonus dungeons that house some of the toughest content in the game. This includes the Lifespring Grotto, a dungeon notorious for featuring two of the game's hardest bosses, which can wipe out an unprepared party in no time. One of these is a version of Omega with defenses so ridiculously high that players will be staring at a Game Over screen in no time unless they follow an apt strategy.

 <p>
  Thunder-element magic is a must to deal damage against this foe, and physical attackers must buff themselves to kingdom come if they wish to stand a chance. It's a lengthy, punishing battle where players must rely on a mix of offensive and support magic to come out victorious. Some of Omega's attacks are so powerful that a party member can be downed in a single hit, adding to the frustrations experienced during this battle.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12
  </em>
  is full to the brim with some of the toughest bosses ever seen in a JRPG, so it's saying something that this game's version of Omega can wipe out a max-level party in no time. The steps involved to unlock this superboss fight in the first place are complicated enough as is, and players must utilize a well-optimized strategy to stand a chance of defeating this mimic. Despite having an attack pattern that may be easy to cheese, players must stay on top of their party's actions at all times if they don't want to be decimated by this foe.

  Without Protect or Wither, the laser beam this boss shoots continuously will wipe out a party member in two hits. Along with this, Omega Mark XII has the annoying habit of inflicting Berserk, which can disrupt the flow of combat. Players must ensure that their party members constantly cycle position so that no person is standing near Omega for too long while using high-level equipment and magic. It's the only wan to defeat a superboss that can be unbelievably frustrating.

 <p>
  For a superboss with such an enduring legacy in the series, it's surprising to see that the first appearance of Omega was in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 5
  </em>
  . Squaresoft pulled no punches when designing this boss encounter, giving Omega high defenses and evasion to make the simple act of inflicting damage on this mechanical foe a Herculean feat. To make things worse, Omega spams Wave Cannon, an attack that deals damage equal to half of the party's maximum HP. This makes it important to maintain high HP levels at all times.

 <p>
  Along with this, Omega has the annoying habit of ejecting a party member from battle at random intervals if players use too many attacks on this foe. Having to deal with this encounter with three party members is a nightmare, and two or fewer is impossible. Not only must players figure out a reliable way to deal damage to Omega because of its high evasion, but they must also maximize their DPS with each blow to ensure that their best damage dealers aren't thrown out of battle.

  Since its inception, the
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization
  </em>
  franchise has been one of the biggest name in 4X games. Across six different mainline titles and multiple spin-offs, Firaxis has continued to give players a thrilling adventure through history, with the upcoming
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization 7
  </em>
  being one of the biggest titles to date. Because of its success, it is easy to see why other studios want to deliver their own similar experience. And Oxide Games has done just that with

  Announced back in 2022,
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold

  is following in the footsteps of the
  <em>

  franchise by letting players forge their own path throughout history. They once again take on a civilization, guide it through multiple eras, and hopefully make their mark on the world before they are taken out. But, while that core gameplay loop can be fun, the way

  begins, players are given a starting city and must build out from there. They must train a scout to explore their surroundings, start construction on some useful buildings within their city, and begin their first research. Then, they hit the next turn button, sit back, and wait until their current projects are done. And once they are, they do it all over again.

  As players progress further into the game, they will encounter other civilizations, tribes, and dangerous animals roaming the land. If they want to survive in this world, they will have to do their best to keep their neighbors friendly or be prepared for some grueling wars and devastation. Additionally, they must be careful not to fall behind in the technology tree, or they risk vanishing off the face of the world forever.

  While this gameplay loop is not too different from what has come before, it is still extremely satisfying in
  <em>

  . It feels like Oxide Games understood what makes titles like
  <em>

  </em>
  tick, so it chose not to change it too much. That being said, there are a few unique mechanics that do keep things a bit fresh, yet also a bit frustrating at times.

  Ara: History Untold Injects a Few Intriguing Mechanics Into its Cities
 </h2>
 <p>
  One of the biggest changes in
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  is the way that cities grow. Instead of waiting for the city to claim hexes by itself, once a city increases its tier, players are prompted to claim a new parcel of land. Each surrounding plot has its benefits and drawbacks, so players will want to plan accordingly to ensure their city has everything it needs. Then, after claiming said land, they are able to construct various improvements to help their civilization thrive.

 <p>
  These improvements come in the form of different buildings, and since there are no builders here, it is also where players build things like farms or mines. Additionally, these buildings do far more than simply provide a background bonus. Instead, they actually require players to craft various resources, similar to the likes of the
  <em>
   Anno
  </em>
  series. These resources can then help give cities bonuses if applied as amenities, or they may be required as part of a building project.

 <p>
  However, the sky is not the limit when it comes to these buildings. In fact, each parcel of land actually has a pre-determined number of buildings that can be constructed within it. So, players will want to ensure they are using their space wisely, because once the slots are filled up, they either have to demolish some improvements or wait for the city to level up again. And if they want to build some of the game's triumphs, they will need to set aside an entire zone just for it.

 <p>
  Along with that, as a city levels up, it will also occasionally unlock some experts. These experts can be applied to certain buildings, giving them bonuses like faster production or more food. There really is not much more to these experts outside of that, but their existence does help give cities a bit more functionality, which is nice to see.

 <p>
  While all of this does give the cities a bit more life, as crafters are constantly crafting goods and things always need managing, it is also where one of
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  's problems comes into play. It may be a 4X game, but sometimes it can get extremely overwhelmingly fast as there is far too much going on, especially when players have multiple cities. The entire thing is not helped by the fact that the UI is often tedious to navigate, with it not always being clear how to find certain things. And after a while, players may just get burnt out by the sheer number of things they have to juggle.

  Much like
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization
  </em>
  ,
  <em>

  also puts a heavy emphasis on researching new technologies. This research gives players more things to improve their civilization with, and as they progress through the different ages, they will unlock even more exciting technologies.

  As players build things, research technology, and engage in various actions, they will earn Prestige points. These Prestige points are earned throughout

  's three major acts, with each civilization being displayed on a scoreboard. As the acts progress, civilizations are split up into three different tiers depending upon how many points they have. The top three tiers are safe, but if the bottom tier is not careful by the time that act ends, then those nations will be eliminated. That means there is a constant race to ensure players have enough Prestige points or the world may move on without them.

  Once a certain number of civilizations reach a certain technological era,

  will start counting down until the current act ends. So, if players are not close to finishing the current tech tree, they are actually able to skip ahead if they wish. They will lose out on many of the bonuses, yet if that is the only way to survive, then it is something they must do. Luckily, some future technology will also include those bonuses, but some may be lost forever. This makes for an intriguing research system. However, it also can be a bit aggravating, as players must spend more time collecting prestige than actually forging their path through history.

 <p>
  Not only can the UI be cumbersome and the game's many systems a bit overwhelming, but there are a few other aspects that let
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  down. For starters, the game's wars are rather lackluster, with them mostly just being focused on taking or protecting a single city. This means that players are not getting the massive 4X wars they may want, especially as units do not have 3D models unless players specifically choose to watch the battle ensue. Instead, they send a giant icon that displays their unit type with a number to attack another, with the battle quickly ending before it even began.

 <p>
  Along with that, there are hardly any options for diplomacy, the random quests do not feel that rewarding, and it is not always clear what players should be focusing on. While it does offer some strategy thrills, all of this really holds it back from being another genre kingpin. With DLC and future updates, it may have a chance to iron out its weaker aspects. But, outside a few unique twists, it feels like it is missing something to make it truly worth the price of admission.

  Fans of LEGO and
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  will want to know that some of the sets the two companies have collaborated on are being discontinued. Some of the sets are being sold at a discount as a result, and the Nintendo LEGO set discontinuations impact both the US and the UK.

  Over the years, there have been numerous collabs between LEGO and Nintendo properties.
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games have been celebrated with LEGO sets the most, but other Nintendo properties like
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  have also received their own.

 <p>
  Nintendo gamers who enjoy LEGO should consider picking up some sets soon, as several are being discontinued. In the US, Peach's Castle Expansion Set and Garden Balloon Ride Expansion Set, Nabbit at Toad's Shop Expansion Set, Dixie Kong's Jungle Jam Expansion Set, and Diddy Kong's Mine Cart Ride Expansion Set are all being discontinued. Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, and Peach's sets are available with 20% discounts, while Nabbit at Toad's Shop is still going for its normal price. In the UK, the number of sets being discontinued is much more extensive, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Peach's Garden Balloon Ride, Yoshi's Egg-cellent Forest Expansion Set, and more.

  While some fans are undoubtedly upset to see some of these sets being discontinued, it's far from the end of the partnership between Nintendo and LEGO.
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  are both getting new LEGO sets that will begin releasing in 2025.
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  will see six LEGO sets that will all launch on January 1, while
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  will get three. It's not the only collaboration that Nintendo will have a part in, either, as
  <em>
   Lego Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is launching on the Nintendo Switch in November. It's an unusual choice, as all the prior
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  games have been exclusive to PC and PlayStation platforms.

 <p>
  With new LEGO collections coming out all the time, there's a constant process of culling older sets and introducing new ones. Fans who haven't picked up the Nintendo sets about to be discontinued should consider picking them up before it's too late. At that point, the only option will probably be to buy them from resellers, who tend to mark up the prices with the knowledge that there's a limited supply available for sale.

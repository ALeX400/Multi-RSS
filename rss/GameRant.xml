  Those who play
  <strong>
   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
  </strong>
  understand how important it is to gain as many Bells as possible. The in-game currency is necessary for players to purchase the decor, outfits, upgrades, and basically anything and everything that will help enhance the appeal of their character and environments. One of the best ways to earn Bells in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  is by buying and selling turnips and while some didn't enjoy the process, the method allowed players to earn more than they needed when done right. As good as it was, the next mainline entry could take it even further, ushering in a slightly more complex yet enjoyable way of gaining money.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , turnips were a volatile way of earning Bells. Players would try to buy them from Daisy Mae for a low price, then sell them before her next visit, hoping to earn a profit as the item's value often changes. This system within the game is known as the Stalk Market and acts as an imitation of how real-life stocks are bought and sold. If the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  goes the city route, having something similar to a stock market building for vegetables like the turnip could be interesting. This would take
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  ' Stalk Market to a whole new level, setting up a deep and compelling way of earning Bells.

 <p>
  The Turnip Stalk Market in
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  was a good way for people to learn how to manage their Bells, and it gave them a different way to play the game. There was a feeling of excitement and satisfaction in seeing one's Bell count rise after making profitable transactions, and those can be replicated in the next mainline entry with a newer version of the Stalk Market. With that said, there are a few ways the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game could implement it:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Having the game set in a city can help explain why there are structures specifically for the vegetable Stalk Market.
  </li>
  <li>
   Daisy Mae, along with a new business-like look, could return and explain that the success of the turnip market has caused other specific vegetables to see an increased value.
  </li>
  <li>
   Other NPCs with similar roles to Daisy could be introduced to rival her turnip stock, while also teaching players how the new Stalk Market operates and how they can be a part of it.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  If the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  goes the city route, this could be an interesting feature that could take the franchise in a direction it has yet to go. Such a change allows players to live out a fast-paced and ever-changing lifestyle similar to a real-world stockbroker, allowing them to enjoy something other than the usual comfortable and cozy gameplay the series is known for.

  Why a New Stalk Market Would Benefit the Next Animal Crossing Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   New Horizon
  </em>
  's turnips brought out the best and worst in people but increased and improved community activity, a new Stalk Market could do the same, only on a much bigger scale. More vegetables with fluctuating prices mean more reasons for players to create new connections and discuss whose community to visit to make profitable trades. This allows the game to have a level of engagement that surpasses all the other titles. It could even lead to the developers creating a new and improved n-game system that allows for better tracking of prices, friend communication, item management, and more. A new Stalk Market can bring many benefits for the next mainline entry and if Nintendo deems it worth adding, it could mean an all-new evolution to the series' formula.

 <p>
  The next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  shouldn't pass up on the golden opportunity of a bigger and better Stalk Market. If the turnips in
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  could do so much to improve the gameplay experience, a new system involving vegetable purchasing and selling could shake up the franchise in a way that brings it to new heights.

      <title>Madden NFL 25: How To One-Hand Catch</title>

 <p>
  Knowing the right decision to make for each play in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Madden NFL 25
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a key part of the game. From choosing the best play to run against your opponent's defense to figuring out which receivers have the best match-up at any given moment, players will need to know what their best option is across every game mode. This includes choosing what kind of catch a receiver will make on the ball to best set them up afterward,
  <strong>
   such as the One-Hand Catch
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":451} -->

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  In all honesty, this kind of catch isn't the most strategic or beneficial of catches;
  <strong>
   it is purely a highlight reel kind of thing
  </strong>
  . Players can have their receiver go up and snag the ball with just one hand to show just how athletic they are. While it may not have much use for winning a game, it feels so good when pulled off. This is why this guide is here to help anyone looking to get a bunch of catches worth of SportsCenter.

 <p>
  You'll be able to pull off a stylish one-hand catch right away when you start playing the game, since it only requires you to use the left shoulder button of your controller. This means pressing either
  <strong>
   the LB button on Xbox or the L1 button for PS5
  </strong>
  . When the ball is in the air, simply press this button, and the player will attempt to make a catch with their hand.

  Now, of course,
  <strong>
   this is risky
  </strong>
  and poses plenty of chances for the pass to either be incomplete or result in a turnover. With just one hand going for it, there is much
  <strong>
   less ball security
  </strong>
  when catching. Because of this, going for a one-handed catch when the receiver is wide open is the best choice so they can avoid a defender interfering. It's just more realistic to expect them to pull it off in these situations, even though it's not a given.

   The Princess and the Frog
  </em>
  . The arrival of this character may not come as a complete surprise to the most attentive of fans, as Gameloft has been teasing Tiana's
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  debut since early August 2024. The upcoming update will also include her iconic restaurant, Tiana's Palace. The eatery will be tied to a quest geared toward helping Tiana set up shop in the Dreamlight Valley.

  One of the rewards for fostering a friendship with Tiana will be her meal stall, where players will be able to purchase a wide variety of snacks. As is the case with all such major content drops, Dapper Delights will expand
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  's selection of Star Paths. The clothing, makeup, hairstyles, and furniture that can be unlocked as part of the new Star Path have all been inspired by the Roaring Twenties, the time period in which
  <em>

  </em>
  takes place. The Dapper Delights Star Path will even introduce a flashy new outfit for Donald Duck.

  multiplayer sessions with players on other platforms. Wardrobe and furniture menu improvements are also part of the upcoming patch, introducing quality-of-life improvements like a search bar and the ability to hide items or mark them as favorites.

  It's been revealed that the
  <em>
   Evil Within
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  IPs will remain with Microsoft following Krafton's acquisition of former first-party
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  studio Tango Gameworks. Krafton is a South Korean game publisher best known for publishing the battle royale genre's breakout hit
  <em>
   PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
  </em>
  , as well as
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  creator Glen Schofield's latest horror swing,
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  was a great success in the earlier days of the battle royale craze,
  <em>
   The Callisto
  </em>
  <em>
   Protocol
  </em>
  struggled to garner much acclaim when it released in 2022.

 <p>
  Earlier this year, Xbox made the devastating announcement that it had closed four of its Bethesda studios. Of the four closed studios, Tango Gameworks' closure was the biggest source of confusion for Xbox fans, as just last year Xbox's one and only Japanese studio released its rhythm action game
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  to critical acclaim. Many Xbox fans argue that
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  turned out to be Xbox's best game of 2023, so Krafton's unexpected buyout saving Tango Gameworks, the
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  IP, and most of the studio's remaining staff was largely met with praise from the Xbox community.

 <p>
  Now, new details have emerged about the nature of Krafton's acquisition of former Xbox and Bethesda studio Tango Gameworks. MP1st has gained confirmation from Krafton that it only gained control over Tango's
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  IP, and that the studio's survival horror series
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  and its first-person action horror title
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  both remain with Microsoft following the acquisition.

 <p>
  Krafton's timely buyout of Tango Gameworks is certainly great news for fans of its latest title,
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  , as it'll be able to move forward with a potential sequel under Krafton. However, fans of Tango's horror outings
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  are left a bit more uncertain. If Xbox were to move ahead with either IP, it would have to be with a different internal studio. Thankfully, many of Xbox's first-party studios specialize in first-person games, so a potential
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  sequel would likely be in great hands. That said, it seems like
  <em>
   The Evil Within 3
  </em>
  could potentially be more difficult to get off the ground with a different studio at the helm, as none of Xbox's studios are known for survival horror.
 </p>

 <p>
  It will be interesting to see what Tango Gameworks will work on next under Krafton's leadership. A
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  sequel may certainly be in the cards, but the studio's horror roots shouldn't be ignored either. Despite the studio founder and survival horror mastermind Shinji Mikami departing the studio last year, there's surely more than enough horror talent left at the studio to make a new horror game; it just won't be an
  <em>
   Evil Within
  </em>
  title. Whatever the case, it'll likely be several years before Tango fans will be able to know more about the studio's next outing.

 <p>
  On paper, the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  campaign sounds plenty exciting. The story takes place after the events of
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  and the past missions of
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  , and sees the return of fan favorite character Frank Woods. The mission design is said to take its cues from past
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games, so fans should be able to expect plenty of variety in one mission to the next, not to mention the franchise's signature over-the-top set-pieces.

  Of course, the campaign is just one piece of the
  <em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  officially unveiled its first DLC during Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase, with "Shattered Space" looking to take the space exploration game into a horror-themed adventure. The highly-anticipated title from
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  developer Bethesda launched late last year to massive fanfare, built up as the first new original franchise from Bethesda in over twenty years. The game has been a mainstay at gaming award shows following its launch, with
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  receiving a nomination for "Best RPG" at the 2023 Game Awards. Now, the game's first DLC is on the way.

  Bethesda originally announced the first post-launch DLC for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  last year, in the months leading up to the game's release. The developer has dropped a number of teasers for the DLC expansion in the year since its confirmation, hinting at its potential horror themes and teasing a potential release date for the DLC. Fans have also often speculated about the scale of Shattered Space, suggesting that the DLC may end up being a massive expansion for the game. Now, the wait is over as Bethesda has officially lifted the curtain on
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space DLC.

 <p>
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's first major DLC comes as fans have been given plenty of reason to be excited about the new update to the sci-fi game. Shattered Space marks the first time Bethesda has used the term "expansion" for its DLC packages since
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  's "Shivering Isles" update. The
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  update added a massive new area for players to explore, alongside new content for the already sizable RPG. Shattered Space looks to bring a plethora of new content to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , giving players the chance to embark on a new horror-themed adventure.

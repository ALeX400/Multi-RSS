  <strong>
   <em>
    Chained Together
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a friendship-ending co-op game where players are quite literally chained together and must cooperate to escape the depths of hell. The game features a variety of levels, each presenting unique challenges. Players must use their chains to swing, climb, and reach high places to escape the blazing heat.

  Interestingly, the chain that ties you to your friends is far from being a mere cosmetic item. It behaves realistically, responding to the forces of gravity, and can even wrap around platforms. Since its release,
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  has captivated players with its innovative co-op mechanics and realistic physics. Given its popularity, many gamers are eager to know on which platforms they can experience the chaos of
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  .

  At the time of writing,
  <strong>
   Chained Together is only available on PC through the Steam Store.
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, there are no Xbox, PS, or mobile versions of

  While
  <strong>
   Chained Together does support controllers
  </strong>
  and technically runs on Steam Deck, it’s important to note that the experience isn’t fully optimized for handheld play. For instance, some of the game’s more challenging achievements require precise input, which might be difficult to achieve on a handheld device. So, if you want to truly experience the chaos of
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  , a traditional PC setup is your best bet.

  While Anegar Games is currently focused on refining the Steam version of
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  , there has been no official word on console ports. Though the PC version already supports controllers, there’s no news of when the game will make its way to other platforms.

 <p>
  It's certainly possible that
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  could eventually be ported to Xbox and PS consoles, as many PC games have transitioned to other platforms in the past. However, as of now, there's no official confirmation from Anegar Games regarding Xbox and PS releases.

 <p>
  For now, Anegar Games is fully committed to improving
  <em>
   Chained Together
  </em>
  on PC. They have even added a new
  <strong>
   custom maps
  </strong>
  feature, where players can unleash their creativity and create their own maps using an in-game editor. When they’re done, they can share the maps with the community on the Steam Workshop.

  Rogues
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  are excellent at both melee and ranged combat, but to make the most out of this class in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , players need to get armor that synergizes perfectly with their build. And there's a lot of gear to pick from, and that can be confusing. So, it's worth taking a look at the best early-game armor for Rogues.

 <p>
  This topic has some of the best pieces of equipment players can get early during the adventure, and since some of the loot is randomized and drops from certain containers, it can be tricky to pinpoint their location. Luckily, these armor pieces can be bought from vendors and are guaranteed to drop from certain chests.

  Found in one of the first chests in the Rogue playthrough during the intro quest, this Light Armor is associated with the Grey Warden's Faction, and can also be purchased from their vendor at Hossberg Wetlands once "The Siege of Weisshaupt" quest ends. More drops of the same armor improve its quality and perks and can be found as random enemy-chest drops/quest rewards. This armor is ideal for rogues in the early stages of the game since it provides extra Armor and Heavy Attack damage.

 <p>
  Many enemies during the first quests will have lots of Armor and this means players will have to chip it down before they can cause real damage to them. To complicate things even more, Armor prevents Staggering, so as long as this doesn't drop, the Rogue cannot use its best skills and take advantage of buffs received by Takedowns. So, the Recruit's Simple Tunic is a smart choice for every low-level Rogue.

  Jumper's Deft Leathers can be found in Arlathan forest during the "In Entropy’s Grasp" quest, once players find Bellara and activate the first Beacon. A second armor can be purchased from the Veil Jumpers Faction Vendor, which will improve the armor to Uncommon. This is one of the best armors to start a Ranger Rogue build because it provides a lot of Ammo regeneration, crucial for those who want to use the bow.

 <p>
  If combined with Bows that also provide Arrow Regeneration, It will provide a constant supply of arrows no matter how fast players can shoot. The tricky part is finding the right Bow to pair it with, but the Veil's Edge seems to be the best choice since its first perk provides an extra 50% Arrow Regeneration.

  This Medium Armor can be found during the "Shadows of Ancient Arlathan" quest (the first main quest after the intro) in a chest below the bridge near the waterfall by entering the cave and following the path down the river. The second version of this armor can be purchased from Veil Jumpers Faction vendor for 650 Gold.

  This is an excellent choice for Rogues building toward the Saboteur Specialization, which can generate a lot of Primers and opportunities for Detonations. Considerably one of the best choices in the first stages of the game, since it will also increase the window of opportunity to take advantage of Primers whenever allies generate them.

  Players can purchase this Armor from the Armor vendor Stall in Treviso Canals Market and can purchase one more from the Antivan Crows vendor in the Cantori Diamond. They will also find a third one early on while opening one of the chests in the Treviso Terraces. Once they unlock the second Perk of this piece of armor, it becomes a great advantage to have early on the adventure.

  Especially useful for Duelist Rogues, since they specialize in causing damage with combo chains that mix Light and Final attacks in quick succession. The extra Physical damage caused by the Legendary Perk, once unlocked, is as broken as it sounds: clears out an entire battlefield in a matter of seconds.

  Contrary to what the name suggests, this Medium Armor is better suited for Rangers and Saboteurs than Duelists. Its great bonuses to the amount of arrows Rook can carry and to Hipfire Damage are quite useful early on.

  As new perks are unlocked, this Armor becomes incredibly strong, and players can find one of these in the Treviso Canal Market Stalls, then another in the Antivan Crows vendor, and one more easily accessible during the Lucanis Dellamorte recruiting quest titled "Sea of Blood," and the fourth one after completing Lucanis second companion quest.

  Players will be able to purchase this armor in the Treviso Canal Market Stalls, the second is sold in the Antivan Crows Faction vendor, and a third one lies waiting inside a manor found by crossing the Bridge of the Treviso Canals Market. The chest lies behind a wall activated with the Lyrium Knife and players will have to defeat an Elven Automaton to acquire it.

 <p>
  The bonuses offered to the players in return will empower their defense against Antaam enemies and will grant powerful bonuses later on the adventure, especially that boost against High Dragons. So, it's one of the best Armors to acquire early on so players can upgrade it fast.

 <p>
  Ideal for Critical Damage based builds, especially effective for Duelist and Veil Ranger Rogues, this Light Helmet can be acquired in the Shadow Dragon faction shop, and another one can be looted by completing the "Missing Relic Case" (Neve Gallus' First Quest).

 <p>
  Once players unlock the extra Critical Damage bonus, they will notice a fair difference each time they land a critical hit (by striking weak points) and this will ensure their capabilities as Rogues are optimized to the fullest.

 <p>
  Great for Duelists and Saboteur Rogues, this Light Helmet can be purchased in the Antivan Crows Faction vendor, and another one can be found in the Treviso Canals Market. Every final attack on a single combo chain is empowered thanks to this piece of armor, and as players unlock more perks, this damage bonus is greatly increased.

 <p>
  The Epic and Legendary Perks are simply too good to be true, and Rogue players will notice a great difference in total damage output after they unlock these. It's highly recommended that players purchase each upgrade of this Helmet from vendors, so there's more chance that they obtain an improved version early on.

  Forest Guardian's Veil is found in the "Shadows of Ancient Arlathan" quest, the second chest players will find contains the common version of the Helmet, and the Veil Jumper vendor sells the uncommon upgrade. As the story progresses, players will find the Rare version in one of Bellara's quests, the Epic version in the "Slaying the Fangscorcher" Taash quest, and the Legendary version in the "Blood of Arlathan" main quest.

  This Helmet's power increases the more faction strength the players have in their Veil Jumper allies, and it's ideal for the Veil Ranger specialization since it focuses on providing bonuses to Weakspot Damage.

  Players can acquire this Medium Helmet during the "Missing Relic Case Quest." Once they take the "detour" to go down to the Docks, Neve will lead them through the Spare A Coin Boulevard. Right across the street, there will be a Chest inside a gate with a Venatori Corpse and a lore object inside. Players can check to the right and spot a scaffold where they can climb on, and jump to access the chest. Then, by activating the lever they can return to the quest.

  This Helmet improves Detonation damage by 25% and will synergize with most Duelist and Saboteur abilities, as well as with Lucanis, Hardin, and Neve's Primer skills. It is one of the best to have early during the adventure. Plus, it has one of the coolest designs.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age
   </em>
  </strong>
  series focuses on its setting, the continent of Thedas, more than focusing on a single central character. Despite this, it has many iconic characters who have helped solve multiple catastrophes. While the characters of the first game face the apocalyptic Fifth Blight — an invasion of wicked darkspawn from underground —
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  characters prevent an ancient priest from becoming an evil god.

 <p>
  In each adventure, the player's character journeys with a party of different companions, which fit into the categories of warrior, rogue, or mage. While each character is unique and powerful in their own way, some of the mages have bigger impacts on the narrative, more powerful abilities, or more interesting stories.

  <em>
   Leliana's Song
  </em>
  is a standalone DLC that explores the story of how Leliana ended up as a Chantry laysister in Lothering before the Fifth Blight began. Sketch is one of her companions in this story. He was helping Leliana steal back some forged Orlesian documents when their party was betrayed by Marjolaine.

 <p>
  Leliana was imprisoned by her former teacher, but Sketch came to her rescue. Together, they eventually exacted their revenge on the bard. After the adventure, Leliana moved to Lothering while Sketch ended up in Kirkwall. He was targeted by different groups due to his connection with Leliana but was saved each time by Hawke. Years later, he would go on to the Inquisition, assuming the Inquisitor sided with the rebel mages.

  Finn was a Fereldan mage who lived in the Circle Tower on Lake Calenhad. He was an expert in Tevinter history and linguistics and spent most of his time in the library. When the Warden-Commander was at the Tower searching for clues related to Morrigan's disappearance, Finn ended up helping track her down.

 <p>
  Finn was able to speak with a Tevinter spirit to learn how to unlock the secrets of eluvians and use one to find out where Morrigan was. This led to the Warden-Commander's final confrontation with the powerful mage, which was only witnessed by Finn and an elf warrior named Ariane. After this adventure, the Warden-Commander returned to their duties while Finn traveled with Ariane rather than return to life in the Circle Tower.

  Wynne was a powerful mage who was raised as a Circle Mage after her magic abilities manifested as a child. She has been loyal to the Chantry for her whole life and was so well respected by her fellow mages that she was asked to become the First Enchanter of Ferelden's tower, which she refused out of a desire to stay out of Circle politics.

  She survived the harrowing Battle of Ostagar and later joined the Warden-Commander to help end the Blight. She was a great asset to the party with her great prowess as a Spirit Healer. After the Blight, Divine Justinia ordered her to investigate a friend of hers who had become an abomination. In the process, a templar knight-commander was killed. Wynne sacrificed her life to revive the templar, who would go on to help the Inquisition with Cole. Wynne lived a long life and did good for a great many people.

  Velanna was a Dalish elf who served as First to her Keeper. When her sister disappeared, she began attacking traveling humans on the road through the Wending Wood, blaming them for her sister's death. The Warden-Commander has the option to slay her or ask her to join the Grey Wardens and hunt down the real culprits.

  If she survives this encounter, she also survives her Joining and becomes a Grey Warden. She can help the Warden-Commander track down the unusual darkspawn in the area, led by The Architect, and defeat them. Unfortunately, there is no way to reunite Velanna with her sister but there are many ways that Velanna's story can end — she can fall in the final battle of the DLC, disappear during the battle's aftermath, remain with the Wardens until she eventually departs for the Deep Roads, or live in the wilds and protect human villages.

 <p>
  The Champion of Kirkwall, the player character in
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  , had two younger twin siblings named Bethany and Carver. If the player chooses to be a mage, Bethany is killed by an ogre during the opening battles of the game. Otherwise, Carver dies and Bethany plays one of several different potential roles in the story. If she joins her sibling on a journey to the Deep Roads during Act One, she becomes infected with the taint and dies unless Anders makes her a Grey Warden. After that, she is rarely seen in the story because of her new role, except that she does show up to fight at the player's side during the climactic battle of the game.

  If she does not travel to the Deep Roads, Bethany is instead arrested for being an apostate and is taken to live in the Circle. Throughout the story, she is not seen often but reports that she has ascended in the Circle's ranks to where she now teaches young apprentices. She is seen at times throughout the game, but in the final battle will only stand with the player if they support the mages over the templars.

  Merrill was a Dalish elf who briefly accompanied the Warden-Commander during
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  before fleeing Ferelden with her clan. She went on to be a permanent fixture of Hawke's party in
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  . During her years in Kirkwall, Merrill sought to reconstruct an Eluvian, a magical mirror made by the mysterious ancient elves. She dedicated her life to this, even resorting to blood magic, because she believed she could help restore her people to their former glory and save them from the Alienages that city elves were trapped in.

 <p>
  Her efforts with the Eluvian were ultimately unsuccessful, and she was drawn into the events that started the mage rebellion. She urges Hawke to defend the mages and ends up dying with them if the player sides with the Templars and does not convince her to switch as well. Her role in the story may not be done, since her goals largely align with Solas' plans.

  Vivienne is a mage who sided against the mage rebellion that broke out between
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . She believed that the rebels were selfish and short-sighted, focusing only on the downsides of the Circle of Magi system instead of looking at the benefits that come to mages that live within them.

 <p>
  She decided that the Inquisition was the only force willing and able to withstand the turmoil in the world at the time, and joined as a party member who traveled with the Inquisitor. During these adventures, it is possible that Vivienne can become elected as the next Divine. She can also become the Grand Enchanter of the Circle of Magi or found the College of Enchanters, which is a secular group for mages. In any case, Vivienne ends up as one of the most influential figures in the world in the wake of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  .

  Bellara was one of the first companions to join Rook after Solas' ritual in Minrathous was thwarted at the start of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
  </em>
  She was a mage who had joined up with a new faction called Veil Jumpers. Together, this group explored elven ruins in search of answers about the ancient elven empire.

 <p>
  Bellara had a knack for fixing elven technology and was able to repair the Lighthouse Eluvian, allowing Rook's party to travel instantly to any eluvian spread across Thedas. She spent much time repairing the archive spirit known as the Nadas Dirthalen so she could unravel the secret past of her ancestors. Without her work, Rook would not have much hope in the fight against Solas and the corrupt elven gods.

  Neve Gallus grew up in Dock Town, a large neighborhood of Tevinter's capital city of Minrathous. She was an informant who worked with the Shadow Dragons and other groups who strived against corrupt magisters, slavers, and blood mages. Neve had a working relationship with many different people around Dock Town and had a history with many nefarious villains and criminals from the city's underbelly.

 <p>
  Because of this experience, Varric sought her out to help find Solas and stop him from destroying the Veil between the physical realm and the Fade. He and Rook found her just minutes after the ritual started, making her the very first companion that Rook recruited into their party. Neve's information and magical talents were invaluable parts of the campaign against Ghilan'nain and Elgar'nan, especially when it came to defeating Venatori mages like Aelia.

  Emmrich Volkarin was orphaned at a young age and brought into the Grand Necropolis of Nevarra. He eventually became a sworn member of the Mourn Watch, a faction that tends to the buried dead to maintain their knowledge and keep nefarious undead in check. Emmrich also had a unique ability called "corpse whispering" which allowed him to speak to the deceased.

 <p>
  When the Veilguard needed an expert on the Fade, Bellara reached out to Emmrich for help. The older death mage agreed and joined the team working to stop Solas. Later, he would also unravel the mystery of an old friend-turned-enemy of his — a necromancer named Johanna Hezenkoss. Emmrich was a pillar of the team thanks to his work with spirits, the Fade, and even just his cheerful manner.

  Dorian was a mage from a prestigious family in Tevinter. After a troubled youth, he was mentored by a powerful mage named Gereon Alexius. After Felix Alexius was tainted by darkspawn, Dorian spent two years working to cure the son of his mentor but then left their estate after a heated disagreement. He traveled through Tevinter but was generally ostracized by its people, so he went south.

 <p>
  If the player recruits mages to the Inquisition, Dorian helps the Inquisitor infiltrate Castle Redcliffe and stop his former mentor (despite the powerful time magic that Alexius wielded). Dorian then joined the Inquisition and traveled with the Inquisitor. Two years after Corypheus' defeat, Dorian was selected as Tevinter's ambassador to the Inquisition and helped uncover the Qunari plot to invade the South as well as Solas' true identity and motives. Dorian's wit, charm, and magical prowess made him one of the most memorable companions in the series.

  Anders was a Fereldan mage who joined the Grey Wardens after the Fifth Blight ended when awakened darkspawn were still terrorizing parts of Ferelden. Another companion for this adventure was the Spirit of Justice, who possessed the body of a dead Grey Warden named Kristoff.

  After a time, Anders agreed to let Justice inhabit his body, which caused him to be seen as an abomination. He fled to Kirkwall, where he met Hawke. Over time, Anders' anger toward the injustice done to mages by the Chantry corrupted Justice into a spirit of Vengeance. Together, they hatched a plan to destroy the Kirkwall Chantry and start a war to liberate mages from the Circles. These actions led to the climax of
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  and set up the beginning of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition.
  </em>
  Anders' actions impacted the lives of people all across Thedas, and few ever had as much of an effect on so many people as he did.

  Solas is an elf mage with a mysterious past, which is not revealed until the
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  DLC. All that the player knows before this is that Solas is an elven mage who has special abilities related to dream walking. This led him to know many secrets, including the location of the abandoned fortress of Skyhold. His knowledge and skill as a mage were integral to the Inquisition's success.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  it is revealed that Solas is actually an ancient elf from millennia before the events of the games who led a rebellion against the old elven gods. In a way, he was successful, but it cost his people everything. In a massive reveal about the lore of the world, Solas tells the player that he created the Veil between the physical realm and the Fade, and that he is the reason that the ancient elven empire disappeared. For his deeds, he was remembered as the elven trickster god, Fen'Harel the Dread Wolf. Sadly, he will be opposed to the player in
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  because he seeks to restore what he destroyed at the cost of the world as it currently is.

  Morrigan was raised in the wilderness by her legendary mother, Flemeth. After all but the last two Grey Wardens were killed during a Blight, she joined the survivors — Alistair and the Warden-Commander — and helped them gather enough allies to save Ferelden. During this time, she discovered that her mother was planning to perform a ritual to take over Morrigan's body, so she killed her mother to save herself.

  A year later, the Warden-Commander tracked Morrigan down, only for her to escape through a magical elven portal. She eventually showed up in Orlais and became an advisor to the empress. She also helped the Inquisition during its war against Corypheus. With her magical prowess, involvement in so many events, and ominous warnings of events as yet unseen, Morrigan is truly the most legendary mage of the series.

  As

   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds

  </strong>
  approaches release, the extent of scope has positioned it as an apparent true sequel to the scale of
  <em>
   World

  before it. Although it may have primarily stood out through its elevation of the series' environments and general mechanics, the latest upcoming title is combining a focus on innovative monsters with a similar direction in scale. With a comparable emphasis on sprawling maps and a fresh roster of monsters with unique gimmicks, the selection of creatures in

  In following
  <em>
   World
  </em>
  's promotional strategy,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  held a beta that highlighted how similar the generational debut titles are. However, with the standout Rey Dau, a lightning-themed Flying Wyvern, (which initially showed flagship potential) making an appearance in the beta, it's become clear that the upcoming game is ramping up its ambitious bestiary through dramatic encounters in the early game.

  's Anjanath and Great Jagras, Rey Dau's role in

  An Early Game Thunderblight Flying Wyvern Signals a Dramatic Progression in Wilds' Hunts
 </h3>
 <p>
  Unlike its relatively conventional counterparts from the beta of World, Rey Dau represents a striking shift in the design of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's overall pacing. Despite the spectacle of its connection to the environment, the placement of Rey Dau in promotional material suggests that it won't be close to the game's pinnacle of challenge. This sort of encounter could easily have been relegated to the late or even end game of the series' earliest titles, but being present as early as a beta can only mean that
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  is set to deliver a monster roster that defies traditional expectations of complexity.

  Rey Dau's Lack of Exclusivity is in Line with Rumors of a New Monster Classification
 </h3>
 <p>
  A recent set of major
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  leaks claim that the game will likely feature a story centered around an entirely new type of monster, with the flagship Arkveld falling under that category. Assuming this type becomes the focus of the late game and the scale is accordingly increased to new heights, it would make sense that a Flying Wyvern like Rey Dau has been downgraded to the status of earlier hunt. More straightforward Brute and Fanged Wyverns acted as the introduction to World prior to its full release, but what's been featured in
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  ' own beta may mean that power scaling has permanently gone up for the franchise.

  The 10th epilogue chapter of the two-hour video goes over the making of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  's episodic sequels. While this segment is largely focused on
  <em>
   Episodes 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  , it also spends some time on
  <em>
   Episode 3
  </em>
  , to the point that it even shows some gameplay footage from the long-canceled sequel. This is the most forthcoming Valve has ever been about the ill-fated game, which was effectively abandoned by the early 2010s but took years before it was officially confirmed as canceled.

  Valve Reveals Some of Its Scrapped Half-Life 2: Episode 3 Plans
 </h2>
 <p>
  The documentary also reveals some of the plans that Valve's developers had in store for the shelved game. For instance, it confirms the long-standing rumor that Half-Life 2: Episode 3 was intended to take place in an arctic environment—a theory many fans have speculated about for years, based on some previously leaked concept art. Keeping in line with that theme, Valve initially wanted to have the game feature an ice gun, allowing players to freeze enemies and create blocks of ice. These chunks could be used for various purposes, like creating pathways or raising makeshift defense barriers. The weapon was hence essentially envisioned as
  <em>
   Episode 3
  </em>
  's counterpart to the iconic Gravity Gun that much of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  was designed around.

  Half-Life 2: Episode 3 Was Canceled Because Gabe Newell Was 'Stumped'
 </h3>
 <p>
  Reflecting on
  <em>
   Half-Life 2: Episode 3
  </em>
  's cancellation during the documentary, Valve co-founder and President Gabe Newell characterized the decision as his own "personal failure," admitting he was "stumped" about how
  <em>
   Episode 3
  </em>
  could break new ground, which is something that was always important to him when it comes to pursuing new games. Unable to answer that question, the team eventually moved on to other projects, like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  . "I couldn't figure out why doing
  <em>
   Episode 3
  </em>
  was pushing anything forward," Newell recalled.

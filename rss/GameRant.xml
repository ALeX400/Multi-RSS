  After making its return with a big name change and new engine,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  has had quite the mass revival. As players flock back to appreciate the uniqueness of this extraction shooter once again, Crytek continues to prove that this gem is one that stands out from the masses of other similar titles right now. With an addictive game loop and plenty of variation between matches, there's a lot for players to get stuck into.

 <p>
  With the recent The Harvest Of Ghosts update to the game,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  now adds an exciting limited mode Bounty Clash into the mix too. Finally delivering some way for players to jump quickly into PVP action, this popular new addition has seen a quick rise to success. Fighting a handful of teams in close combat for one bounty token,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  has never been this dangerous, fast-paced, and fun ever before.

 <p>
  A core detail about
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896'
  </em>
  s gameplay falls in its loop of fighting bosses and claiming bounties to extract with. But Bounty Clash as a mode switches this up, giving teams just one bounty token rather than two for their banishment of the boss target. While this may not seem the biggest change, such a small detail can completely change how players go about their fights.

 <p>
  As the most competent player should now be tasked with gathering the bounty, the rest of the team is left in the dark awaiting their call-outs. Reliant on those 5 seconds alone, and a teammate that knows where to look for teams around them, this mode really encourages a lot more strategy than ever before.

 <p>
  Unlike the main survival extraction mode for
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  , Bounty Clash sees players reduced to where they can go. Instead of being able to access the entire map searching for clues to locate one boss, players now have a new way to play. With just one named location on the map available to them, players are forced into the action and unable to leave.

 <p>
  With a warning offered if players attempt to leave this small circle, Bounty Clash pushes everyone to get busy battling for that much-wanted bounty. Trapped in this limited area, each team needs to fight between them to be the last ones that make it out alive. Or perhaps just make it to the extraction points with the bounty token, whichever comes first.

 <p>
  Like the main game mode for
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  , Bounty Clash incorporates the ability for players to pledge for some very useful aids in battle. These are located often centrally on the map, inside buildings, and are more of a challenge to reach. With enhancements like healing and a restoration of health chunks for both the claiming player and their teammates, the one pledge token it costs is often more than worth claiming.

 <p>
  While many may already strategically use the boss banishment for restoration, this extra opportunity is one that can be taken advantage of more than once. Completely changing the game for teams that were perhaps close to burning out, these can put people right back into the action and eager to fight.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896'
  </em>
  s normal mode, Bounty Clash does things a little differently. With four teams spawning across the small area of one named location, it’s likely players will instantly hear footsteps or see movement nearby. With little time to prepare, this is a mode that needs constant concentration and focus. Even hunter choices should be considered for ultimate stealth, as standing out is a quick way to get players killed off early on.

  Whether players are at Mammon’s Gulch and seeing others running along the tracks or behind the rocky terrain, or perhaps the buildings and fields that other locations offer, there’s a variety of ways to play to best find advantage in every position. Strategic weapon loadouts are necessary for the combat too, considering what players will need for these more intimate fights and prioritizing best. Even perks should be carefully considered, increasing players' chances of winning against the others close by.

  While
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896'
  </em>
  s normal enemies are still scattered across the open locations, Bounty Clash completely removes the sometimes lengthy boss battles. Instead, players will only need to interact with the already beaten boss's body on the floor, waiting to banish it and then picking up the bounty token whenever they're ready. Without this need for any kind of fight, players won't waste any ammo or health in anything other than straight-up PVP.

 <p>
  Getting into fights with players seems to be Bounty Clash's main priority, pushing people into combat early on. Whether players still decide to seek the banishment is up to them, with plenty of time to tackle fights and still return to claim the bounty token later down the line. Just make sure that the prized token doesn't end up extracted by someone sneaky through it all.

      Mega Knight is a powerful tank unit ideal for handling spam and countering other tanks like Pekka with added Evolution.

 <p>
  Unlike most competitive games where the initial resources are available equally for all players and the real rivalry is over better ranks,
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  does come with an infamous grind system to upgrade cards to higher levels, directly impacting the cards' effectiveness on the battlefield.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":290} -->
 <p>
  The highest level a card can ever reach is Level 15 or Elite, which delivers the final stat boost to the card, but it takes a lot of effort to upgrade each card to Level 15, and that's why players need to be picky with what cards they really want to upgrade to Elite, as the resources for doing so are extremely scarce unless someone pays a significant amount of real-life money.

 <p>
  Mega Knight used to be a neutral card in the top-tier ranks for a long time, but the arrival of its Evolution made him a meta again after a long time. That being said, Mega Knight has always been a meta in the mid-ladder arenas where players get to unlock Legendary cards gradually.

 <p>
  What makes Mega Knight special is his ability to deal with spam units, which most tanky cards lack. The new Evolution also makes him stronger against other tanks like Pekka, allowing him to knock them back and open up the way toward the crown tower while dealing with counters.

  Ram Rider was an underwhelming pick for a long time, but thanks to the buff she received a few seasons earlier, now she can initiate her rushing move quicker which gives her a winning edge over Hog Rider, though Ram Rider costs one extra Elixir.

 <p>
  While still vulnerable against loads of spam, like Skeleton Army, Ram Rider can slow down any unit around her, which makes countering Ram's rush more difficult with cards that spawn a single or a few instances of a unit. The good news is Ram Rider can target aerial units too, which is yet another plus over Hog Rider.

  With the current meta in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  , where almost every deck contains a Firecracker, equipping Arrows is a must to counter it. Firecracker is one of the strongest cards in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  and nothing can wipe her from the battlefield as effectively as Arrows without wasting much Elixir.

 <p>
  Other than that, Arrows is also perfect for countering any kind of spam unit, from Goblin Barrel to Minion Horde. The amount of damage this spell deals to the crown tower is a little over 100, but in crucial moments, that amount can also count towards claiming the victory.

  Barbarian Barrel is another unit to counter spam, but only works against ground troops. Barbarian Barrel doesn't have the range and effectiveness of The Log, but after it's deployed, a Barbarian warrior comes out of the barrel that could help a lot to distract the enemy's troops or even significantly damage them, so that the crown tower can finish them off with a single shot.

  Barbarian Barrel is one of the best counters against cards like Musketeer, Wizard, Electro Wizard, and even Firecracker. He is also a more economical option to get rid of Goblin Barrel or other 3-Elixir spam units without spending much.

  From the day Phoenix was introduced to
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  , it changed the meta for aerial units significantly. Even after multiple waves of nerfs applied to Phoenix, it is still the best aerial damage dealer, as it can leave effective knockback damage after death, which increases its value regarding its price.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Phoenix is perfect for dealing with units that cannot target aerial threats. It's not ideal for taking down tanky units like Mega Knight, but it can play as a great support card during the attacks, especially knowing that if the opponent is overwhelmed by multiple targets, Phoenix will have enough time to revive after death.

 <p>
  There used to be a close rivalry between Cannon and Tesla Tower as the best defensive structures in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  , but with the release of an Evolution for Tesla Tower, it's now the king of all structures in the game, as it has some unmatched abilities to deny attacks.

 <p>
  The evolved version of Tesla Tower comes with a shock wave that stuns hit enemies briefly and kills low-HP spam units like Skeletons or Bats instantly. The tower's ability to hide itself when no threat is available gives it a sheer edge over any other structure, as Tesla Tower can keep itself safe against spells.

 <p>
  As one of the original
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  cards, Knight has been fairly balanced for a long time now. While his Evolution did bring a bit of overpowered stats, they all were mitigated over time. What makes Knight a perfect card is his strong survivability against the price paid for him.

 <p>
  Aside from Elixir Golem, there is no other 3-Elixir card in the game that can live as long as Knight while also dealing a significant amount of damage. Knight is strong enough to deplete a big chunk of Mega Knight's HP, and if he gets some help from Cannoneer, he will successfully survive the battle against Mega Knight.

  A Winning Condition in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  is referred to as a card that can deal direct damage to the crown tower in a short amount of time, and Miner is the best example of that. Similar to Knight, Miner also has a long survivability while being a low-cost card.

 <p>
  The damage that Miner deals to a crown tower might not be significant, but his impressive survivability makes him the best unit in the game to distract a crown tower. There are lot of great combos that can be executed using Miner, which makes it a versatile card in the game.

  It happens a lot in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  that the player is faced with an all-out attack as multiple units rush toward their crown towers. Denying a situation like this with a unit that can only deal damage to one target at a time seems impossible, but a card like Valkyrie can deal with them all while saving a lot of Elixir for the defender.

  Valkyrie specializes in crowd control and denying spam units. She has become even stronger since the release of her Evolution, as it helps Valkyrie to deal damage to aerial units while also sucking enemies around her toward her axe swings.

  Firecracker has been the meta in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  for quite some time, and the announcement of her Evolution just fortified that position even more. She currently possesses the most powerful Evolution in the game, as she can alone deal with the biggest tanky units in the game if enough time is given.

 <p>
  Both in defense and attack, Firecracker can be a real threat. Her projectile's range is long enough to hit crown towers even when shot from behind the bridge. She is a Winning Condition and a support unit at the same time, and nothing can counter her as perfectly as Arrows.

  To find the Portal Easter egg in

 <ol>
  <li>
   Start the quest “Turn and Face the Strange” during the Blood and Wine DLC. You can find the quest as you make your way through Beauclair. Eventually, you will come across a messenger with a message in hand, which will start the quest.
  </li>
  <li>
   After you start the quest, you will have to make your way through several portals. Make your way to the room with two floors of portals.
  </li>
  <li>
   Head down the portal on the lower floor, where you will find a statue.
  </li>
  <li>
   Walk past the statue and make your way to the rocks leading to a secondary level on the other side.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go through the middle portal you find, and then move to the second portal on your left.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will come to a small opening that you can navigate through. Here, you will need to go through the portal to your back.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will end up in a room with a box right in the center. The crate will have hearts, paying homage to the Companion Cube from the
   <em>
    Portal
   </em>
   games.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next to the box, you will find a chest. Interact with the chest and take the Cake, which looks exactly like the one from
   <em>
    Portal
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, when you look at the portal you came through, you will also notice the color has changed from blue to yellow, just like
   <em>
    Portal
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ol>

  The survival game
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is a unique open-world game built on the premise of surviving alone or with friends in a backyard. The game has players shrunk to minuscule proportions, having them fight for their lives against beasts lurking in the garden. A core part of
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is its base-building mechanics that rely on finding craftable material in the yard that can be used to construct objects such as stairs, walls, and other structures.

  <em>
   Ark: Survival Evolved
  </em>
  is an open-world survival game that forces players to endure a dinosaur-plagued world employing the usual survival tropes, such as crafting, hunting mechanics, and harvesting. In
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  , players can tame dinosaurs, play with friends, and even fight other players who look to survive
  <em>
   Ark's

  In the popular space epic
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , players can build bases known as outposts. Players can construct outposts using the game's construction system across various planets and locations to perform multiple functions and tasks. Examples include resource farms, with outposts acting as a funnel to farm valuable resources, defense for protecting against wildlife, or just simply a place to place your crew members while you explore the stars.

  Outposts have in-depth mechanics, such as requiring power generation from solar and wind sources, which differ depending on the planet. Players must strategically place their base based on its optimum function, what power it needs, and how it operates.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  also allows the creation of multiple outposts, establishing links between each to create value chains.

  When you think of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , crafting survival and, of course, base building come to mind.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  defined the open-world survival genre of video games and set the tone for what base building could be in gaming. When first released over a decade ago,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  introduced players to base building in an open-world setting. Whether that be a tiny mud hut to evade bothersome Creepers or a massive castle with intricate mines and farming systems,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  captured the hearts of gamers with its in-depth base-building mechanics, extensive crafting and customization options, and blocky appeal.

  Ubisoft has said that the long-awaited
  <em>
   <strong>
    Beyond Good and Evil 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still in development, saying that it recently passed an internal milestone with positive feedback.
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  is a bit infamous for being in development hell. It was first teased at E3 2008 with a brief reveal trailer, but it wouldn't get a follow-up until it made a surprise appearance at E3 2017 and E3 2018. The game seemingly went dark again after that, as
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  still hasn't seen the light of day, over 15 years since it was first revealed.

  Ubisoft's ambitious open-world prequel has had a lot of struggles during development, such as high-profile Ubisoft developers like Michel Ancel leaving the company and
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  's late creative director, Emile Morel, tragically passing in 2023. While the game has had a long and troubled development period, Ubisoft Montpellier is still soldiering on with the project.
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2

  is confirmed to still be in development, and it recently made some good progress according to Ubisoft.

  A new report from Kotaku provided some insight into
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  's development, noting how the game had recently passed an important milestone. According to two sources close to the production, the game had successfully received positive feedback from Ubisoft's higher ups. It notes that while
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  is still a ways off, some of the developers working on the game believe that the project has finally "found its footing" and that there is a clear direction for it, after years of tech issues and internal power struggles that resulted in mass burnout at the studio.

  Fawzi Mesmar, who was already involved in overseeing
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  as Ubisoft's VP of Global Creative, has stepped in as the game's creative director post Emile Morel's passing. Ubisoft said that Mesmar will be focusing on continuing to build upon where Morel left off and bringing his vision to life. A number of former staff from the recently disbanded
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
  </em>
  team have also reportedly been moved over to work on
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  as well.

  A lot of this should be good news for fans of
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil
  </em>
  . The cult classic has been making a big comeback recently, as seen with the release of
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  earlier this June. The 20th anniversary remaster even has a mission that teases the long-awaited
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil
  </em>
  sequel. While
  <em>
   <strong>
    Beyond Good and Evil 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still years away, this update is a very encouraging sign for fans.

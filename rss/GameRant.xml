  <strong>
   Sega
  </strong>
  COO and recently appointed president Shuji Utsumi has said that the publisher is considering a Netflix-esque gaming subscription service for its games. The gaming industry has been transitioning to a more streaming-esque service, and Sega appears to be considering the same thing. Many gaming companies have also transitioned to providing games via a subscription service, as seen with Microsoft and Sony's own services.
 </p>
 <p>
  Microsoft has the Xbox Game Pass, while Sony offers PlayStation Plus. Subscribers have to pay a monthly or annual fee for access to a range of titles instead of just owning them outright. Other companies like Nintendo, EA, and Ubisoft have all offered their own subscription plans too, with Nintendo Switch Online in particular giving fans access to several classic games from Nintendo's library, including the Sega Genesis platform at a higher tier. Based on recent comments made by Sega's president, the publisher is heavily considering the possibility of opening its own subscription service.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a statement provided to BBC.com, Shuji Utsumi said that subscription productions like Netflix were interesting and that Sega is evaluating some opportunities that this would provide. This move to a Sega-based streaming gaming service is still very early, so it's likely this idea is only in the planning stages. "We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now," said Utsumi.

  Sega recently delisted several classic games across various platforms, including PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. Some of these delisted games include the
  <em>
   Sega Genesis Classics
  </em>
  collection,
  <em>
   Sonic the Fighters
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 2
  </em>
  , and many more. It's possible that Sega is delisting all of these games across various services so it can consolidate its library under a single service. As such, it's not implausible that Sega wants to put its games under one service and make a more direct profit from it.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it could be a beneficial service for those who are big fans of Sega, there are already a lot of different subscription services available that gamers will have to pay for in order to keep up with the library. Various insiders who spoke with BBC.com voiced similar concerns, saying Sega considering its own rival subscription service will lead to its games being removed from other services.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shuji Utsumi also spoke to BBC.com about his own confidence in reviving
  <strong>
   Sega
  </strong>
  with not only the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  franchise, but several other legacy IPs, as seen with upcoming reboots of properties like
  <em>
   Crazy Taxi
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Jet Set Radio
  </em>
  . As such, it seems like the publisher is transitioning to a more modern global strategy, such as opening its own gaming subscription service.

 <p>
  Gacha games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  are well known for costing their most dedicated players hundreds or thousands of dollars in in-game purchases. The payment model for these games can be a financial drain at best and a totally destructive force at worst. However, there is plenty of free fun to be had in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  . It is totally possible to get entire outfits from banners without entering any credit card information. It takes a little more patience, time, and planning, but exploring Miraland as a free-to-play stylist is still very rewarding.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing is to prioritize exploration; there really isn't a way to grind diamonds that is more effective than just progressing the main story and discovering new regions. Even so, being smart with the free currency players receive, completing certain tasks, and collecting a high-quality wardrobe can all help stack those diamonds.

  There are rewards in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  for logging on multiple days in a row and completing daily tasks. Doing these dailies is a requirement for leveling up (which grants even more rewards) and provides the best early-game access to diamonds and bling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, logging on daily boosts Miralevel and can also be a part of ongoing events. Later on, there are also certain rare animals that only drop one material per day, so it is important to rack up as many of those as possible. This will be a familiar rhythm for gamers familiar with gacha games and MMORPGs; instead of playing for hours at once (though of course, that happens, too), players log on for short periods very often.

  Diamonds are an in-game free currency that can be exchanged for many things in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki,
  </em>
  but the most important resources that can be purchased with Diamonds are Revelation Crystals and Resonite Crystals. These can be used to resonate with different banners to get rare outfits. The two crystals are very similar, but
  <strong>
   most diamonds should go towards Revelation Crystals for players who do not want to spend real money
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  These crystals go towards temporary banners that are not always available, as opposed to Resonite crystals, which are used on the permanent banner. The time limit on these banners means that players should prioritize them over the permanent ones. Plus, Resonite can occasionally be acquired for free by increasing Miralevel or accomplishing other in-game tasks.

 <p>
  Depending on how much time players have to grind in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , it will be important to spend resources wisely. Since temporary banners have a time limit, players are much more likely to get complete outfits if they focus on resonating with one banner at a time, as opposed to splitting their Revelation Crystals between two sets of outfits. Often, two five-star banners run at the same time. This is called a
  <strong>
   hell event
  </strong>
  by some fans of the franchise because it is so difficult to complete both banners.
 </p>
 <p>
  This might mean missing out on one banner every event, but these banners do come back eventually (though, based on previous
  <em>
   Nikki
  </em>
  titles, this may take a while). Playing for free means being patient and planning for what is most important. So, players should pick a favorite outfit and aim for that first.

  Hidden at the bottom row of icons on the PearPal, the message icon is where players will find information or items sent over by Infold. These messages sometimes include crystals, threads, bubbles, or links to surveys that pay out large amounts of diamonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  These can be easy to miss under the mountains of menus in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  but they contain some of the largest amounts of the most useful materials to get players started.
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  players should keep an eye out between server updates and after any large-scale bugs, as Infold may send some apology diamonds.

  There are a lot of menus to keep track of in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki,
  </em>
  but it is worth it to check them daily.The Courses menu has a massive list of tasks that are rewarded with small amounts of diamonds, plus each stylist level comes with major rewards. However, players must manually accept all of these, or they will just sit there, remaining unusable in the menu interface. The same goes for the Miralevel menu and basically any PearPal app--
  <strong>
   rewards build up and must be selected manually to be usable
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should also try to accomplish the daily wishes every day. This is required for leveling up, and it is one of the easiest ways to build up resources and currency for free.

  There are lots of compilations of all the codes currently active in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki,
  </em>
  but players can be the first to know about these offers by joining the
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  discord. These codes can be input via the settings. To do so, players should go to the gear icon on the PearPal (in the same row as the message icon), navigate to "Other," and select input codes.
 </p>
 <p>
  These codes provide some of the best rewards in the game and will likely continue to be released by Infold. Checking for new codes every so often can be an easy way to get diamonds, bling, and even whole outfits for free.

  Diamonds are the most useful currency that
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  players can access for free. They can be exchanged for crystals, which give players access to the rarest outfits, among other things. They give free-to-play players the most access possible to outfits that can also be exchanged for premium currency. These can be found in a variety of ways, such as activating Spires, completing mini-games perfectly, doing side quests, and finding chests.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  players will find plenty of diamonds by completing the main story. In general, being a thorough explorer and not skipping any optional content will result in the best diamond acquisition, there are ways to grind them.

  players should be sure to keep that wardrobe upgraded via the Glow-Up app on the PearPal in order to perform as well as possible in styling contests. Completing these perfectly rewards diamonds, and there are plenty of outfit sketches that can only be acquired via beating an NPC in a styling contest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can track stylists and see rewards for defeating them via the "factions" app on the PearPal. This is also important, as materials needed to craft the Miracle Outfits can only be acquired by defeating stylists and Sovereigns.

 <p>
  Alignment charts originated in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, with characters mapped according to two axes: the moral and ethical. The result was nine alignments, stretching between lawful, neutral, and chaotic on one side and evil, neutral, and good on the other. This style of character analysis has evolved further, with fans of many different games, films, and shows (to name a few mediums) categorizing characters according to this iconic 3x3 grid.
 </p>
 <p>
  This list takes a look at some great RPGs for playing as characters who fall into the category of chaotic good. The term usually denotes characters who are generally positive and well-meaning, but who sometimes do unconventional or frowned upon things to achieve their goals, carving their own path rather than adhering to some of society's norms and conventions. This especially manifests in an opposition to order and authority, as those systems can often feel too restrictive — or foster corruption. Naturally, some of these games draw from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, where alignment is still commonly used to divide characters by their traits. Others aren’t inspired by the popular game, but retain the same ability to embody enthralling characters with fascinating skills and traits.

  Quite a departure from other games on this list,
  <em>
   Outer Worlds
  </em>
  offers a satirical look at space colonization, with players taking on the role of the Captain, a messy but ultimately well-meaning protagonist who tries his best to represent what is right against a backdrop of corporate greed on an intergalactic scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gameplay includes navigating alien colonies, challenging the exploitation of corporations, interacting with other characters, and some tactical combat. Players can edit weapons to suit their play style, and decisions made in conversations have a huge impact on the story, meaning players can really embrace being a ‘chaotic good’ character as much as they want.

  is a game that clearly takes some inspiration from Dungeons and Dragons, with a similar gameplay strategy and excellent multiplayer options. Players are 'Sourcerers,' a group fighting to reclaim their magical powers (manipulating energy to cast spells) in a world where they are persecuted.
 </p>
 <p>
  While lots of players debate over whether any of the Origin characters in
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  truly fit into the chaotic good archetype, the closest is arguably Beast. A companion character, Beast is a caring and loving person who tends to make poor decisions, failing to think before doing. Players can also design their own characters, defining their morality through in-game choices.

  takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of the Mojave Desert, known as the Mojave Wasteland, with player decisions shaping the way the world develops as they move through the story. Most fans of the game would agree that the protagonist, a courier who awakens with a mysterious injury, is a chaotic good character.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are other ways for players to play
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas

  from a chaotic good perspective. The Kings, one of the minor factions that can be found in the Mojave Wasteland, generally operate in a chaotic good direction, with one of their key tenets being a basic respect for every character. Players can join the Kings as an honorary member.

  The
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy tells the tale of an intergalactic conflict between humans and an advanced machine race, the Reapers, with players taking on the role of Commander Shepard. Shepard must navigate difficult decisions that could affect the future of the human race. The choices players make are what make the
  <em>
   Mass Effect Trilogy
  </em>
  feel authentic and meaningful, meaning players can certainly embody an archetypal 'chaotic good' role if they choose.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot of players find that Commander Shepard exemplifies the ideals of the chaotic good archetype: he always seeks to protect the innocent and inspire other characters in the battle against the Reapers, even if that means bending the rules to do what he thinks is right, and sometimes defying authority for the sake of the greater good. Of course, Commander Shepard doesn't have to be played as a 'chaotic good' character, but players can lean into playing as 'Paragon Shepard' for a sense of goodness, with the room to add some unorthodox choices throughout the story via Renegade choices.

 <p>
  Choices really matter in
  <em>

  , so there's plenty of room for players to carve out a unique moral stance here, including, of course, taking on a chaotic good role. There's plenty a chaotic good character could do in

  , including challenging oppressive traditions, fighting for vulnerable characters, and making alliances that suit the chaotic good archetype.

 <p>
  Players can create their own custom protagonist, known as Tav, offering maximum choice when determining character style and behavior, or they may choose to embrace one of several of Origin Characters; for example, playing as Karlack, a fiery Tiefling full of determination and passion to help others — even if her methods are unconventional.

  is that it allows players to both explore the busy streets of Night City and also ride on their favorite motorcycle or car through the deserted areas on the outskirts. This allows them to choose to live the quiet life of a Nomad, or surround themselves in excess and perpetual lights as Corpos.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cyberpunk 2077 has one of the most interactive environments of its genre, and it complements that wonderfully with superb voice acting, great weapon sounds, and an outstanding soundtrack. Players who can enjoy this game with headphones should take advantage of this opportunity.

  As they make their way through the busiest streets of Novigrad, players can interact with many vendors, guards, and other NPCs, making the experience feel very realistic and fun. Although the concept of monster-hunting was nothing new when

   Some friendly NPCs let players upgrade and purchase armor and weapons
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If players are looking for a game that allows them to interact with various friendly NPCs,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  is probably not what they want. FromSoftware titles are known for pitting players against insurmountable odds and making them feel like it's them against the world. This means that most of the interactions in this game will be hostile, challenging players’ survival at every turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it keeps players on their toes and makes the gameplay experience interesting. Besides, there are some friendly NPCs that players can talk to for upgrading weapons, purchasing items, and more.

 <p>
  Being a Nintendo game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
   </em>
  </strong>
  is arguably one of the coziest open-world titles out there. Now, this doesn't mean that players won't be tried and tested at every turn as they explore the Kingdom of Hyrule—quite the opposite.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many combat opportunities, lots of things to discover, and various NPCs scattered across the land that make interaction a key aspect of the game. While
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  isn't the first game in its universe to be open-world, it certainly took advantage of modern game mechanics to become a masterpiece.

  has been out for 11 years at the time of writing this article. There are many reasons why it's still popular to this day, and one of those is how much players can interact with their environment. Throughout the game, players can participate in foot, bicycle and even car races, as well as in Rampage shootings, armored truck heists, citizen's arrests, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  The city of Los Santos is full of life and things to do, and considering that it’s a satire of Los Angeles, the game doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is one of its best qualities.

Not only does the game have a compelling narrative and an extremely charismatic leading man, but there are also a lot of things to do throughout the story. No matter where players go, there will always be a chance to interact with the various NPCs scattered across the world.

 <p>
  If players are doing a Low Honor run, they can rob as many innocent people as they want while walking down the street. And if they’re doing a High Honor run, there’s nothing quite as effective to raise it as greeting every citizen of Saint Denis on a beautiful morning. Yet another thing that makes

  An opening line has the opportunity to set the tone for an entire game. Whether it’s an introduction to the story through narration or even simply a cheesy one-liner, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has opened up its games with a variety of different dialogue choices, sometimes being said by the Blue Blur himself, but this is not always the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that this particular series has also gone through plenty of tonal shifts throughout its history, it also means that these introductory lines differ quite a bit in how they set the stage, with some being creepy and unnerving and others being much more lighthearted. Either way, here's a ranking of some of the
  <strong>
   best first lines in the
   <em>
    Sonic
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  , with each standing out for its memorability and relevance to the wider story and characters.

  This particular line is uttered by Doctor Eggman in the first few seconds of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic Forces
   </strong>
   ’
  </em>
  story, and though it might seem simple, it’s honestly a pretty memorable way to kick off the game. In trying to devise yet another plan to take down Sonic for good, Eggman seems to reminisce for a moment about just how many issues the hedgehog has caused him in the past, always preventing the doctor from getting what he wants.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there’s also a slightly creepy undertone to this line, especially when considering that this is the game where Eggman, with the help of Infinite, actually manages to defeat Sonic, even imprisoning him not long after this introductory sequence takes place.

  The Shadow portion of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Generations
   </em>
  </strong>
  remaster hones in on Shadow’s tragic backstory as an experiment of Gerald Robotnik. While aboard the ARK, Shadow loses his closest friend, Maria, and this continues to haunt him throughout the entire story. As a result, this opening line essentially summarizes Shadow’s origins, specifically highlighting where he was created and for what purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s also just useful narration for any new fans who may not have been able to experience
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Shadow the Hedgehog
  </em>
  , and are therefore learning about the hedgehog’s story in real-time. After this line is said, the cinematic then digs a little deeper into the character of Maria and even Black Doom, giving fans everything they need to know before jumping into the first stage.

  , players will be dropped directly into Tropical Resort where they must complete two high-speed missions before eventually being given some context on where they are and how Sonic and Tails ended up there in the first place. Everything becomes much clearer once Eggman delivers this introduction, which perfectly sets up the game and the adventure players are about to embark on.

 <p>

  would become well known for its cheesy dialogue, which many fans came to embrace, and Eggman made sure to put it front and center with this opening line. It manages to be comedic while still emphasizing his greediness and willingness to do literally anything if it gets him one step closer to catching Sonic.

  Sonic Team decided to take a slightly more mature and darker tone with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Frontiers
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with a big focus of the story being placed on the Ancients, an extraterrestrial race who, it is revealed, were entirely wiped out long before the events of the game began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eggman’s opening line during the first cutscene immediately puts the Ancients into frame, but it’s also quite unnerving to see Eggman talking with such authority, rather than the comical dialogue he’s often known for. It also manages to set up the basic foundations of the story with a single line, highlighting Eggman’s connection to the Ancients while also mentioning the mysterious ”secrets” that would be revealed as the game progresses.

  While Shadow was first introduced back in
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  , when he arrives in his own self-titled game, he begins the story with only vague memories of who he is and his tragic past. This line, which is said during the first cutscene of the Hero story, signifies just how deeply troubled Shadow is by his amnesia while also showcasing how he has forgotten his own name, one that continues to “haunt” him.
 </p>
 <p>
  This line creates a clean slate right from the get-go that also feeds into the gameplay, which allows players to take Shadow down different paths in order to acquire multiple unique endings. It’s a line that works well as an introduction and has become somewhat of an iconic quote among the fanbase for how mysterious yet also badass it sounds.

  A callback to the very first game in the series, Sonic shouts this to Eggman while on top of the Tornado as the doctor can be seen carrying a case of small animals in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Lost World
   </em>
  </strong>
  , just as he does in the original game. At the same time, it’s also just such a joy for an opening to feature another bit of banter between Sonic and his arch-rival.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s also a quote that immediately directs the players’ eyes to the screen to see for themselves what Eggman is up to and, more importantly, how Sonic is going to stop him and save the animals. While things quickly go pear-shaped for Sonic not long after this encounter, this line still does an excellent job at getting players right into the action from the very first scene.

  By the time
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic CD
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 1993, the franchise had started becoming well-known for its high-tempo and upbeat music tracks. As a result, the American version of
  <em>
   CD
  </em>
  kicks off with a stunning animation of Sonic racing around a vast open landscape while the now beloved “Sonic Boom” track plays in the background, with the catchy first lines being “If you're strong, you can fly. You can reach the other side of the rainbow.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only does this line hype players up for their next adventure, but it also emphasizes the core of the entire series, that being speed. Having such a stylish intro line also lends itself to Sonic's character who, at the time, was characterized by his cool and laid-back attitude.

  While the pilots of the helicopter keeping Sonic captive do say a few things to one another in the first few seconds of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic Adventure 2
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  this is the very first proper line that is said by a main character in the story. During this era of the games, Sonic was always portrayed as being cool and laid back at all times, and nowhere was this more clear than with this introductory line that the hedgehog says after managing to escape from a mid-flight helicopter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being hunted down by G.U.N. and almost imprisoned, Sonic jokingly remarks that the “low budget flight” and lack of food or movies encouraged him to take a leap of faith with his new makeshift skateboard. It’s a fun reminder of just how calm and collected Sonic always is that he’s able to conjure up such comical lines when the stakes are so staggeringly high.

  An inventive
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has turned their Warlock into Yami Yugi, the protagonist of
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  manga and anime. One of the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  community's favorite activities is to give their Guardians new looks with the wide selection of cosmetics available in the game. These builds impress with the fidelity with which they recreate well-known characters from movies, other games, and anime.

 <p>
  Created by Kazuki Takahashi, the
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  manga debuted in 1996 in Shueisa's Weekly Shonen Jump, and has become a popular work worldwide. It tells the story of Yugi Muto, who is possessed by the spirit of Pharaoh Atem and transforms into Yami Yugi, battling foes in the card game
  <em>
   Duel Monsters
  </em>
  . The manga spawned a prolific entertainment franchise with games, collectible cards, and several
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  anime released over the years. Paying homage to this beloved series, a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  player has made a build inspired by one of its most illustrious characters.

  Redditor most-p-alone went viral by transforming their Warlock into Yami Yugi, with an impressive result. The build stands out for its choice of equipment, especially Hawk's Fury Hood and Clutch Exol Robes, which cleverly recreate the
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  character's clothing and hair design. The build is complete with the default ornament, the Painted Kitsune Boots, and Blood Lineage Blood, giving a similar appearance to the legendary pharaoh, and making their Warlock even tougher. In the comments section, they shared a version of the build without the dueling disk, which has Blood Lineage Gloves in place of the standard ornament.

 <p>
  If the selection of ornaments is noteworthy for the right choices, the same creativity is also shown in the choice of
  <em>

  's shaders. Using Lion's Pride, they make their version of Yami Yugi's hair, while Metro Shift sets the tone for the clothes worn by the character in the anime. Meanwhile, the Ego Malign shader helps create a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  version of the dueling disk that positively wowed the other players, with Princely Presence completing the build.

  The world of anime is one of the recurring inspirations for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players, as previously created builds inspired by Mikasa Ackerman and the Colossal Titan from
  <em>
   Attack on Titan
  </em>
  have shown. For Akira Toriyama fans, a second set turned Warlock into Goku, including the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  protagonist's spiky hair. Inspired by another beloved anime, a third player recreated Jotaro Kujo in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , making their version of the popular
  <em>
   Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
  </em>
  protagonist.

  A prominent
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  leaker has shared news that the hero Blade could be coming to the game in the near future. NetEase Games' upcoming title recently went gold and is preparing for release.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  had a very successful beta earlier in 2024 and is hoping to keep that momentum up through launch.

 <p>
  Marvel's latest game is a third-person team-based hero shooter where players can engage in competitive PVP action. Since its beta,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has been busy announcing new characters and maps. Players will have the ability to choose between 33 heroes and villains at launch. NetEase Games has announced that the game will be released with full crossplay as a feature, but the title will not support cross-progression.

 <p>
  A major
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  leaker, who goes by RivalsLeaks, recently posted that Blade could be an upcoming hero. The leaked image of the famed vampire hunter showed off a bulkier, more muscular version of the character. The iconic hero is sporting a dark trench coat with his signature sword strapped to his back. There were no details about Blade's abilities or which archetype he might fit into. This leak is coming hot off the heels of a similar post about Mr. Fantastic potentially coming to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . It's important to note that leaks are not synonymous with official information. Plenty of games have features, maps, and characters in their files that end up being scrapped entirely.

  The upcoming hero shooter recently announced that PC players could download the game from its official site and on Steam. However, there's no word on when console players will be able to download the game. The ability to pre-load the game has given leakers and dataminers a lot of content to sift through as they search for clues about what may come next for the title. So far, these fans have mostly uncovered new heroes and skins that may come to the game in the future. One post even suggested that Ultron could be coming to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  as a support character.

  NetEase Games has gone to great lengths to attract the attention of players.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is collaborating with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , participating in Twitch drops, giving away a free skin to all players, and releasing exclusive cosmetics for PS5. All of these developments seem like a strategy to pull in as many players as possible for the game's impending launch. With so many announcements and rewards on the table, many fans can't wait to get their hands on the game when it makes its debut on Friday, December 6.

      Ash remains a powerful attacker, especially with the ACOG scope for the R4-C.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the leading tactical competitive FPS, introducing a unique formula to the competitive FPS space. It continues to stake claims in the Esports scene, ultimately making it one of the most watched and played competitive FPS titles.

 <p>
  As with all competitively oriented games, the meta changes rapidly, with new inclusions, strategies, or balancing changes.
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  is no different. These changes keep the game fresh season-to-season and ensure that different operators get a chance in the limelight. Operation Collision Point has shaken up the meta in some areas, introducing and reintroducing some operators to the meta, whilst some others remain steady in their position.

  Thunderbird is a defender, introduced as the first indigenous operator in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  . She is a 2 health, 2 speed operator who uses a healing station gadget. This gadget deploys heals to anyone in its radius, recently being buffed to deliver persistent heals presuming that the player does not take damage.

 <p>
  Thunderbird was always on the weaker side upon her introduction and beyond. This seems to have changed with the buff introduced in Operation Collision Point. The buff to her primary gadget alongside the ability to use the powerful Spear .308 assault rifle has made Thunderbird a solid defense pick.

  Ash is a classic operator, introduced as one of the first attackers in the base game as a representative of the FBI SWAT. She is known for her incredibly useful long-distance breaching gadget, as well as her speed and the ability to use the R4-C.

 <p>
  Ash has always been a solid pick, despite any attempt to nerf her. Players who can utilize her speed to their advantage often dominate gunfights, especially when using the R4-C. The strength of Ash only increased again after she was given the ACOG back for the R4-C.

  Mira is a defense operator introduced in Operation Velvet Shell. Players mainly use the Vector .45 ACP, and this coupled with the secondary shotgun and her one-way Black Mirror gadgets makes her incredibly useful.

 <p>
  Certain sites on some maps, such as Laundry on Oregon, almost require a Mira to defend effectively. She is a must-pick on some maps and continues to prove incredibly powerful against any attacking teams that lack a counter. Her Vector is also incredible, lacking recoil and boasting a very fast fire rate.

  Blackbeard is an attacking operator, originally introduced in Operation Dust Line and reworked in Operation Collision Point. The original Blackbeard went through a turbulent balancing cycle, starting out incredibly powerfully and then being nerfed to the point of irrelevance. The new Blackbeard retains the hard-hitting rifles of the original and has a full-body ballistic shield.

 <p>
  Post-rework, Blackbeard is incredibly powerful in the right hands, boasting all the strengths of a standard attacking shield operator, with the use of a primary weapon instead of a secondary. He can also instantly breach barricades with the shield up, resulting in very powerful rushes and the ability to weight 1v1 duels in his favor with the shield.

  Doc is one of the original defenders in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , consistently remaining a strong pick since the inception of the game. He has incredibly useful stims that can both revive and heal teammates, alongside two equally powerful weapons in the form of the MP5 and the P90.

 <p>
  Doc is the perfect flex pick, allowing for steady anchoring and support through use of his stims. Besides that, more confident Doc players can play more aggressive and peek-heavy, falling back on their stims to recoup any health lost. The versatility of Doc, alongside his powerful weapons, make him one of the better defensive operators in any season.

  Thermite is one of the three main hard-breachers in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  and was the original released alongside the game. He carries the biggest hard-beaching capability, alongside the ability to use either smokes or flashes.

  Whilst Hibana has fallen behind, players are often torn between the use of Ace and Thermite. Thermite is likely the better pick given his smokes and superior rifle. He can also pick flashes if needed. Even though the flash amount has been reduced to 2 with the release of Operation Collision Point, they are still incredibly useful for entry onto the site. As well as this, Thermite only needs one charge in order to create an entirely walkable breach, which means he is far easier to breach with.

  Kaid's Electroclaws are in lower quantities, but they are more versatile than Bandits' batteries, as they can be stuck on any surface. He also carries the incredibly powerful TCSG12 slug shotgun, alongside a nitro cell and a scoped secondary pistol. He has consistently proven to be a great defense pick, likely a hard requirement on most sites. This fact has not changed with Operation Collision Point.

  Dokkaebi is an anti-roamer by nature, but she also excels as an intel gathering operator. She is an attacker introduced in Operation White Noise. She can call and hack defender phones, both scouting out roamers and gaining access to defender cameras if she catches a defender. Dokkaebi has access to a choice of two incredible primaries, alongside the powerful SMG-12 secondary.

 <p>
  Dokkaebi, despite the flash nerfs in Operation Collision Point, is still one of the best attacking operators. She is versatile, packing great damage with her BOSG or MK14, and she has the ability to push fights aggressively through the use of her 3 speed and SMG-12 secondary. Dokkaebi can carry entire rounds, both scouting out roamers and then hacking cameras in order to gain unprecedented intel for her team. If not banned, Dokkaebi is a must-pick for any attackers.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an incredibly popular competitive tactical FPS that added many new elements to the genre with its 2015 release. Map destruction and the one-shot headshot mechanic defined its unique competitive nature, traits that have played a role in it becoming an e-sport.

 <p>
  The last season of Year 9 of
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  is entitled Operation Collision Point and has introduced many much-needed changes. These include operator reworks, new matchmaking elements, and plenty of beneficial balancing changes. Players should ensure they know these key changes before jumping into Collision Point, as many operators and playstyles now work slightly differently, some increasing and others decreasing in power.

 <p>
  Thunderbird is an interesting operator, deploying stationary healing robots that periodically heal a small amount of health to anyone in proximity. Due to the fast-paced, rotation-heavy gameplay in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , this healing often didn't warrant a pick, as most people on defense don't stay in one spot. This made Thunderbird considerably underpowered.

 <p>
  In Operation Collision Point, there has been a crucial change to Thunderbirds healing that may see her pick rate increase. The healing stations heal someone in proximity, as before. However, this buff now applies a periodical heal to the player, regardless of their proximity to the healing station. This healing stops if damage is taken, but presuming damage is avoided, then players can be healed considerably, wherever they are.

 <p>
  Crossplay is a contentious topic in modern gaming, with many games pushing for a completely open matchmaking system that includes all input device types. The issue with
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , however, is that Keyboard and Mouse players boast a significant advantage over Controller players in most instances. Thus, the use of devices that allow for a Keyboard and Mouse on Console has caused much strife for the console community.
 </p>

 <p>
  Operation Collision Point has introduced a solution to this, in the form of a reworked Mousetrap. This system will put any console players caught using a Keyboard and Mouse into PC lobbies. Along with this system, there is also a crossplay system, meaning as long as players' input devices match, they can play together regardless of the system. This means
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  accounts now have two separate ranks; Console and PC.

  For many seasons, shield operators have consistently proved to be a powerful element on the attacking side. Often difficult to kill and annoying to play around, many players have asked for shields to be nerfed to create a more balanced fight.

 <p>
  The main issue of inconsistent melee fights with shields has been fixed in Operation Collision Point. Now, shields cannot kill with their melee, and any incoming melee attack will consistently interrupt the shield melee attempt. This means that shields will now be easier to melee and stagger, resulting in a bigger and more consistent window to kill them.

  Ying has always been a powerful operator, although the recent regular adoption of Ying has brought her power to the forefront of players' attention. Of course, the main issue with Ying is her ability to throw very quick flashes that blind enemies in a large area.

 <p>
  Operation Collision Point has sought to remedy this by removing her ability to deploy instant flashes, extending the time it takes for the flash to fully deploy. This gives defenders a larger window to avoid the flash and fight Ying, allowing more agency to those aware defenders who are quick to avoid the Candelas.

  Sens was first introduced as part of the season entitled, Operation Vector Glare. They deploy ROU Projectors that roll across the floor and extend a sight-obscuring blockade to allow for entry into rooms. Sens was often considered underpowered and very situational, with smokes often proving to be a more valuable entry tool given its position as a secondary gadget rather than a primary gadget.

 <p>
  Operation Collision Point aims to remedy Sens' utility issues, allowing far more freedom and control over the ROU Projectors. Sens players will now be able to choose to bring their vision-blocker up and down at will, also being able to roll the gadget more stealthily with the vision-blocker initially undeployed. This means Sens has far more versatility. For example, the ability to raise the blocker when planting, but retract it in a post-plant scenario.

 <p>
  Blackbeard is an incredibly tenured operator in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , having been through many significant balancing changes. Ultimately, Blackbeard ended up proving quite difficult to balance, always either being too powerful or entirely too weak. For example, early Blackbeard had a nearly indestructible shield on his gun. This was nerfed to the extent that in the seasons leading Operation into Collision Point, Blackbeard's shields were incredibly weak, often breaking in one shot.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1133} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Operation Collision Point has entirely reworked Blackbeard to reinvigorate his playstyle and hopefully make it easier to balance. Now, Blackbeard still wields a primary weapon but also has a ballistic shield that he can drop to an angle to peer above with his primary weapon. Blackbeard can rappel with this shield raised, as well as use it to instantly destroy and enter through barricades. Functionally, Blackbeard plays as a standard shield operator, who wields his primary weapon instead of a pistol. Time will tell how useful this is, but many players believe it to be a very strong change.

  The first stage of coming in for a landing is the approach. This is the point when you are still in the air headed toward a runway. You'll want a clean approach, so give yourself a good amount of distance to begin lowering your altitude with a visual on the runway. Line up the plane with the strip you're going to land on.
  <strong>
   Use the rudder by pressing Q/E or LT/RT
  </strong>
  to center the runway.

 <p>
  Gradually descend and lower your speed by using your yoke. Decrease the throttle so you start heading towards 100 KTAS or below.
  <strong>
   Press F on the keyboard or B on the XBOX
  </strong>
  controller to do so
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  Repeatedly adjust your angle downwards, then center your plane in smooth motion so you don't plummet from the sky.
  <strong>
   Press Forward Slash (/) or Right on the D-Pad to lower your landing gear.

  Once you're over the runway it's time to start decelerating manually. You have a few ways to do this. Completely decrease your throttle by pressing
  <strong>
   F or B.
  </strong>
  If your plane has detents for higher speeds, you will need to
  <strong>
   CTRL + F
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   RB + B
  </strong>
  to slow all the way down. You will also need to adjust your flaps.
  <strong>
   Press B on PC or Down on the D-Pad to increase flaps.
  </strong>
  This will deploy the flaps on your wings. You can increase your flap angle multiple times to decelerate faster.
 </p>

 <p>
  The last bit of deceleration is called Flare. When you are right above the runway,
  <strong>
   Flare the nose of your plane upwards.
  </strong>
  Hold the nose up as you gently touch down on the rear landing gear. This is the trickiest part of landing and will take some practice. Do not whip the nose up into the air violently, or you'll stall. Make subtle adjustments to lift the nose slightly above the horizon, and your landings will get smoother with repetition.

 <p>
  The final stage of landing is braking on the ground. Gently let your front landing gear hit the tarmac.
  <strong>
   Then hold the Space Bar or the X button to apply the brakes.
  </strong>
  Hitting the brakes too quickly can send your plane end over end, so hold the brakes then let go before applying them again to ease the speed down. Once you're at a complete stop, follow the ATC's instructions to taxi to a parking space and end your flight.

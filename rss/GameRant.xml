  </li>
  <li>
   Equip dragons to accelerate their growth by selecting them in the dragon layer screen and pressing the "Equip" button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Feed the dragon by either clicking the "Feed" button in the dragon lair or pressing the "E" key near the dragon and selecting the apple icon.

  There are lots of monsters that come straight from West Virginian folklore in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76.
   </em>
  </strong>
  One of the cryptids that can be found wandering around Appalachia is the Flatwoods Monster. This elusive creature can be difficult to find and even more challenging to kill. With the ability to teleport at will, taking down one of these monsters can be pretty tricky.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Fallout 76,
  </em>
  the Flatwoods Monster is tied to Aliens and Alien Invaders. So, during the Invaders From Beyond event, these creatures can be found quickly and easily. However, outside of this, finding them can be quite time-consuming. However, there are a couple of places players can check out for the chance to find the Flatwoods Monster.

  The chance for the Flatwoods Monster to spawn in a given location is slim. However,
  <strong>
   those odds are slightly greater when searching certain areas at night
  </strong>
  . Some of the locations where you may come across a Flatwoods Monster can be seen below:

 <p>
  There are plenty of other locations where the Flatwoods Monster may spawn, but the ones listed above tend to be the more fruitful places to check out.

 <p>
  Also, as mentioned, during the Invaders From Beyond limited-timed event, players can find multiple Flatwoods Monsters at the top of every hour on every server. The event Campfire Tales can also spawn the Flatwoods Monster as the final boss, but this only tends to happen during the Invaders From Beyond event.

  For those who are having a hard time finding the Flatwoods Monster, there are a couple of daily quests that have a small chance of spawning one. The first one is Making Sacrifices. If you have the Punk Ally stationed at your C.A.M.P., then there's a chance that he will task you with hunting down a Flatwoods Monster. However, you'll need to complete lots of missions for the Punk before this quest can be activated, so it's not the most efficient way of finding the Flatwoods Monster.

 <p>
  The other daily quest that has a slightly better chance of spawning one of these creatures is
  <strong>
   Queen Of The Hunt.
  </strong>
  This daily quest is located in the Mire Region. It sees players searching up to three different locations to find and kill a cryptid for a DNA sample. There's a chance for that cryptid to be the Flatwoods Monster.

  Game Science's action RPG
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  is almost here, and the recent release of its final trailer has built a ton of anticipation for its release date, August 20. In a story based on one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature,
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , players will embark on a one-of-a-kind adventure as the Destined One.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  has been likened to a Soulslike ahead of its release, but its godlike protagonist and fast-paced combat may beg to differ.

  The final trailer for
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is extensive, to put it lightly. Running for close to five minutes, the trailer does everything in its power to pack as much into it as possible, with scene changes that are almost as rapid as the game's combat seems to be. Nevertheless, it does an excellent job of showing fans what
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is made of.

  One of the biggest questions fans have had about
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is whether it will simply be a boss rush game from start to finish or if players will experience the same level of freedom and side content generally found in a standard modern action RPG. Thankfully, Game Science has confirmed that the world would eventually open up for players to meet new NPCs, acquire side quests, and uncover plenty of secrets. Regardless, it's still refreshing to see the final trailer for
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  open with an environmental showcase, as if to reassure the game's followers that its world is much bigger than a mere boss rush.

  The first environment shown in the trailer is a desert landscape, but not before the camera soars through a nearby canyon with stone structures built into its sides. On the right is a large drum that appears near the end of the trailer as well, suggesting it could play an important role in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's gameplay. As the trailer progresses through its first cinematic minute, it becomes clear that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  wants to emphasize the verticality of its world, as each environment features towering cliffs and large mountainous regions. This could be nothing more than a display of the size of its environments and landmarks, but there could be an underlying message revolving around the large-scale conflict within the world and the godlike beings who inhabit it.

  After just a little over a minute into the final trailer, it gives a brief, half-minute glance into the game's combat, including several of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's highly anticipated transformations. The first transformation shown in the trailer has been confirmed by hands-on previews of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  to be obtained after players defeat Guangzhi, a wolf guai who wields a double-bladed flame staff. The Destined One then proceeds to subdue a large group of enemies in a series of frenzied flame strikes using the newly acquired transformation. From there, four more transformations are seen using their unique abilities to vanquish foes in some rather bizarre and brutal ways.

  One of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's transformations shown in the final trailer sees the Destined One throwing snowballs at enemies using two long tentacles. As the enemies are hit by a snowball, they are only briefly stunned, but it may still be long enough for players to flail the Destined One's tentacles around to ensure they go down and remain that way. Two other transformations change the Destined One's head, with one appearing to be a balled-up cluster of corpses and the other resembling a larva. A final transformation for this segment of the trailer sees the Destined One as a beast of some sort who wields a large blade and can breathe fire.

  Every video game world is brought to life by two things: the story and the characters. As so much of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's footage has centered around the game's combat, it's nice to finally see many of the faces the Destined One will encounter during his journey being introduced in the final trailer. Of course, these characters don't appear until after the Destined One is seen meditating near a frozen lake â a feature that players will become familiar with as they progress through
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's narrative.

 <p>
  From the looks of things, the Destined One will be meeting a variety of different characters as he journeys deeper into
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's world, many of them taking on a bizarre and often otherworldly appearance. Some of these NPCs could be friendly and others enemies, but it's too soon to tell. One NPC, in particular, is a human-like tiger who may be one of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's boss fights. What's interesting about this particular NPC, however, is that the final trailer shows him on the ground, seemingly asking the Destined One for mercy. It's entirely possible players could find themselves in a fight against this character, only for him to eventually become a helpful ally to the Destined One.

  Several other characters are revealed in the final trailer for
  <em>

  , including an old man with a large gourd on his back, a person in a cracked white mask, another canine humanoid, a woman in a dark cave seen tossing a dagger in the air, a character wearing what appears to be a white Oni mask, and several others. It feels obvious that some of these characters will be friends of the Destined One while others will be enemies, but that is purely speculation. At the very least, the appearance of so many unique characters in the world of

  While
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  will undoubtedly have a story, its bread and butter will be its strong emphasis on combat, as well as scale because there are reportedly over 80 bosses in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . Nevertheless, given the godlike abilities of the Destined One, there is no better way to show off those skills than against a formidable foe who can take more than a few hits with a staff. In light of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's strong emphasis on combat, the final trailer concludes with one last cinematic montage to show off even more of the game's transformations and Soulslike boss fights.

  Nearly ten more of

  's transformations are put on display for this segment of the trailer, each of which grants the Destined One unique skills, like the ability to become a spirit to avoid an attack or the ability to vanish into thin air. Several other transformations are difficult to interpret, simply due to how quickly the Destined One is moving on the screen. However, this is a testament to
  <em>

  's energetic and fast-paced combat, as it's likely to keep even the most skilled players on their toes.

  Eventually, the trailer ties a bow on it all with over a dozen brief glimpses at many of

One particular scene of a blood moon could be the cinematic introduction to a boss fight, as blood moons are considered a sign of impending doom in Chinese culture.

     One final scene in the trailer occurs after the game's main title appears, in which the Destined One can be seen sitting at a table with the gourd-laden old man who was shown earlier. They sit together, surrounded by a ring of fire that is soon revealed to be a shield protecting them from a nearby enemy. The old man appears to be mentoring the Destined One, so it's likely he will fill this role in the game.

  If the final trailer for

  accomplishes anything, it is that it all but confirms that the game will be more than simply fighting boss after boss. That said, even if it were a boss rush, it would likely still be an engaging experience with what has already been revealed about

  As the wait for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues, theories have been growing about what kind of worlds players can expect to see in the game. The
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  series is well known for its Disney-based maps featured within the games, and as the company continues to grow its reach and buy the rights to various franchises, the possibilities are only growing.

 <p>
  There isn't much known about the state of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  at the moment. Rumors have suggested that the game may not even be released until 2026. Square Enix has yet to make any official confirmation, but the game's secretive development has caused nearly countless rumors and theories to pop up. One of the most prevailing theories about the upcoming action RPG is that
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  will play a role in the game's story with its own world. Although this seems highly likely,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  may merely be testing the waters by crossing over with the sci-fi franchise.

  Star Wars Making Its Way Into the Fold

 <p>
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  has focused on a variety of Disney properties since the genesis of the series. Recurring worlds in the
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  franchise have grown with each installment, and
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  world could likely be set up to start off small and grow larger over time. This wouldn't be the first time
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  has done this, either.
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  's world is a perfect example of this. Originally shown as simply Port Royal in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  expanded upon the world by introducing the Caribbean.

  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas

  is another demonstration of how
  <em>

  has featured certain worlds, only for them to be better fleshed out in follow-up entries. With
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  being a brand-new IP for
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  to explore, leaning more into an experimental mindset with its own world could be the most productive move for the franchise's future.
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  risks making a
  <em>
   Star Wars

 <p>
  Rumors about
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  coming to
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  have been circulating for a long time. Due to the franchise's massive popularity, the crossover feels inevitable, but a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  world would be best served if it leaves players wanting more. Starting small, like focusing a world on just Tatooine or an Ewok colony, could be enough of a sneak peek to be exciting while avoiding being overwhelming. This would also mirror Port Royal's growth into the full-blown Caribbean.

  Too Much Star Wars Risks Overshadowing Kingdom Hearts 4

 <p>
  As one of the biggest franchises in the world, any
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  adaptation gets put under the microscope.
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  adapting
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  while still standing on its own will be difficult to accomplish.
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  can easily overshadow whatever it is featured in, which makes a slow-burn introduction to the franchise in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  a stronger path forward. Slow and steady gives
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  the opportunity to grow along with future
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  games instead of just being a one-off moment that feels more like pandering than any meaningful inclusion.

  players can get Shiny Buzzwole by winning the Buzzwole 5-star raids. The Ultra Beast is known as a powerhouse and is counted among some of the most powerful fighters in the game. Its Shiny variant was a much-awaited addition before its release at the GO Fest 2024.

 <p>
  Defeating Buzzwole as a 5-star raid boss is a challenging task, and once players win the raid, Shiny Buzzwole might spawn nearby. The already potent Buzzwole gets a significant power boost as a 5-star raid boss, making the raid extremely hard to win.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players must carefully select raid counters with move types that fall under Buzzwoleâs weaknesses and avoid the ones it can resist. That said, this guide explores the best way to defeat Buzzwole raids and how to get a Shiny Buzzwole in raids.

  Buzzwole is among the most powerful monsters in
  <em>

  , with a maximum Combat Power (CP) of 3912, which boosts even more as a 5-star raid boss. Its excellent offense potential is reflected through the stat spread of 236 ATK, 196 DEF, and 216 STA. Solo players should avoid the 5-star raid; one should instead team up with others to ensure victory.

 <p>
  Studying Buzzwoleâs weaknesses and resistances is extremely important before selecting the raid counters. The counters must have STAB potential moves that align with Buzzwoleâs weaknesses, not those it can resist. When a counter's attribute and move type are identical, using that particular move triggers the STAB effect.

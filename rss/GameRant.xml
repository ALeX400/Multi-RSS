  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player online has pulled off an accidental "Force Push" kill during combat, which looks like something pulled directly from
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  clip looks like a small bug, but is hilarious nonetheless.
 </p>
 <p>
  A game on the scale of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is bound to have tons of bugs slip through the net, even after years of patches from Rockstar. The main thing is that most of the annoying and game-breaking issues have all been patched out, even if many funny bugs remain. A while back, one weird
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  glitch turned an enemy's body into a huge pile of guns, which was an interesting sight, to say the least. It's possible that some of these bugs are left in on purpose, as they can make for some unique and comical moments that players will remember long after they've left the game behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Redditor online shared a clip of what they described as a "Force Push," showing
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's Arthur pushing an enemy away as they get too close. In the killcam, it doesn't look as if Arthur even touches the enemy, making it look like the famous
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  Force move. It seems to be a glitch where the enemy is just close enough to trigger the melee attack, but far away enough to look like they're doing it with their mind.

  Red Dead Redemption 2 Player Seems To Use A "Force Push"
 </h2>
 <p>
  One player joked that "This is 1% of Arthurâ€™s power if he had more goddamn faith," while another had a theory about what could be causing the issue. It seems that throughout
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's story, there are certain NPCs who are "hardcoded to have cinematic shots when ANY damage is done to them." The same goes for another NPC in Bronte's house at another point in the story, which can then result in some particularly hilarious killcams.

  With Rockstar's focus remaining on the development of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , it's difficult to imagine
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  arriving any time soon. The studio has typically focused on quality over quantity with its titles, and doesn't shy away from large gaps between games if that's what is necessary to get it right. Right now,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is still locked in for a 2025 release, meaning a new
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  game is unlikely until 2030 at the very least, taking Rockstar's current development times into account.

      <title>Elden Ring's Let Me Solo Her Showed Up in Kingdom Come 2, and His Next Appearance Should Be a No-Brainer</title>

 <p>
  Like many FromSoftware titles, the community surrounding
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still massive and deeply dedicated, with the addictive replayability and deep lore of the title still being so conducive to fan-led discussion and debate. While the grueling and unforgiving game world of the title can be a lonely place for players, certain community figures have risen to be massively popular and instantly recognizable, with Let Me Solo Her being one of the best examples of this.

 <p>
  The story of Let Me Solo Her quickly became the stuff of legends within the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community, creating a lasting legacy that is echoed throughout the gaming space to this day. One of the many Easter eggs of the recently released
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  makes a direct reference to Let Me Solo Her's legacy, and it only seems right that this is taken a step further. The upcoming
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  has predictably drawn huge amounts of attention and revamped certain circles of the FromSoftware community, and the project seems like a perfect match for a Let Me Solo Her Easter egg of its own.

 <p>
  Let Me Solo Her is the name of a player character that quickly became a cult-like figure within
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's player base, with the player going viral for consistently helping others as a summonable ally for the game's Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight. With no equipped armor except a jar on their head, Let Me Solo Her showed dizzying skill and tenacity by single-handedly defeating Malenia over and over again for frustrated players, with the sight of this feat being as comical as it was impressive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Malenia is largely considered one of the toughest boss fights in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , even entering the discussion of the hardest bosses across FromSoftware's entire gaming catalog, creating a clear demand for someone like Let Me Solo Her to offer a helping hand to those in need. The unforgettable name and appearance of Let Me Solo Her has led to a level of notoriety around the player that is showing no signs of slowing down to this day, with the recent
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  possessing a fun Easter egg commemorating this element of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  history.
 </p>
 <p>
  The large game world of
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  is jam-packed with Easter eggs relating to different franchises and genre-bending events, with its Let Me Solo Her Easter egg being one of the most recognizable. In the game, players can find the grave of a skeleton with a bucket on its head and a sword in each hand, with this unmistakable get-up being an excellent nod to the iconic
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  figure.

     </em>
     makes reference to other franchises like
     <em>

     </em>
     ,

  The Community Spirit of Let Me Solo Her Could Be Key to a Nightreign Reference
 </h3>
 <p>
  With there clearly being such a long-lasting legacy of Let Me Solo Her that is echoing across the industry, it seems remiss that there has not yet been a direct official reference to the player within a FromSoftware project. While
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion did not feature a nod to Let Me Solo Her, the multiplayer focus of the upcoming
  <em>
   Nightreign
  </em>
  seems like a perfect match in terms of honoring the community spirit of the viral player.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a wide range of ways that this reference could potentially be made in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  , even something as simple as a nod to the figure in a weapon or summon description, being a great way for FromSoftware to bridge the gap between itself and the community. With the spirit and memory of Let Me Solo Her being so clearly alive all these years later, an official reference to the figure seems like it needs to happen, and the co-op-centric gameplay of
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  seems like a match made in heaven for this to finally become a reality.

      <title>One Pokemon Seems All But Guaranteed as a Starter for a Legends Game After Z-A</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-missing-starter-gen-5-snivy-next-game-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </em>
  </strong>
  has thrown a wrench in many fans' starter predictions by announcing that Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the trio players can choose from. Despite the mixed reactions to these starter choices,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  could be just what these less popular mons need to finally stand out. However, in doing so, the
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  series has left out one starter that deserves the same glow-up in the next
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  game after
  <em>
   Z-A
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Not many fans could have predicted two starters from the same generation after
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  set a precedent of pulling starters from three different generations. The benefit of bringing back starters from previous generations is that these mons get a second chance to impress with new forms, like the Hisuian regional variants the starters for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  received, which
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is likely to repeat. With these three mons likely getting new forms in
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , Gen 5's Snivy feels like it's being left out of the fun after the other
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White
  </em>
  starters have been featured in the
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  series.

  Pokemon Legends: Arceus and Legends: Z-A Have Covered Nearly All Gen 2 and 5 Starters
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is adopting two Gen 2 mons as its starters, Chikorita and Totodile, all three original Gen 2 starters will have been featured in a
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  game after Cyndaquil was the Fire-type starter for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  . Gen 5 will now have two of its three starters featured in the
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  seriesâ€”Oshawott in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  and Tepig in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  . Snivy is the only remaining Gen 5 starter to not be featured in a
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  game yet, making it a top candidate for the starter trio of a third
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snivy has never been one of the more controversial startersâ€”neither beloved nor forgotten by fansâ€”which could be why it hasn't received the same attention as other starters like those in the
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  series. However, that doesn't mean Snivy lacks the potential to be a standout critter, especially with the competitive potential its evolution Serperior holds. With its fellow Gen 5 starters getting their time in the spotlight once again, it seems inevitable that Snivy would be afforded that same opportunity.
 </p>
 <h3 id="pokemon-rarely-leaves-one-member-of-a-starter-trio-hanging">
  Pokemon Rarely Leaves One Member of a Starter Trio Hanging
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's a common trend for the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series that if one member of a starter trio gains a new form, the others in that trio also gain new forms. Although exceptions exist, like Charizard receiving two version-exclusive Mega Evolutions, any imbalance in attention is usually swiftly rectified, like when Swampert and Sceptile gained Mega Evolutions in
  <em>
   Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
  </em>
  after Blaziken received a Mega in
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  . As such, if Oshawott and now Tepig are to gain new forms, it's unlikely that Snivy would go without one for long, especially since now Chikorita and Totodile will likely receive new forms to go along with Cyndaquil's Hisuian evolution.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     By this same logic, Litten and Popplio would be in line for new forms as well after Rowlet's Hisuian evolution in
     <em>
      Legends: Arceus
     </em>
     , potentially opening the door for a trio of Snivy, Litten, and Popplio in a third
     <em>
      Pokemon Legends
     </em>
     game.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  While it's unclear if the starters for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will get new Mega Evolutions or simply regional variants like
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , it would upset the starter trio balance if Snivy is left out of the equation completely. As the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise continues to develop the
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  formula, it may become clearer what to expect from the future of this subseries. Whatever that future may be, the franchise would be wise to find a place for Snivy within it.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Delta Force
   </strong>
  </em>
  makes a return after its 15-year hiatus with its latest installment. Also known as
  <em>
   Delta Force: Hawk Ops
  </em>
  , the latest in the series comes for games like
  <em>
   Escape from Tarkov
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  , sporting extraction shooter and large-scale warfare modes side-by-side - and all for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  This list will cover the best of the Assault Rifles but is subject to change as more time is spent in-game, and the clear meta settles down. This list will also cover Assault Rifles across all classes, meaning that not all of these weapons will be available for each class due to certain roles being restricted from certain weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated on March 15th, 2025, by Nathan Halsey:
   </strong>
   Delta Force has entered its second season, adding a new character as well as some balance refreshers. Since this article was originally written, more time has been spent with and around the current arsenal of weapons, and as more is learned of the game, a meta has become clearer. It should also be noted that in Delta Force's Warfare mode, Battle Rifles and Assault Rifles are placed within the same weapon category, having no real distinction aside from having different challenge progression. This article will use the term Assault Rifle to refer to both of them, as the distinction is seldom referenced in the game and within the Warfare community, and the use-case for each weapon is nearly identical.

 <p>
  These weapons arenâ€™t completely interchangeable, but they both fulfill a specific role in the Assault Rifle category: close-range combat. Both of these weapons have very high rates of fire, and very high DPS, but weaker innate Control (which dictates weapon kick).
 </p>
 <p>
  There are minor differences between the two: the
  <strong>
   K416
  </strong>
  has better Control potential, but the
  <strong>
   SG552
  </strong>
  has way better reload speed and hip-fire. Either of these though can be used to dominate close range in spite of these differences, and with fire-rate and equitable damage these guns have seriously low TTK that shines at SMG range.

  The
  <strong>
   CAR-15
  </strong>
  is one of the starting weapons for all classes, and the most versatile of the Rifles, able to use many attachments from other weapons like the M16 and M4A1. It needs a few levels and attachments before its recoil becomes manageable, but when it does itâ€™s a simple weapon that is lightweight and effective at both short and mid-range.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of the existing weapons, this is probably one of the easiest to use; a great weapon for people less confident in their aim once its Control is buffed.

  The
  <strong>
   AKS-74
  </strong>
  is a standout from the jump, and it only gets better with attachments. The driving force behind what makes the AKS-74 so good is its predictability; it kicks hard, but its recoil is almost completely vertical.
 </p>
 <p>
  This makes keeping the recoil a simple downward movement, which in turn makes the weapon much easier to use at range, sporting good damage, and surprisingly good hip-fire, the AKS-74 is a great pick across ranges.

  The
  <strong>
   QBZ
  </strong>
  is a monster at mid-range and one of the best Assault Rifles. In terms of fire rate and handling it feels like a middle-ground between the AKS-74 and the CAR-15. It functions well on both sides of the middle-range spectrum, making it perfect for canted sights and variable zoom.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of this, its high critical damage can make close-range engagements end almost as soon as they start with a lucky headshot. Other than that itâ€™s just easy to use thanks to its good base stats.

  The
  <strong>
   M4A1
  </strong>
  is similar to both the SG552 and the K416 in the sense that its fire-rate is also above average, though of the three, it fires a little slower in exchange for increased stability. However, this minor change has big implications for the way the weapon operates at range, where it substantially outperforms both the SG552 and K416.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the SG552 and K416 function better when treated like submachine guns, the M4A1 can push itself well into assault rifle range with ease while still being a menace in tighter engagements. While this weapon needs a couple of attachments to get itself on its feet, it is extremely powerful and easy to use within its range, so much so that it's locked to the Assault class as it would probably become the go-to if it was available across all classes.

  The

   G3
  </strong>
  has the highest stopping power at the longest range for most of the Warfare leveling experience. Chambered in 7.62x51mm, the G3 is lethal at medium and long range, and stable enough to consistently challenge Marksman Rifles.
 </p>
 <p>
  This weapon is even good at tagging distant Snipers, securing assists, or suppressing them long enough to change position. While this weapon only has a 20-round mag to start,
  <em>
   Delta Force
  </em>
  â€™s low TTK makes this enough to wipe a whole squad, with additional magazine options available later on.

  The

   Scar-H
  </strong>
  is like the G3 in terms of its range and stopping power, but it trades a little of its stability for a faster fire rate. This makes it exceptionally potent at closer ranges as well as longer ranges.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not as proficient as the G3 at pressuring snipers, it is much more forgiving in typical Assault Rifle ranges, as well as at closer range, being able to stand up to submachine guns as well. This allows the Scar-H to be effective right out of the gate, and it only gets better as players put some practice time into using the gun and level it up.

      <title>6 Best Video Game Characters Who Are Multilingual</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-game-characters-multilingual-speak-languages/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Languages in video games often serve more than just flavor text or background noise. For some characters, being multilingual is baked into their history, their skills, or even their survival. While most protagonists are content mumbling in one tongue, there are a few who could probably pass a university-level language exam between boss fights.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Some of these
  <strong>
   multilingual game characters
  </strong>
  use language as a weapon, others as a tool for diplomacy or manipulation, and a few simply because their world demands it. From ancient assassins to modern archaeologists, these are the ones who could hold a conversation in a war zone and still conjugate verbs correctly.

  Players who spent time in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  already know Claude isnâ€™t just another charming tactician with a bow and a grin. As the heir to House Riegan and leader of the Golden Deer, heâ€™s one of the most strategic minds at Garreg Mach Monastery; however, buried beneath all the scheming and sarcasm is a background that makes him one of the most linguistically gifted characters in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Claude was born Khalid, and he didnâ€™t even grow up in Fodlan. He was raised in Almyra, a region that most of Fodlan views with suspicion, if not outright hostility. That cultural disconnect is where his multilingualism comes in. Heâ€™s fluent in both the Almyran language and Fodlanâ€™s tongue, seamlessly navigating both worlds while most of the continent can't even pronounce "Almyran" without gritting their teeth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Itâ€™s not just implied either. Multiple supports, story beats, and even post-timeskip dialogue mention Claudeâ€™s ability to understand and speak different languages, including him actively acting as a cultural bridge between nations. His language skills are woven into his political strategies, his diplomacy, and his entire narrative arc.

 <p>
  Back in
  <em>
   Assassinâ€™s Creed
  </em>
  , before time-traveling DNA memory machines got crowded with side quests and collectible feathers, Altair was quietly rewriting what it meant to be an assassin. Part of what made him so dangerous had nothing to do with his bladeâ€”it was his mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Altair is canonically multilingual, and itâ€™s not a stretch to see why. Born in Masyaf to a Muslim Arab father and a Christian mother, he was raised in a melting pot of faiths, ideologies, and languages. He speaks Arabic, Latin, Greek, and even a form of Old Italian. The
  <em>
   Assassinâ€™s Creed: The Secret Crusade
  </em>
  novel hammers this home, explaining that AltaÃ¯râ€™s education included reading, philosophy, theology, and multiple languagesâ€”a far cry from the grunting mercenaries of most early 2000s games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even within
  <em>
   Assassinâ€™s Creed 2
  </em>
  , when Ezio stumbles upon Altairâ€™s Codex pages, itâ€™s mentioned that the texts are written in a script most canâ€™t decipher without help. Thatâ€™s because Altair didnâ€™t just write in one language. He layered his writings in symbols, ciphered tongues, and esoteric references that required a serious multilingual intellect to even begin decoding.

 <p>
  Navigating interstellar politics in
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  means more than just shooting husks and romancing aliens â€” itâ€™s about talking, negotiating, and, sometimes, threatening your way across a galaxy. Commander Shepard, whether Paragon or Renegade, doesnâ€™t get by on charm alone. Theyâ€™re fluent in more than one language, even if the games rarely rub it in.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  makes use of a Universal Translator for day-to-day conversations, codex entries and developer interviews make it clear that Shepard understands several alien dialects. In fact, the in-universe Alliance military requires soldiers stationed on alien worlds to learn basic communication protocols in multiple languages, especially Turian, Asari, and Salarian.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clearest indicator, though, comes in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2
  </em>
  , during conversations with certain alien squadmates. There are moments when Shepard picks up untranslated phrases and reacts without hesitation â€” no delay, no prompt, just fluent understanding. Itâ€™s subtle, but itâ€™s there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even outside of combat, Shepardâ€™s ability to navigate complex diplomatic encounters between species like the Krogan and Salarians, or decipher old Prothean tech, leans heavily on a multilingual skill set most Spectres probably fail to mention on their resumes.

  In
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , players see just how far multilingualism can go when itâ€™s weaponized. Big Boss, also known as Venom Snake or Naked Snake, is fluent in Russian, English, Spanish, French, and Pashto. However, unlike most
  <strong>
   multilingual video game characters
  </strong>
  , he didnâ€™t learn languages to connect cultures. He sought to control them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout
  <em>
   MGS 5
  </em>
  , language is treated as a literal vector for control, manipulation, and even biological warfare. The vocal cord parasites storyline hinges on the idea that language itself can be weaponized. The parasites target speakers of specific languages, and Snake's multilingualism becomes critical in navigating a world where language is a potential death sentence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Big Bossâ€™ ability to understand multiple dialects is constantly reflected in intel briefings, cassette tapes, and the way he interacts with locals and soldiers. His Diamond Dogs arenâ€™t bound by nation or creed, but theyâ€™re united by the shared ability to communicate under his command.

  Thereâ€™s a reason most bards in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  universe write about Geralt. Heâ€™s a walking contradiction â€” gruff but intellectual, reserved but poetic, and when heâ€™s not slicing down a chort, heâ€™s quietly showing that he speaks more languages than most royal courts combined.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  games primarily operate in Common Speech, itâ€™s well-documented in the novels and scattered game lore that Geralt speaks Elder Speech fluently, a language used by elves, dryads, and high mages. However, it doesnâ€™t stop there. Heâ€™s conversational in Nilfgaardian, Skellige dialects, and even has a working understanding of gnomish and dwarven tongues.
 </p>
 <p>
  This comes up more often than players might realize. In
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  , there are dialogue moments where Geralt slips into Elder Speech casually, especially when speaking with sorceresses or non-human characters. Thereâ€™s no translation needed â€” he just understands, replies, and moves on, like itâ€™s second nature. Because to him, it is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering his constant interactions with cultures that actively resent each other, his ability to converse across boundaries without sparking another war is probably his most underrated talent. That, and resisting the urge to punch Dandelion.

  Thereâ€™s multilingual, and then thereâ€™s Lara Croft. Across multiple timelines and reboots, sheâ€™s consistently portrayed as someone who could probably pass for a historian, a cryptographer, and a museum curatorâ€”before breakfast.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  reboot trilogy, her linguistic skills are woven into the core gameplay. Players gradually level up her language proficiencies by finding murals, inscriptions, and ancient relics. Whether it's Greek, Mongolian, or Mayan, Lara doesnâ€™t just read the text but translates it in real-time, unlocking new lore and puzzles along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  That mechanic isnâ€™t just for flavor either. Itâ€™s a direct reflection of Laraâ€™s academic background. She was educated at prestigious institutions like Gordonstoun and Newnham College, Cambridge, and her journals across multiple titles constantly reference her self-taught language training. In
  <em>
   Shadow of the Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , she even holds conversations in Yucatec Maya, without a translator in sight.

      <title>Embracer Cancels Sale of Two Development Studios</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/embracer-cancels-sale-4a-games-zen-studios/</link>

 <p>
  Embracer has announced that the proposed sales of
  <strong>
   4A Games
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Zen Studios
  </strong>
  have been canceled and will stay with the conglomerate after all. Embracer is a Swedish video game and media holding company that was first established in 2011, taking control of IPs of bygone publishers like THQ and JoWood. The company then grew in size, to the point that it became a public company in 2019. It then began purchasing and acquiring a number of studios throughout 2023, rapidly growing further, acquiring the likes of
  <em>
   Metro
  </em>
  developer 4A Games and
  <em>
   Pinball
  </em>
  developer Zen Studios.

 <p>
  The momentum of the Embracer Group's acquisitions came back to bite the conglomerate in a big way, due to the series of acquisitions making it infeasible to fund all the projects that it had under its umbrella. As such, several companies were shut down, many employees were laid off, and games were canceled. Several of these studios include the likes of Volition and Free Radical Design, with the Embracer Group restructuring itself after failing to acquire a multi-billion dollar deal with Saudi Arabia. Some of its acquired studios also had to be sold off, such as Saber Interactive for $247 million. However, it's been reported that Embracer will be retaining two development studios from this original sale, which are the aforementioned 4A Games and Zen Studios.

 <p>
  In a statement released by Embracer, it was announced that the pair of development studios will be staying with the conglomerate. 4A Games and Zen Studios were originally included in the $247 million dollar deal when Embracer was selling Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, a new company formed by Saber co-founder Matthew Karch. Due to an early repayment and divestment of assets from Saber Interactive, it helped Embracer's cash flow, and allowed all commitments related to this transaction to be settled. "We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey," said Lars Wingefors, co-founder and CEO of Embracer.

  Embracer is still restructuring itself after the fallout of its failed 2 billion dollar investment, having split into three separate publicly traded companies. While former Embracer acquired companies like Shiver Entertainment were bought by Nintendo, others like
  <em>
   Alone in the Dark
  </em>
  developer Pieces Interactive and Piranha Bytes were shuttered, with the latter being closed down as recently as June 2024.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a faithful remaster that brings the PSP classic to a new audience. While the visuals are vastly improved, the combat and the materia system received minor changes from the original, mostly involving bug fixing. That was for the best, as the materia and equipment system are what really make the game shine.

 <p>
  There's plenty of powerful materia and equipment combinations to be had, many of which can be obtained early in a playthrough. Endgame opens up these possibilities even more, leading to a number of overpowered builds.

  This one isn't so much a build as a collection of things players can obtain early on to make easier progress. Most of the items and materia above can be obtained as early as chapter 2, and all of them can be won, bought, or fused before the end of chapter 3. Focus on side missions (essential missions listed above) and mastering an HP Up and elemental materia or two early on.

 <p>
  Make use of the materia fusion system to create higher tiers of mastered materia. Use this to fuse firaga, thundaga, or blizzaga early. Use poison or silence to fuse the dark versions, and inflict these status effects on enemies. Use physical materia to make the "Blade" versions so you can choose to spend AP instead of MP.

 <p>
  With these, HP Up, and Barrier, players should be able to push the harder 5-6 star side missions to get Mog's Amulet, Wizard Bracelet and Quake early. With all of these in hand before the end of chapter 3, players can be highly overpowered until mid-game.

  To get overpowered in the mid-game, the most essential item is the "Brutal" accessory, as it lets you deal up to 99,999 damage. To get it, you need to clear all the "Seeking Precious Items" side missions up to M7-4-6. This can be done as early as chapter 4 and will help with clearing all the missable missions before the chapter 7 point of no return.

 <p>
  Pairing Brutal with Graviga, which deals 50% of the opponent's HP as damage, is the earliest way to do enormous damage to bosses without stat boosting. Darkness will also let players break the damage cap, at the cost of HP. Pairing it with HP Up++ and Smart Consumer for boosted healing can help make this a non-issue.

 <p>
  This build also gives significant damage negation. Status Ward and a hell elemental spell give immunity to poison, silence, stop, and death. The Wizard Bracelet nullifies elemental damage and heals the player instead. Players might still want Barrier for extra physical damage reduction — and dispel to negate boss buffs.

 <p>
  Players can acquire this build between chapters 7 and 10 and use it as a basis to acquire powerful endgame items like the Genji Set. With the Soul of Thamasa, Dualcast can be used without restraint. This means that high damage black magic spells like Electrocute and Tri-fire become viable without a huge MP pool. It also makes Curaga plus Dualcast a viable healing method.

 <p>
  Costly Punch ignores enemy defense stats and barrier buffs, and it doesn't rely on the attack stat for damage. It costs HP instead of AP, but with max HP at 99,999 (thanks to the Adamant Bangle), that can be mitigated with healing without leaving players open to 1-shot deaths.

  To use this build to effectively clear late game content, players will also need to make extensive use of the materia fusion system to increase the stat bonuses granted by their materia, as well as the Ziedrich Accessory, focusing on MAG, VIT, SPR and HP.

 <p>
  Minerva is one of the toughest optional boss fights in the game. This build makes the fight a little smoother. Costly Punch can be swapped for any move that can deal 99,999 damage, but it's the easiest option, as other moves introduce AP or MP management to the fight.
 </p>

 <p>
  Mug can be used once, at the start of the fight, to get a full stack of Phoenix Downs, which will be useful for restoring the auto-life status when Minerva's special, Judgement Arrow, removes it. Aerial Drain gives the player the option to keep up damage while healing, and SP master will boost the damage.

 <p>
  The most difficult part of the build is obtaining the Genji set items, then grinding materia fusion for maxed out stats. It's worth the effort, though; once Minerva is dead, nothing else in the first game cycle can offer a challenge.

 <p>
  This build offers several key advantages that let players breeze through New Game+. It can hit for max damage against any enemy type (multiple times), it offers immunity from most damage types and significant reduction of any damage that does get through, and it negates or manages most resource costs.

 <p>
  Heike Soul does a lot of the heavy lifting for the build, especially the Dualcast effect, and is well worth the cost of permanent curse status. Players will also need to max their stats via materia fusion, but that isn't much of an issue at this stage in the game.

    <ul>
     <li>
      Different environments offer immersive settings for games beyond typical city or woodland backgrounds.

 <p>
  Settings of all kinds can be perfectly suitable as they are, whether they be a tame fantastical woodland or a typical city. However, these environments can sometimes blur and become nothing more than a necessary background. Harsher environments, such as deserts or frozen wastelands, can offer a more immersive and tactile setting for players, grounding the overall experience.

 <p>
  World War 2, for example, can immediately settle a player into the experience when handled tastefully. However, WW2 as a setting can, more recently, feel a little stale due to how often it tends to be used. In the spirit of variety, these games all feature more original settings that are relatively far from reality.

  This story-driven, relatively linear RPG features strategic turn-based combat and a beautifully-realized post-apocalyptic setting. The game takes place on a "post-human Earth" inhabited by Mutants, who also double as the game's protagonists.

 <p>
  Throughout the game, players adventure across a variety of overgrown urban environments and woodlands, competing with a cast of challenging enemies and slowly discovering more about the game's post-apocalyptic world. Combat is turn-based and tactical, but players can use stealth mechanics to set up the perfect ambush beforehand, adding an extra layer of strategy to the experience.

   Dawn Of War
  </em>
  is a real-time strategy game that makes full use of its source material. The variety of factions to play and immersive campaigns, heightened by talented voice acting, are particular stand-outs.

  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  is a tactical turn-based strategy game that revolves around managing a party of four heroes in a class-based RPG system, battling through a variety of unforgiving dungeons in a brutally unforgiving rogue-like structure. The game features a stark, Gothic, hand-drawn art-style that perfectly encapsulates its brutal gameplay, painting a vivid picture of its harsh world.

 <p>
  The ever-dwindling light of the torch must constantly be cared for, as to not fall into complete, panic-inducing darkness, and keeping the dungeon illuminated is just one of the many things that players must manage. Stress, environmental hazards, and the vicious, Lovecraft-inspired enemies themselves bring a constant sense of dread to the overall experience.

  Complete and utter freedom is

  <em>

  , and anything can kill them in its take-no-prisoners world. Actually, that's somewhat inaccurate, as players can and will often be taken prisoner and enslaved by one of the game's most infamous factions.

  Players can approach

  from all manner of directions, and the game allows players to explore and interact with its world freely. Base-building, stealth, trading, and simply exploring are all par for the course in
  <em>

  . The strategy comes along with the game's squad-based mechanics and real-time-with-pause combat in which players micromanage multiple units at a time in encounters that can vary drastically in scale.

  Taking place on the sparkling, melange-dusted sands of Arrakis (otherwise known as Dune),
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  is a real-time 4X strategy game that makes the best of its evocative science-fiction setting. From the variety of playable factions, each featuring their own thematic strengths and weaknesses, to the inclusion of spice harvesting and the iconic sandworms,
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  is a tremendously immersive experience that's perfect for fans of the classic novels.

 <p>
  The multitude of victory conditions and myriad paths to each of them is one of
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars'
  </em>
  most notable features. Meanwhile, the brilliant faction variety and the diversity of gameplay options within each of their tool-sets gives the game its replay value. It's no surprise that
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  is, like the "spice melange" of its source material, massively addictive, especially once players have learned its intricacies.
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  was developed by Shiro Games, developers of the Norse-inspired strategy game,
  <em>
   Northgard.
  </em>
  Their aptitude for design is on full display here.

  The Black Cat collab from Marvel x
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  comes with 6 items, with the most interesting of the bunch being the outfit of the expert thief and skilled martial artist herself, Black Cat. Black Cat's iconic fascination with Spider-Man is hard to understate, and it seems that her interest in the Web-Head is more than just that of a cat with a playful ball of yarn. The outfit comes with a mask on and a mask off style, and it completes the stellar look of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's own art style with Marvel's characters, providing the game with yet another great skin from the Marvel roster.

  Players can get Black Cat for 1,500 V-Bucks and the rest of her cosmetics for a total of 3,600 V-Bucks. However, they can receive all of her items, skin included, if they purchase the Black Cat Bundle for 2,300 V-Bucks.

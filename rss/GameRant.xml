      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Dev Describes the Mage Specializations</title>

 <p>
  With the official reveal of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  , one of the biggest questions on fans' minds is Rook's class specializations. Every class in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  has three specializations, and thus far, the Warrior and Rogue specializations have been detained in full. Now,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's director Corinne Busche has described the Mage's specializations, without confirming what they are outright.

  BioWare and EA recently hosted a Discord Q&amp;A for the community, answering many questions about
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . Understandably, one question was tied to the Mage Specializations and the potential use of Blood Magic for Rook. Busche's answer was intriguing and exciting for Mage fans of the franchise.

 <p>
  Blood Magic is off the table for Rook, although it will likely have some role in the larger game. Busche did not explain exactly why Blood Magic can't be used by Rook, except that Rook has a special reason to avoid Blood Magic. It'll be interesting to see how that shakes out, but when it comes to types of magic Rook can use, Busche did roughly describe the three specializations. Players will be able to pursue a specialization surrounding
  <strong>
   elemental spells, necromancy spells, and combat magic
  </strong>
  . Specifically for the latter, she described it as a "Combat Mage" role.

  While fans wait for more details, each should be able to help players determine their general approach. Elemental spells will likely go a long way in standard magic, while Necromancy has been used in many ways. Perhaps fans will be able to get a skeleton companion like Emmrich's Manfred, though that's not confirmed at this time. Furthermore, there have been a couple of Combat Mage specializations in the past.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  had the Arcane Warrior, while
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  had the Knight-Enchanter. It's possible one of these returns, or it's just as likely to be a new take on the Combat Mage approach. At the very least, it does sound like there's at least one build to get Mages on the frontline instead of the back one.

  Fans can expect more information as the game gets closer to release. While there's no confirmed release date for

  </em>
  yet, more information is promised this summer and heading into its release window of Fall 2024. Fans will just have to wait for BioWare to detail these in full, alongside all the other questions still lingering around

  Hot Wheels Unleashed isn't only the most polished Hot Wheels experience ever, but it is also one of the best racing games currently out there. The arcade racer is gaining popularity due to its stylized yet fun gameplay, which provides dozens of creative options. Externally, it might seem like the game is just a marketing stunt made to advertise actual Hot Wheels products. But at its core, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a polished game that has both quality and quantity. There are 60 vehicles in the game, but not much info is available on which cars are best.

 <p>
  After playing the game for roughly 500 hours, a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  player discovered that stealth works just as effectively while battling Cyberpsychos as any other enemy. In the world of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , cybernetic enhancements are incredibly common among the criminal element of Night City, giving aspiring edgerunners and gang enforcers alike access to incredible superhuman abilities. However, this technology can come at a dangerous cost: those who equip too many enhancements risk succumbing to Cyberpsychosis, a condition that causes hallucinations and increased aggression.

 <p>
  In fact, one of V’s side tasks in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is tracking down and eliminating some of these “Cyberpsychos” on behalf of the Fixer Regina Jones. Once they find one of the 17 Cyberpsychos rampaging through Night City in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , the player can choose between killing them outright or subduing them through non-lethal means. Either way, these Cyberpsychos don’t go down easily, with V having to overcome each of them in a challenging mini-boss battle.

  That is, unless they learn a secret that Reddit user RandomNightCityViews did after playing
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  for nearly 500 hours and take them out using stealth. During a fight with one of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  ’s rampaging Cyberpsychos, RandomNightCityViews tried sneaking around the field of battle using cover and managed to approach their target, snapping their neck from behind. RandomNightCityViews was pleasantly surprised that this tactic worked, as were many of the other Reddit users in the comments section of their post on r/cyberpunkgame.

 <p>
  Some of RandomNightCityViews’s fellow Reddit users also playfully chided them for killing the Cyberpsycho rather than using the available non-lethal takedown, as some of them are tragic victims of circumstance in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  - not to mention Regina offering a greater reward for keeping them alive. Meanwhile, others shared their own found methods for dealing with Cyberpsychos, such as Netrunners disabling their enhancements with quickhacks.

 <p>
  This is all a testament to how
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  allows players to shape their version of V however they see fit, from customizing their appearance from the ground up to deciding how the aspiring edgerunner handles dangerous situations like battling a rampaging Cyberpsycho. While these challenging opponents can be taken down with a decent weapon, more crafty players can indeed utilize their stealth skills to eliminate the threat – though RandomNightCityViews might have been better advised to simply knock the Cyberpsycho out for the extra bonus rather than execute them outright. More tricks and tactics like this will probably surface as players wait for the eventual
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  sequel.

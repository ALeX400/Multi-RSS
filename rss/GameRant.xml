 <p>
  A new job listing at CD Projekt Red hints that the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  sequel could have more photorealistic textures. It was a long and complicated road for
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , with the game having a notoriously lengthy development cycle followed by one of the most controversial launches in recent memory. In the years since then, CDPR worked to patch up the worst of the many bugs and glitches that plagued
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  in the beginning, eventually culminating in the release of the
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  DLC last September.

 <p>
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  would be
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  ’s only story-based DLC, and CD Projekt Red announced that it would be moving forward with a full-on sequel instead of expanding on the original further. Ever since the tentatively named “Project Orion” was first revealed in the fall of 2022, fans have been speculating on how this
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  follow-up will build on the open-world RPG format of its predecessor. There are plenty of rumors and leaks out in the wild already, but the only thing that is known for sure is that the
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  sequel will be built using Unreal Engine 5 by CD Projekt North America.

 <p>
  This could lead to
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  ’s eventual sequel having more life-like visuals, and a recent job listing at CD Projekt supports this notion by mentioning more photorealistic textures. More specifically, it calls for a Senior Environment Artist to work with the Environment Team for Project Orion. The candidate would be in charge of “building incredible worlds that players will deep dive into” by creating “high-quality 3D models” and “photorealistic textures” using various tools and middleware.

 <p>
  This seems to imply that CDPR is aiming for a more cinematic look for the next
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  title. Another job listing from back in March lends credence to this by asking for a Lead Cinematics Designer who would help make Project Orion look and feel like a blend of film and game. The first
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  seemed to aim more toward immersing players in the gritty world of Night City rather than trying to emulate cinema, allowing players to freely move the camera during conversations with NPCs at the price of not having as many cinematic cutscenes.

 <p>
  All signs point to Project Orion shifting toward a more cinematic presentation, and judging from this latest job posting, it might be supplemented by more photorealistic textures. The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  already did a great job of giving players a gritty, neon-filled futuristic dystopia to explore, and it will be interesting to see how the in-development sequel could add more life-like characters, buildings, and vehicles.

  According to its ESRB rating, the upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
   </em>
  </strong>
  will include in-game purchases, something that wasn't present in the 2006 original.
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  is an enhanced version of the original
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  game. While not quite a full-blown remake,
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  is making some significant changes to the original
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  experience.

 <p>
  Capcom recently provided a deep dive into the upcoming game, confirming
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  features improved graphics compared to the original version. The game will also feature auto-saves and various other quality of life improvements so that it better matches today's standards. Overall, though,
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  looks to be providing an experience that's not far off from the 2006 game, which has made hardcore fans of the franchise excited.

 <p>
  Another change
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  will be making compared to the original game is its inclusion of in-game purchases. This was confirmed by the
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  ESRB rating, which has given the game an M for Mature rating for Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Language, and Use of Alcohol, with a separate note that the title includes in-game purchases. Now, what exactly the
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  in-game purchases will consist of remains to be seen. Capcom includes microtransactions in many of its games, and they range from cosmetics to things that can actually give players a gameplay advantage, so who knows what
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  will do with its in-game purchases.

  One distinct possibility is that
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  will sell premium cosmetics. As it stands, no such cosmetics have actually been revealed, but fans do know of three exclusive skins they can get if they pre-order the game.
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  pre-order bonuses include a Frank West skin that makes the game's main character look like he did back in 2006, as well as a skin that lets players dress up as the Willamette Parkview Mall Bee mascot. The third skin lets players take on the guise of Chuck Greene, the protagonist of
  <em>
   Dead Rising 2
  </em>
  . These skins will only be available to those who pre-order, but it wouldn't be surprising if they were eventually sold individually.

  Ultimately, fans will have to wait for Capcom to share its plans for

  </em>
  in-game purchases for itself, and there really is no telling when that may happen. Capcom added pay-to-win microtransactions to the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake post-launch, after all, and so it's possible
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  fans won't know until some time after the game comes out on September 19.

  The next update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be officially adding the game's first-ever Mythic Weapon Skin to its cosmetic pool.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has long offered players the chance to customize the weapons of the various playable heroes in the game. Certain skins can dramatically change the appearance of weapons, but
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players have also been able to give their weapons some added shine using Competitive Points.

 <p>
  By playing
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Competitive Play mode, players have been able to unlock Competitive Points that in turn can be spent on Gold and Jade weapons. Now there's a brand-new kind of weapon skin in the game, which users will be able to purchase once the store refrehses.

  The Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin is available in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as of the hero-shooter's latest update. The base skin costs 50 Mythic Shards, with three levels of effects "including weapon flourish, elimination effects, and reactive effects" that can be unlocked for additional Mythic Shards.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players can purchase the Mythic Weapon Skin by itself, but they can also buy the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle, which includes the base weapon, 2,000 Overwatch Coins and 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. Pricing information on the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle is unavailable at the time of this writing, but it should be showing up in the shop shortly.

  Needless to say, Reinhardt mains in
  <em>

  should consider picking up the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin. Mythic Shards are a precious commodity, but if there are no Mythic Skins that players feel like buying at the moment, then it wouldn't hurt to get the Mythic Weapon Skin instead. And for those that don't play Reinhardt, there should be new Mythic Weapon Skins for them to look forward to on the horizon.

 <p>
  Blizzard did not reveal the next hero that will receive a Mythic Weapon Skin in
  <em>

  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 launches on August 20. It's possible that the next Mythic Weapon Skin will be added as soon as the season starts, but there's also a chance that it will be added later, as was the case with the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin and Season 11.

  On July 23rd, NetherRealm Studios will release the final DLC character for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Fighter Pack in the form of Takeda Takahashi. Fans of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat X
  </em>
  have been excited about Takeda’s return, as he hasn’t been playable since the 2015 fighting game’s base roster. However, with
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  being set in a new universe created by Titan Liu Kang, several characters had their origins and appearance changed, such as Reptile and Scorpion, and Takeda was not withheld from this fate. In this new universe, Takeda is no longer the son of the swordsman Kenshi Takahashi, but is rather his cousin.

 <p>
  Takeda was first introduced in the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat X
  </em>
  digital comic series' first volume,
  <em>
   Blood Ties
  </em>
  , a few months prior to the game’s release. Here it was revealed that Takeda was the son of Kenshi and a woman named Suchin shortly after the events of 2011’s
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  . Kenshi worked with Earthrealm’s Special Forces to go undercover in the Red Dragon crime syndicate, but eventually, his cover was blown. The Red Dragon killed Suchin but Kenshi managed to save Takeda, bringing him to the newly restored Shirai Ryu clan for protection under their grandmaster, Hanzo Hasashi, otherwise known as Scorpion.

 <p>
  For years, Takeda was trained directly by Scorpion and eventually reached the title of Chujin among the Shirai Ryu. Following this promotion, Kenshi returned and told his son about his innate telepathic powers with the intention of the two working together to take down the Red Dragon. Eventually, Takeda became part of the Special Forces alongside his father and joined a squad composed of Cassie Cage, Jacqui Briggs, and Kung Jin, relatives of Johnny Cage, Jax Briggs, and Kung Lao respectively. Together, Takeda and his squad attempted to secure Shinnok’s amulet and eventually helped Cassie defeat Shinnok once and for all.

  Takeda’s History Post Mortal Kombat X
 </h3>
 <p>
  By the end of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat X
  </em>
  , Takeda begins a relationship with Jacqui Briggs. While Briggs returns to the playable roster for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  , Takeda is notably absent. Despite his physical absence, Takeda is referenced numerous times in fight intro dialogue by Cassie, D'Vorah, Fujin, Jacqui, Jax, Katana, Kotal Kahn, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, and even the guest fighter Joker. Most conservations suggested Takeda was on a classified mission while Scorpion and Jacqui’s dialogue hinted that Takeda proposed to Jacqui. However, Joker suggests that he tortured and may have killed Takeda before this timeline was erased.

  Takeda wasn’t limited to the DLC of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  as he and other members of the colloquially Kombat Kids squad from
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  briefly appeared in the climactic battle of the Pyramid of Argus in Titan Shang Tsung’s dimension. During the battle, Takeda and his companions are killed by Titan Kitana. It’s unknown which dimension these Kombat Kids come from, but this Takeda is in the same form as the DLC fighter, while Cassia and Jacqui are in their
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  appearances and Jin has a new character model. Given Jin’s new character model, he may appear as a part of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ’s second wave of DLC fighters or in a new role in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  alongside Takeda.

 <p>
  According to NetherRealm,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Takeda was raised by the Yakuza alongside Kenshi and was eventually dispatched to kill his cousin when he abandoned the crime syndicate. Kenshi defeated Takeda and took him to the newly formed Shirai Ryu clan under Kuai Liang Scorpion’s tutelage. With the Shirai Ryu teachings, Takeda is now dedicated to taking down the criminal underworld of Earthrealm. Based on this info, Takeda could serve as a new guiding member of the Shirai Ryu, potentially inspiring the young Hanzo Hasashi as a reverse of their original roles. Takeda could even bring Jin into the Shirai Ryu, if the two are still the same age, to prepare for the inevitable conflict with Bi-Han Sub-Zero and the Lin Kuei.

  The first step toward obtaining Barreled Crude Oil is establishing a territory in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  that is situated within an oil field. For the uninitiated, oil fields are areas where players can find pumpjacks working the ground, and there are several of them in Red Sands. The map that is above showcases the precise positions of three of those areas, and they are all great options for fans who are looking to accumulate Barreled Crude Oil.

  After a player moves their territory into an oil field, they should build Water Pumps and connect them with wires to some type of power facility. For full clarity, Water Pumps and Solar Panels can be made accessible by unlocking the associated Tier 3 Logistics Memetics in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , and wires can be run between them by interacting with the generator, pressing "X" to start a wire, approaching a pump, and pressing "X" again to attach the wire to it.

  With power flowing to the Water Pumps, players must simply wait while the machine extracts Barreled Crude Oil from the ground. Notably, this is quite a slow process, with the Water Pump extracting a resource every five minutes, and fans of survival games should busy themselves with another activity while they wait for the Crude Oil to accumulate.

  After collecting a minimum of 10 Barreled Crude Oil, players can put the material into a Refining Facility. That facility is made accessible by unlocking a Tier 2 Infrastructure Memetic, and it can convert 10 Crude Oil into five Portable Mixed Fuel in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan shared their original concept for a legendary Siva ornament for Warlocks to use. This class lacks a Siva ornament, prompting one creative
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  fan to design and share their own with the rest of the game's community.

 <p>
  While tight, satisfying gunplay and exhilarating combat encounters are
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's bread and butter, fans also enjoy the game for the sheer amount of variety and creativity it allows for.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  offers a total of three playable classes for players to pick from, including Hunter, Warlock, and Titan. However, a wide range of subclasses fall between these three main choices, allowing players to customize their experience to their liking. One of the game's main draws is the sheer number of powerful weapons players can acquire, though there are a ton of armor sets fans can get their hands on as well, making fashion a big part of the overall
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  experience. Players can mix and match various colors and pieces to create their own unique themed characters, with one fan designing their own legendary ornament.

 <p>
  Due to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  lacking a legendary Siva ornament for the Warlock class, Reddit user mrHDash_ decided to create their own, sharing their concept with the rest of the game's online community. Players can use Armor Synthesis in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , the game's version of “transmog,” a feature that grants players the ability to use unlocked armor to create Universal Ornaments for a certain class. No legendary Siva ornaments exist for Warlocks currently, but this did not stop a fan from making their own.

  Siva is something longtime
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  fans will recognize. During the original
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Rise of Iron
  </em>
  expansion, players learned of a long-lost force that humanity had a hand in creating. Siva, the Warmind-creating nanomachines, devoured several Iron Lords but have been notably absent from
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  despite being relatively popular among the community, with this concept bringing back Siva in an incredibly cool way. In other news, players are still reeling from
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's massive
  <em>
   The Final Shape
  </em>
  expansion, which adds to the game's lore, armor sets and selection of weapons considerably. Designed specifically for fans,
  <em>
   The Final Shape
  </em>
  takes
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  to new heights, welcoming all to bear witness to the end of the Light and Darkness saga that started a decade ago.

  Xbox's highly anticipated fantasy RPG
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  is reportedly being pushed out of 2024, instead aiming for an early 2025 release. One of Xbox's three major triple-A 2024 releases alongside the well-received
  <em>
   Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
  </em>
  and the yet-to-be-released
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is in development at Obsidian Entertainment, the studio known for acclaimed RPGs like
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Obsidian's first-person fantasy RPG has been making the showcase rounds in the lead-up to its planned release this year.
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  had a major presence at the Xbox Developer Direct back in January, where Obsidian showed off one of the game's early ocean-themed areas, Shatterscarp. The extended gameplay slice also showcased
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's first-person combat, the ability to wield a combination of different weapons and arms, and some of the game's powerful magic abilities. However, a release window wasn't given until
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  appeared once again during June's Xbox Games Showcase 2024 with a story trailer, letting Xbox fans know they could expect the game later in 2024.

 <p>
  Now, at the beginning of August, Tom Warren of The Verge has come out with a new
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  rumor, claiming that Xbox and Obsidian are now looking to delay the fantasy RPG to early 2025. Warren elaborated that this potential delay wouldn't be due to the game not being ready, as he claims the title is "in good shape." Rather, the push would be a way to give other big Xbox Game Pass games more room to shine in a crowded November and December.

  The final three months of 2024 are stacked for Xbox Game Pass subscribers.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  will be the first ever
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  title to launch on release day on the service in October.
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  is gearing up for its November 19 release, and just a day later,
  <em>
   STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  is set to release on November 20. On top of that, current rumors are pinning
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  for a release at some point in early December.
  <em>
   STALKER 2'
  </em>
  s recent delay from September 5 to November 20 may be a leading factor in Xbox's rumored delay of
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  into 2025.

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  were pushed to next year, many are considering the already massive slate of 2025 Xbox games on the docket. Currently,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   South of Midnight
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  are all officially stamped with 2025 release windows;
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Clockwork Revolution
  </em>
  are also rumored to be 2025 titles. Even with all of these major first-party Xbox games filling the 2025 calendar, there may be proper room for
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  in January or February, as
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  may be an April or May title based on the series' past releases. Xbox fans should stay tuned for more news regarding
  <em>
   Avowed

  over the next few months.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is full of tools for players to use in their fight for galactic freedom and managed democracy. After numerous hours of repeated missions and experimentations, some have crafted the best personal builds to help them fulfill Super Earth's cause. Although players have many different equipment options, some can be considered so powerful that they would be more of a hindrance than a benefit. A particular stratagem in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is well-known for being one, but the game's upcoming major update may just change its perceived value among the community.

  The Escalation of Freedom update coming to

  on the 6th of August 2024 will bring some interesting content. One of the more notable additions would be a new level 10 difficulty that's said to include massive factories and outposts. As amazing as it sounds, the challenge will likely be very tough to complete as it will have more enemies and bigger structural defenses to tackle. But it is because of that the

  Normally, the Orbital 380mm Barrage is a stratagem players avoid in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Although very powerful and covers a large area when used, the randomness of where the explosions end up usually causes more harm than good. In many cases, it causes the deaths of fellow allies rather than enemies even when properly used, making it more of a liability than an asset. However, the upcoming large factories and outposts could be the best targets to use the stratagem on, and here are a few reasons why:

 <ul>
  <li>
   The destructive power and wide area of explosions could get rid of many or even all the dangerous obstacles within the massive enemy settlement
  </li>
  <li>
   The stratagem can be used as a powerful last resort if players are unable to get through the factories or outposts with conventional strategies
  </li>
  <li>
   The long duration of the barrage can allow players to set up everything they need while also dealing massive damage to the humongous target
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Some consider the Orbital 380mm Barrage as an underrated but fun stratagem in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , and the Escalation of Freedom update has the chance to make it more than that. While there's no telling if it will make tackling the upcoming factories and outposts much easier, its destructive benefits will likely encourage players to use it.

  Why the Destructive Orbital Stratagem Should Be Used More
 </h3>
 <p>
  Some believe that the Orbital 380mm Barrage shouldn't be used because of its drawbacks, but it is for that reason that it makes a unique and interesting stratagem. Besides being a weapon known for eliminating enemies and allies, it can also create gameplay experiences that no other stratagem can provide. While its destructive power could ruin the chances of completing a mission, it can also do the opposite while adding an extra benefit.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1059} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  When using it for its intended purpose of removing large spawns of enemies or heavy outposts, it has the potential to create fun and exciting gameplay.The chaos it brings could make combat situations easier or harder to deal with, but its randomness can at least be counted on to produce entertaining results. Although far from being ranked as one of the best stratagems in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , it is still a powerful tool whose entertaining benefits can outweigh its disadvantages.

 <p>
  The Escalation of Freedom update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  could elevate the status of the Orbital 380mm Barrage stratagem with its new difficulty and larger enemy settlements. While some will remain hesitant to use the destructive weapon, the upcoming major patch can at least make it be seen as a viable option despite its disadvantages.

  <em>
   Roots of Pacha
  </em>
  is a co-op farming and life simulation game that has drawn comparisons to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . The big twist is that the game is set in the Stone Stage, which lends itself to unique scenarios, characters, and items not typically found in farming/life sim games.
  <em>
   Roots of Pacha
  </em>
  was previously available on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch, but has now made the jump to Xbox with its big 1.2 update.

      Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million copies thus far, with the recent Shadow of the Erdtree DLC increasing interest in the title.

     <li>
      This is up 3.6 million from the previous update in June, with the latest data being recorded in September - meaning the game and its expansion could have sold even more in the final months of 2024.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer FromSoftware has shed light on the latest sales figures of the action RPG, which sit at more than 28 million copies sold. Since releasing in 2022,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has already received a highly rated DLC,
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , with another game set in its universe coming in the near future.

 <p>
  In its launch year,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , which chronicles the Tarnished's adventures across the mystical world of the Lands Between, generated significant revenue and claimed several major accolades—including winning multiple Game of the Year recognitions. In June 2024, its highly anticipated
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion came out to widespread acclaim and further boosted the sales of the base game, re-energizing player interest in the fantasy title. More recently, at The Game Awards 2024, FromSoftware unveiled yet another
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  universe game—a spin-off titled
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  —giving fans more to be excited about. Around the same time, the Japanese studio also provided updated sales of the original game, offering a look into its continued popularity.

 <p>
  On December 13, FromSoftware revealed that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's latest sales numbers reached 28.6 million units sold, as of September 2024. This follows the
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  developer's announcement in mid-June, which said that the 2022 game had sold 25 million copies till then. In other words, this means that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  moved 3.6 million more copies in a period of around three months, on the back of
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's strong showing. In fact, the scintillating success of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's DLC also saw it get multiple nominations at The Game Awards 2024, including in the Game of the Year category that had previously been off-limits for non-standalone titles.

 <p>
  The refreshed sales figures give a glimpse into the sustained interest in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , even over two years after launch. Fortunately, for FromSoftware, this positive trend looks set to grow further as fans inch closer to the release of
  <em>
   Elden Ring : Nightreign
  </em>
  , which is the first
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  project to not be helmed by studio head Hidetaka Miyazaki. The reins of the spin-off game—scheduled for a 2025 release—are in director Junya Ishizaki's hands instead, which suggests fans may see a new approach for the IP.

 <p>
  Notably,
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  's key point of difference from previous
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  titles has already been revealed to be its survival co-op nature. Ishizaki has also previously spoken about how
  <em>
   Nightreign
  </em>
  won't be similar to live-service games like
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  , despite being an online multiplayer title. While the anticipation for the game has started building since the big reveal, whether the new spin on
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's world receives similar success as previous FromSoftware titles is anyone's guess right now.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is firmly established as gaming's definitive subscription service, a reputation built upon years of goodwill. Each month, Microsoft adds a few games to the service, ensuring subscribers always have something new to check out. While slightly overshadowed by its console counterpart,
  <strong>
   PC Game Pass

  is a great option for people who prefer to play on a computer rather than an Xbox.

  Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass offer many of the same games, which reflects Microsoft's desire to cater to its whole customer base rather than just those who own consoles. That said, there are differences between the two, including some great titles that are only on the PC iteration. What are the

 <p>
  Arguably the last truly "big" release of 2024,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  had a strange road towards completion. Despite MachineGames' resume mostly speaking for itself and an AAA-budget
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  game sounding fantastic,
  <em>
   The Great Circle
  </em>
  attracted a somewhat muted response at first, primarily due to it using a first-person angle rather than third-person. Honestly, after decades of
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , the desire for a third-person Indy made sense; conversely, MachineGames specializes in FPS projects, so the developer's decision to stick to first-person was also understandable.

 <p>
  Ultimately, that discussion was rendered moot once
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  landed on Game Pass and put any doubts to rest. Comfortably the best video game representation of Dr. Jones, the 2024 release is a visual tour de force that also delivers franchise-suitable story and gameplay. The latter is particularly important, as Indy is not known for gunning down hundreds of enemies during his adventure; consequently, a
  <em>
   Wolfenstein
  </em>
  -style shooter would have been unusual. Fortunately, MachineGames minimized gunplay in favor of stealth, puzzles, exploration, and occasional platforming.
  <em>
   The Great Circle
  </em>
  gives the iconic protagonist a whip and a gun, but the former is his preferred weapon while the latter is for desperate situations.

  Considering everything GSC has been through in recent years, the fact that
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  exists at all is a big deal. That said, the game did not enjoy the smoothest launch, garnering quite a bit of criticism due to bugs and performance issues. Now, to be fair, GSC released a few early patches that improved things, so it is in a mostly playable state. Still, anyone who picks this up should be prepared for what might not be a flawless experience.

 <p>
  Beyond that,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  evolves the franchise's core concepts well, offering an incredibly massive open-world that is visually, thematically, and atmospherically dense. While incorporating horror elements and first-person gunplay,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  is ultimately about survival, which extends beyond the player's basic needs and into The Zone's political and social standings. Mutants are not the only danger in this region.

  With Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard,
  <em>
   Spyro the Dragon
  </em>
  is technically an Xbox mascot nowadays. Even though the franchise has not done much in the last few years, there is always a chance that a new game will be announced, one that could very well debut on Game Pass or even be an Xbox exclusive. Whether that day comes to pass remains to be seen, but in the meantime, subscribers can check out the

  While delivering a significant upgrade in visuals, Toys for Bob mostly opted to recapture the magic of the classic trilogy, delivering three campaigns that very much feel like they are ripped from the memories of people who grew up with
  <em>
   Spyro the Dragon
  </em>
  . All three titles are great, and they build upon each other in ways that make the trilogy feel like a cohesive progression.

  <em>
   Metal Slug
  </em>
  is an arcade staple that is responsible for some of the greatest run-and-gun games of all time. As brilliant as classics like
  <em>
   Metal Slug 3
  </em>
  are, the series has struggled to remain relevant in recent decades, and a return to the traditional formula is starting to seem unlikely at this point.

  That said,
  <em>
   Metal Slug Tactics
  </em>
  is a pretty cool alternative. As suggested by its title, the spin-off is an isometric tactics game that challenges players to run through a few missions with their chosen team. Before they get going, they get to pick three characters from a more expansive roster, all of whom come with unique abilities that encourage trying different parties to see which one works out the best.
  <em>
   Metal Slug Tactics
  </em>
  is essentially a roguelike, with failure sending players back to the start; surprisingly, this decision gives the game an arcade feel that complements the license.

  When Activision fell under the Microsoft umbrella, it was only a matter of time before
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  would make its Game Pass arrival.
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  was the first project to debut, and while a big deal in its own right, the real question was whether a new entry would launch directly on the service. Well, that moment came with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , Treyarch and Raven Software's 2024 effort. Obviously, every
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game seems to be a commercial success, but the franchise's reputation has taken a hit in recent years thanks to
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  launching with quite a few issues like an underwhelming single-player story.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  had to be a notable step up, especially since it was going to reach lapsed or even new players due to its Game Pass availability.

  While not flawless, this sequel is a pretty great return to form, one that offers both high-quality solo and multiplayer content. If someone has no interest in PvP, they can just focus on the single-player campaign, which is a fast-paced blockbuster-style action fest that represents
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  at its best. Although not extremely long, it is fun and plays great. That said, the multiplayer side of things is
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's main selling point, as is always the case with modern entries in the series. Along with a diverse lineup of 6v6 modes, the game also has Zombies, which should keep co-op fans entertained for quite a while. Unlike
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  's open-zone structure,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  mostly utilizes
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's formula, so it does play like a more traditional take on the mode.

  Despite being slightly overshadowed by its predecessor,
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  is nevertheless a fantastic RPG adaptation of the iconic and irreverent animated series. Once again, the new kid finds himself in the middle of an all-out war between South Park's resident children, with Cartman naturally adding constant fuel to the fire. Unlike the first game's fantasy tropes, the sequel focuses on superheroes, taking potshots at comics and, more emphatically, the movie craze that was running rampant in the mid-2010s (and still is, to an extent).

 <p>
  The story and humor are quintessential
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  , in the sense that they mostly repeat ideas that have originally been mined by the show and
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  . However, that does not mean
  <em>
   The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  has no narrative value, as it still manages to get a few comforting laughs while taking some comedic risks that threaten to be poignant. Crucially, the game is just fun to play, largely thanks to a revamped combat system that presents players with a bit more control and choice during battles. The campaign is still pretty easy, but fights do require thought to maneuver and surpass.

  is still one of the best strategy city-builders on PC Game Pass, and it is now joined by a successor. Excitingly,

  introduces so many new ideas and expands the scale so significantly that it feels notably different from its predecessor; consequently, the sequel has not rendered the first game obsolete.

  Set a few decades after the first game,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  puts players in charge of New London, a city that is trying to balance progression and survival. As always, leaders will need to find a way to drive the city's growth while meeting the basic needs of its citizens, which is no easy task when there is the ever-present threat of a shutdown due to unpredictable snowstorms. Although very much a survival game,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is first and foremost a city-builder, and players will spend a great deal of time setting up connections and tiles. Beyond that, the sequel focuses quite a lot on politics, very much emphasizing that players are (essentially) running a government that has to take into account various factions with contradictory wants.

  has an inspired death mechanic. Players step into the shoes of a martial artist who goes on a revenge tour that involves taking on five fighters, each of whom comes with their own stage. Now, whenever the protagonist fails, they revive as an older version of themselves, allowing them to keep going with stronger attacks but less HP. Eventually, they die permanently and have to start from scratch.

 <p>
  This concept is brilliant, and it allows some more room for failure than the typical roguelike. However, do not mistake this mechanic as a sign that Sloclap decided to take things easy on players. No,

  <em>
   Legend of Mana

  and
  <em>
   Trials of Mana

  are both on PC Game Pass, and they are solid action JRPGs. That said, the latter is a more ambitious remake than the former, resulting in a modern experience that is more likely to hit the mark with new players who just want a fun battle-driven adventure.

  <em>
   Trials of Mana
  </em>
  features six characters, each of whom represents a different class and background; more importantly, players get to pick three fighters for a playthrough, enhancing the game's overall replayability. While initially coming across as somewhat simple, the hack and slash combat steadily improves as players unlock more skills and upgrade their characters. The campaign also opens up about halfway through, granting a bit more freedom in how players progress.

  While also available on the Xbox Series consoles,
  <em>
   Age of Mythology: Retold
  </em>
  just feels at home on PC. An updated version of the 2002 cult classic, the RTS game takes the
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  formula and engulfs it in mysticism, creating an experience that sticks fairly true to the mainline entry's loop while still very much being unique.
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  is mostly pitched as a "remaster," but that would be underselling the changes since they extend beyond improved graphics. World's Edge and Forgotten Empires implemented a range of quality-of-life adjustments to cater to a modern audience, all the while trying to respectfully retain the original game's rhythm and tone. The endeavor was mostly successful, resulting in a project that should hit the mark with both young and veteran RTS fans.

 <p>
  As with nearly any great RTS game,
  <em>
   AoM: Retold
  </em>
  primarily boils down to effective planning and resource management. Each available myth has well-defined strengths and weaknesses, along with unique traits and god abilities that need to be properly analyzed and mastered. In terms of single-player content, there are campaigns containing unique missions that can keep people engaged for a while.
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  also supported co-op and PvP, with the latter likely determining the project's longevity.

  At this point, recommending the original
  <em>
   Doom

  games seems pointless. If someone has not played id Software's seminal shooters yet, they are unlikely to get to them because of the latest re-release. Still, that does not take anything away from their sheer quality, as there is a reason
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  and its sequel continue to be revisited all these years later. They are masterpieces that set the standard for an entire genre, and their influence can still be seen in the countless retro boomer shooters that are released every single year.

  2024 has not been stacked with Xbox console exclusives so far, but Ninja Theory's
  <em>
   Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
  </em>
  stands as a proud and powerful exception. Similar to its predecessor, the fantastic
  <em>
   Senua's Sacrifice
  </em>
  , the sequel is very much a unique beast that focuses on telling a character-driven story, with combat and puzzles taking a backseat throughout most of the campaign. That's not to say players will be just watching a glorified movie play out, as they will find themselves engaging in some fairly intense battles throughout Senua's journey. However, the combat exists entirely in service of the narrative and is only marginally better than the first game.

  <em>
   Hellblade 2
  </em>
  should be entered as blindly as possible, especially since most people will probably only stick around for a single playthrough (that will be relatively short). While avoiding specific spoilers, it can be revealed that the sequel focuses more on Senua's connections with the living rather than the dead. Also, the game is genuinely gorgeous, perhaps to the point of being the best-looking title on the Xbox Series X.

  The entirety of the
  <em>

  franchise took a lengthy hiatus from PC after its initial outing with
  <em>
   Combat Evolved
  </em>
  , but all of that finally changed in 2019 — when the

  The
  <em>
   MCC
  </em>
  is virtually a crown jewel on the Xbox side of Game Pass, and it loses very little of that status in its transition to PC.20greatest achievements of the 2010s. So, does this make it a must-play for anyone with a PC Game Pass subscription? Well, yes and no. If someone loves 2D platformers, they owe it to themselves to try Extremely OK Games' title. However,
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  is a hard-as-nails precision platformer that can be exhausting for anyone who is not really looking for an especially difficult challenge. It is not particularly accessible.

  Unlike quite a few entries in the genre,
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  has a pretty in-depth story. Players control Madeline, a woman who goes on a soul-searching journey to climb Celeste Mountain. Touching upon mature themes like depression, the platformer is surprisingly character-driven, and its punishing gameplay reflects Madeline's journey.

  Angel Matrix's
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  took the world by storm in 2022, and the innovative platformer is a fantastic addition to PC Game Pass. Now, this is one of those projects that generally must be played to be properly understood, and it is entirely made by its controls, gameplay feel, and seamless blend of mechanics. Still, the core concept revolves around managing multipurpose cards to pick the best action in a given situation, all in the hopes of clearing out stages and reaching their endpoints.

  While the story is kind of weird,
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  nails pretty much everything else. The visual style is slick and eye-catching, while the gameplay is fast-paced, satisfying, and strategic. The level design is consistently strong and caters to repeat attempts, particularly for players interested in speedrunning.

  should consider hopping into
  <em>

  . This microscopic adventure sees players entering a backyard landscape after being shrunk down to a fraction of their former size. Players will have to battle against hordes of vicious bugs to collect various materials to strengthen their armaments and increase their survivability.

 <p>
  Along the way, they will uncover an underlying storyline that will have them traveling all over the backyard to collect a variety of specialized computer chips. Players can embark on this journey by themselves or join in with up to three other friends, both of which should result in mostly enjoyable survival sandbox experiences. That said,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  really comes alive in co-op, especially since players take on four different characters who can pursue unique and complementary builds.

  <em>

  <em>

  After spending almost a year in early access on Steam,
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  made its full debut on October 20, 2022. The top-down roguelike has been nothing short of a colossal hit, and it has received plenty of updates over the last year. After selecting one of
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  ' available characters, players drop into a stage where they are bombarded by waves of enemies. The goal is to simply survive until the time limit while upgrading weapons, unlocking power-ups, and gaining gold coins.

 <p>
  Although initially seeming very simple, this indie darling has surprising depth thanks to its wide variety of characters and weapons, all of which require a lot of effort to fully master. Even unlocking everything is hard work.
  <em>

  is a great

  <em>
   SteamWorld
  </em>
  is an odd duck that refuses to stick to a single genre, with most games seemingly exploring new avenues that are only loosely connected to their predecessors and successors. Despite this suggesting inconsistency, to its credit, the franchise has rarely set a foot wrong, with basically every game having something to offer and being worthwhile additions to their genre.
  <em>
   SteamWorld Dig 2
  </em>
  was something of an exception as it was the IP's first sequel, and it specifically sought to fine-tune the 2013 project to craft an experience that is strictly an evolution rather than a complete renovation.

 <p>
  SteamWorld Dig 2 is fantastic and close to the franchise's pinnacle, although opinions will depend on the player's preferred style of game. The sequel is an explorative Metroidvania that casts players as a digger who must traverse a labyrinth under a Western town in search of resources they can then sell off. Naturally, they will have to fight a lot of enemies along the way, all the while unlocking an ever-expanding arsenal of gadgets and abilities.

  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  took the most popular sci-fi franchise of all time and gave it a Soulslike makeover. While not perfect (a tolerance for backtracking is required), the marriage was generally fruitful, and the game balanced story progression, combat, and puzzles fairly well. Unsurprisingly, in 2023, a sequel found its way to current-gen systems and PC, and it was arguably an improvement over its predecessor in nearly every area. However,
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  's launch was muddied by performance issues, specifically on PC. Although not usually unplayable (although a person's mileage may vary),
  <em>
   Survivor
  </em>
  suffered from framerate drops and stuttering, even on high-end systems. Post-game patches improved a few things but hardly everything; consequently, even now, players should be prepared for the occasional glitch.

 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  is on PC Game Pass, people who were put off by the negative press can finally give it a try without worrying too much about wasting their money. Bugs and glitches aside, this title has a lot of things going for it. The story builds very nicely on Cal Kestis' journey in
  <em>
   Fallen Order
  </em>
  , expanding not only his moveset but also his character in the process. The campaign features an impressive array of worlds, including returning favorites and new planets, and they are brought to life beautifully. Fine-tuned and improved with a few new options, the combat and traversal mechanics are slightly improved as well, although they are still quite similar to the first game.

  Mostly developed by one creator and currently in Game Preview,
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  is a medieval sim that blends a few genres: survival, city-builder, and tactics. While the latter appears in the form of occasional battles with neighboring towns or bandits, the former elements take center stage during most playthroughs, and they are handled with care and creativity. As suggested by the title,
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  is all about setting up a settlement during the Middle Ages, a journey that starts small but ambitious and gradually snowballs into expansive and ambitious.

 <p>
  City-builders tend to cast players as deities towering over their creations, setting them apart from the worlds they rule.
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  shakes this formula up by placing players in the dirt alongside their citizens, all of whom are treated as people with personalities rather than just numbers. Surviving is a group effort that requires everyone to pitch in, and
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  allows players to make the necessary choices to facilitate this mentality and then witness the fruit of their labor. While still a work in progress, this title is already among the most exciting
  <strong>
   PC Game Pass games
  </strong>
  .

  Some players may not realize the importance of this building until they have already begun to raise animals, resulting in a scramble to get one built quickly. To help new farmers, here's a quick guide on how to build silos and use them on the farm.

  Now that the 1.6 update has arrived on all platforms, more farmers than ever are flocking to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  to live out their dreams of a simple country life. In addition to exciting new items and events, the game's latest version also adds plenty of balance changes and quality-of-life modifications. One of these relates to how grass grows on the farm during Winter, which affects how players feed their animals and store their Hay in silos. For those who are exploring 1.6, here's what farmers need to know.

  The silo is a good choice as a first building to purchase. It is cheaper and requires fewer materials than most other buildings; furthermore, it allows players to
  <strong>
   stockpile a feed supply,
  </strong>
  which will help keep their animals happy and producing quality goods. To build a silo on their farm, players will need to collect the following materials:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    100 Stone:
   </strong>
   This is one of the easiest materials to collect. Simply break rocks with a pickaxe on the farm or in the mines.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    10 Clay:
   </strong>
   Dig in the dirt with the hoe. Players can typically find enough Clay when preparing land to plant seeds. Additionally, look for artifact spots (little worms sticking out of the dirt). These may yield Clay as well.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    5 Copper Bar:
   </strong>
   Break copper ore nodes with the pickaxe in the mines. These are common in the upper levels, so players should be able to quickly collect a supply even in the early game. Place five copper ore and one coal in a furnace to make one copper bar.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Take these materials to Robin at the carpentry shop to purchase a silo for
  <strong>
   100g,
  </strong>
  which will take two days to complete. Generally, the best locations for silos are at the far edges or corners of the farm, where they won't get in the player's way. However, depending on the player's choice of layout, they may decide to incorporate them decoratively into their farm's design.

  Note that if the player purchases a

  these will come with an

This also means that players can no longer manually remove hay from the silos to store it elsewhere. If the player has auto feeders and several animals on their farm, it's often helpful to have multiple silos, so that they don't run short on hay every few days.

  As mentioned above, the Silo is a great choice for a first building on a new farm. Many first-time players, eager to start raising animals, may be tempted to buy a Barn or Coop first; however, it is a mistake to do so without a Silo on the farm. The lack of a Silo makes it very difficult to keep animals fed, unless the player has lots of grass growing outside.

 <p>
  Speaking of grass, players will likely be cutting a lot of grass in the early game as they clear the overgrown land for planting and building.
  <strong>
   If the player does not have a Silo on their farm as they do so, it's a waste of sources for hay.
  </strong>
  With this in mind, players should make an effort to build a Silo — or even two — as one of their first priorities.

 <p>
  Storing Hay in the silo(s) is particularly important when
  <strong>
   preparing for winter.
  </strong>
  During this season, animals won't graze outside, preferring the cozy warmth of the barn or coop. As such, storing hay in the silo is essential. Any grass left standing at the end of Fall will remain on the player's farm throughout Winter; however, it goes dormant. This means that if it is cut, it will not grow back until the start of Spring. Additionally, grass provides less Hay when cut during the winter. Make sure that the silos are fully stocked with hay before the seasons change, as keeping them full will be a challenge during the snowy season.

  <strong>
   Unreal Engine
  </strong>
  is one of the premier gaming engines that has powered some of the best games for well over two decades. It was initially made for the FPS game
  <em>
   Unreal
  </em>
  , but as other developers saw its potential, it was swiftly sourced out.

 <p>
  There are now five generations of Unreal Engine, with each making vast improvements in tandem with technological advances in the industry. The engine has always been known for visuals that are ahead of the field, whilst boasting additional features such as the Visual Scripting method which allows creatives without coding experience to make games. The best games of each Unreal Engine generation are naturally tough to narrow down with so many great candidates, but thankfully, a few truly stand out, especially the ones that won Game of The Year.

  There were only a handful of titles released on the original Unreal Engine, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    Deus Ex
   </strong>
  </em>
  stands out from the rest for a number of reasons and is considered to be one of the greatest games of all time. In fact, the game was so successful and loved, that it would go on to become the first in a franchise of
  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  games.

  Set in the year 2052, this cyberpunk FPS depicts a realistic future world where greed and violence are rife. There are no monsters or aliens, meaning the decision to shoot and kill weighs more heavily on the mind, and everything bad within the in-game world is based on real conspiracy theories. What keeps players coming back even years later are the story elements and open-ended choices that modern RPGs have only just begun to return to.

  <em>
   <strong>
    BioShock
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the original installment in a series that needs no introductions. Its unique and vibrant art style helps it stand out from an abundance of other shooter games, but it also has the weapons and mechanics to match.

 <p>
  It is a game that promises to provide players with weapons and tactics they have never seen before, and pits them against bizarre enemies who have a certain uncanny horror to them. It is also known for its incredible voice-acting, story, and atmosphere. All of this helped the original
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  win Game of The Year in 2007, making it easily one of the best products of Unreal Engine 2.

  Many
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  games were released on Unreal Engine 3, but the one that arguably pushed the engine furthest was
  <em>
   <strong>
    Batman: Arkham Knight
   </strong>
  </em>
  . This epic conclusion to the award-winning trilogy is more polished than previous iterations and easily looks the best. The open world of Arkham is a character of its own and is best traversed in the batmobile, which can be summoned at any moment.

 <p>
  As always with the series, the action is engaging and yet retains some of the feel of a comic book. The story is one of the best, especially thanks to popular characters such as the Joker.

  With Unreal Engine 5 only releasing in the past few years, Unreal Engine 4 arguably has the best selection of games dating back to 2014. It is incredibly tough to narrow down so many great titles, especially with games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  making such a huge splash in the gaming world. In terms of undeniable quality and love from all who played it, however, there is one special product of UE4 that won Game of The Year in 2021.

  <em>
   <strong>
    It Takes Two
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a co-op platformer and puzzle game, where players take on the roles of two parents going through a tough part of their marriage. However, when they get shrunken down into their daughter's toys, they must work together to escape, and in doing so, they rekindle their love for one another. Every single mission sees Cody and May gain new abilities, all of which are hilarious to use, and players will constantly find themselves pleasantly surprised. The story is punctuated by moments of sadness and humor alike, with incredibly diverse and alive backdrops that stand out in one's memory years after playing.
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  also has a unique selling point in that it literally takes two players to work together. It cannot be played alone, but thankfully only one player needs to own the game.

  Unreal Engine 5 is arguably the future of gaming, with many mind-blowing features to boast of. For example, the Lumen and Nanite systems allow for incredibly detailed scenes with real-time lighting, whilst still performing well. Released in 2022, the new wave of this next generation of games has only just begun, and there are many upcoming Unreal Engine 5 titles to be excited about, such as
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In terms of current Unreal Engine 5 games which have already showcased the full might of the engine,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </strong>
  </em>
  certainly stands out. This unanimous masterpiece delivers across the board in an RPG inspired by Chinese mythology and folklore. Every aspect of the visuals is breathtaking, from the environments and characters to the animations and visual effects. The game is truly brought alive, however, by its fluid action and boss fights, with combat which feels unique when compared with other open-world RPGs.

  Skills are essential for Sim's hobbies, jobs, goals, and certain storytelling elements. While Skills can be increased through gameplay in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , players can also use cheats and mods to speed up the process. This guide has all the Skill cheats available in every
  <em>

 <p>
  Increasing Skills is an important aspect of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  for many reasons. Sims with high skills sometimes get unique social interactions and have more options for higher-paying jobs. Alternatively, some Skills are related to crafting, so they can make valuable paintings, songs, and books to sell.

 <p>
  Learning Skills takes time and practice if Sims want to max them out. While certain emotions, lot traits, or potions can boost their Skill progression, it can still take several days of nonstop work to increase Skills. Luckily, players have a complete set of cheats dedicated to setting their Skill level.

 <p>
  Skills are put into a few categories: Major, Minor, Child, and Toddler. Major and Minor Skills can be learned by Teens, Young Adults, Adults, and Elders. Once Children max out their Child Skills, they gain access to certain Major and Minor ones.

 <p>
  Major Skills have ten levels, and Minor and Toddler Skills have five, except for the Potty Skill, which maxes out at level 3. Doing activities and using objects related to the Skills will build them up, but players don't have to grind it out if they don't want to with cheats. Here is a video demonstrating how to enable and use major, horse, child, and toddler skill cheats in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>

  Most of the Skill cheat codes follow a formula of
  <strong>
   stats.set_skill_level (Skill Type)_(Skill Name) X,
  </strong>
  with X being the desired level, but there are some variations. See below for a complete list of all the Skill cheat codes in

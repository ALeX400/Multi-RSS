   <em>

   <em>
    Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  features time travel and the powerful Paradox Pokemon from the past and future. Unlike many prior
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, players encounter and befriend the Legendary Pokemon early on. This allows players to start forming a bond with the Legendaries quickly.

 <p>
  Most interestingly, the Legendaries can be ridden, making it a breeze to explore Paldea. Gen 10 should not take a step back and return to previous forms of transport, many of which require the use of HMs. Instead, it should take notes from
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Violet
  </em>
  and have Pokemon that can transport players anywhere.

  In
  <em>
   Scarlet
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Violet
  </em>
  , players can ride the Legendary Pokemon Koraidon and Miraidon. The Pokemon are extremely versatile and can ride over water and glide down from heights. At first, the Legendaries can’t do much but as they eat Herba Mystica sandwiches, they gain more abilities. The Pokemon aren’t just for traversing, however, and Koraidon and Miraidon can be used in battle.

 <p>
  Having players ride the Legendary Pokemon was a good move by Game Freak. It gives players the chance to spend time with the Legendary Pokemon, which allows players to bond with them. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for HMs which can be annoying to use, and it eliminates the need for an ‘HM slave,’ which is a relatively weak Pokemon that most HMs are slapped onto. Such a Pokemon is used for getting past obstacles instead of battling.

 <p>
  The old mounts and transport methods from past games were fun, but they did come with downsides. They couldn’t glide or climb up mountains, which is something Koraidon and Miraidon can do when they’ve fully powered up. Additionally, the old traversal methods required HMs to get past trees and dark caves. This requires wasting a Pokemon’s move slot on an HM that isn’t particularly viable in battle.

  <em>

  introduce an interesting way to get around while switching up the formula of how Legendaries are encountered. The next generation should also feature Legendaries that serve as mounts, but it needs to be done uniquely. Returning to old means of transport would feel too stale. The next

 <p>
  With the full launch of
  <em>
   <strong>
    MultiVersus

  variation.

  As of the writing of this guide, Jason Voorhees can only be unlocked with
  <strong>
   Season 1's premium battle pass
  </strong>
  . The Premium Battle Pass costs 950 Gleamium; thus, gamers must purchase this character with real money. However, Jason Voorhees is available as a Tier 1 battle pass prize; therefore, there is not much effort necessary to get this character.

 <p>
  Players who participated in
  <em>
   MultiVersus'
  </em>
  Open Beta will be able to obtain the characters for free as a prize, as the premium components of the Season 1 Battle Pass are free for them due to their beta testing involvement.

 <p>
  However, gamers who did not participate in the open beta or purchased the Premium Battle Pass will have to wait until Season 2 to access this character. Jason Voorhees is likely to become available in the in-game market with the Season 2 update since every character will ultimately be able to be unlocked with fighter currency.

      <title>V Rising PS5 Review</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    V Rising
   </em>
  </strong>
  began its journey back in 2022 as an early access game exclusive to PC. Even then, it quickly grew to prominence among survival game enthusiasts, who praised the game for its deep customization, engaging combat, and unique, vampiric premise. Now that
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  has come to PS5, console players can dive into the game's strengths and weaknesses for themselves.

 <p>
  There aren't many survival games built around a vampire player-character, but
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  aims to be the definitive title in that niche. It takes place in Vardoran, a land ravaged by an ancient vampire civil war and reeling from the tyranny of Dracula himself, a power-hungry vampire craving total submission from both vampires and humans. Players assume the role of a custom vampire, awakened from a deep slumber and ready to pursue their destiny as an independent champion of their own domain.

 <p>
  But
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  is rather sparse when it comes to plot. The closest thing to a main campaign is the player's pursuit and defeat of V Bloods, distinct bosses scattered throughout Vardoran. These V Bloods, highly varied and well-designed, sit at the heart of
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's gameplay loop—and it's quite a satisfying loop indeed.

  At first glance,
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  doesn't seem too removed from familiar survival gameplay systems: players farm materials for use as construction components, both for their gear and for their home base. But
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  makes a few clever, thematically appropriate departures from its contemporaries.

 <p>
  For one thing, the castle-building system, on top of being intuitive, offers concrete gameplay advantages in addition to the expected sense of self-expression. Since players will take damage from sun exposure, there is a mechanical benefit to building a complete structure, as roofs provide shelter from the sun's rays. Vaulted ceilings will automatically appear once players have enclosed a room with castle walls, making the construction process feel even more natural. With these systems, it's remarkably easy to craft aesthetically pleasing, practical bases in the game.

     One particularly interesting mechanic is the blood purity/type system, which gives players different buffs based on which NPC they drain of blood. This makes blood-sucking an engaging, useful tool, rather than a chore designed to top-off an obligatory resource.

 <p>
  There's a pervasive sense of synergy in
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's crafting mechanics. Players will quickly gain access to different options for refining materials, allowing for the creation of more powerful gear, which in turn makes both combat and resource-farming more efficient and fruitful. As one's castle grows in both size and utility, it's hard not to personalize thanks to the surprisingly vast collection of craftable cosmetics, which is constantly being expanded with the defeat of new V Bloods and the discovery of randomized blueprint drops in the game world. Fighting V Bloods and seeking out building materials is all the more satisfying thanks to the game's combat, which hits far above the survival genre weight class.

  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's combat is similar to other action-RPGs like
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , but with enough differences that keep it from feeling derivative. Players gain access to basic weapons like swords, axes, and spears early on, but the combat sandbox slowly opens up with the arrival of armaments like crossbows, pistols, and whips. There's also a laundry list of different spells and special abilities across six distinct magic categories:

 <p>
  With the vast majority of V Blood bosses rewarding skill points in these categories, players will quickly amass a wide assortment of unique abilities, including variations on staple moves like dashing and countering. Though the game has a lot in common with action-RPGs, it has virtually nothing resembling strict builds or rigid stat assignments, making it painless and rewarding to experiment with different ability combinations. This flexibility and the rapid pace of new spell unlocks keep
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's combat from ever getting dull or repetitive.

  New spells arrive at a steady cadence, but the same can't be said for gear, which forms the brunt of
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's linear power creep.
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  determines power by an overall gear score, meaning that no matter how many enemies a player defeats, they won't grow stronger without higher-level weapons and armor. It can take a while to unlock more powerful gear, and then this gear must be crafted with resources that are increasingly difficult to obtain. Defeating V Blood enemies is the most effective way to get new gear, especially early on, but it's not easy to overcome a V Blood when you're underleveled, which can result in a feeling of painfully slow progression, especially when playing solo.

  <em>

  's steady grind is aided by its exciting combat and exploration, but its pacing issues may intimidate or bore newcomers to the survival RPG genre. Likewise, if a player has a particularly low tolerance for grind-heavy gameplay,
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's progression has the potential to lead to some dull moments. Progression can speed up a bit once players unlock the Study, which facilitates faster research of item blueprints, but the game can still hit some slow patches occasionally, especially during the mid-game, as RNG becomes a more important factor in blueprint acquisition.

  <em>

  's transition to PlayStation is about as smooth as one could ask for. The port runs well, and I experienced only the most negligible framerate stutters and graphical glitches during my playthrough. Online performance was strong for me as well, with no major hiccups on even the most packed servers. Overall, the game looks and performs about as strongly on PS5 as it would on a PC running at max settings.

 <p>
  It isn't without its hiccups, though, the most significant being controller support. The game was built for a keyboard-and-mouse setup, and while the DualSense is serviceable, it can feel a bit clumsy at times. Aiming spells and projectiles with the right stick can be finicky and unreliable, especially without any aim assist or a lock-on feature. Similarly, the button-mapping for special weapon attacks is a little awkward compared to the regular key-bindings on PC, and it's easy to select the wrong option from the radial menu, especially in the heat of combat - something that can be particularly frustrating since the healing ability is accessed through said menu.

 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's base building doesn't feel nearly as good with a controller, as placing objects with the analog stick is sometimes cumbersome and imprecise. Inventory management with a controller is also a bit slow, but not egregiously so. In general, controller support just doesn't feel like a top priority.

  While the above issues are notable, they are by no means dealbreakers. After a few hours, most players will learn the ropes of
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  's combat, and the DualSense controls won't feel like much of a hindrance. Still, some button remapping options or a lock-on system might have made controller gameplay feel a bit more natural.

  Minor issues of pacing and controls aside,

      <title>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Cutest Side Quest Can't Be a One-Off</title>

  Well-designed side quests are often hard to come by; developers sometimes want to add more content to a game without distracting players from the main story too much, but this usually means side quests have unfulfilling objectives. For the most part, side quests such as these amount to little more than "fetch and kill" quests, which, as their moniker suggests, see players either fetching an item for the quest-giver or killing an enemy.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the latest games to include plenty of side quests for players to complete, and many of them happen to fall on the better side of quest design. In fact, it's possible for players to miss out on some decent character development and worldbuilding should they skip some of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  's side quests.

  While many of the side quests offered in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  are more than worth doing, there is one, in particular, that is highly distinct from the others. "When Words Won't Do" is an optional quest that players can pick up once they arrive in Under Junon, and it just so happens to be what is arguably

  's cutest side quest. Its value goes far beyond its cute factor, however, as its design, execution, and even its music all make for a unique experience in the game that other side quests don't provide. As such, perhaps Part 3 of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  trilogy should consider bringing this quest (and its main character) back for an encore.

  's side quests aren't necessarily all the same, but almost none of them stand out like "When Words Won't Do." Not long after they arrive in Under Junon, players can speak to the Under Junon Sheriff, Rhonda, to receive the quest. She then proceeds to task players with escorting Salmon the porter dog as he delivers money to her estranged son. She hasn't seen him since he left town without looking back, and she now wants to send him some Gil as a way of letting him be a “grown man” and live his own life.

 <p>
  Once players meet up with Salmon, a fun electronic music track begins playing to show the quest's main journey has begun. Most of this part of the quest involves nothing more than following Salmon as he braves the wilds of Junon with his newfound friends behind him, but players are also required to overcome multiple enemy encounters along the way. Interestingly, the battle music during this quest has also been exchanged for something electronic that is more akin to the main theme that plays while following Salmon. All of this doesn't necessarily make for an exciting set of objectives, but its uniqueness comes from its adorable animal companion and the upbeat music that plays throughout the quest.

 <p>
  It would be a shame to let such a cute side quest be a one-off after
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , especially after introducing players to Salmon and even giving him his own theme song. As such,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  's sequel should see Salmon return for another quest or two. It might be too much to ask to make Salmon a permanent companion, but Part 3 of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  trilogy could still amp up any potential quests associated with him. In any case, it would be nice to see him again in the next game. If not Salmon, then maybe another dog or animal companion with its own theme song could take his place.

   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a beloved indie farming RPG that simulates a peaceful life in the idyllic Pelican Town. After taking over their grandfather's farm, players can grow, charm and quest their way through the game to unlock achievements, secrets and to have an all around wonderful life.

 <p>
  To further show their affection for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , many fans of the game have created extensive, well-developed mods that allow players to explore the game even further. Mods are typically downloadable content that allows fans to adjust games to include certain aspects that the original game does not have, such as new farming equipment or easy teleportation. Some mods are built exclusively to facilitate the mechanics of the game, while others introduce entirely new areas or NPCs to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>
  There's a multitude of unique mods that show immense dedication and care, including some that broaden the dating pool for players that are looking for love.

    Updated June 11th, 2024, by Alexandra O'Leary:
   </strong>
   After Stardew Valley's highly anticipated 1.6 update, a whole wave of players have returned to the game with a renewed passion. The 1.6 update added a great selection of new content to keep players interested, and served as a great way to distract gamers while they wait for ConcernedApe's next game, Haunted Chocolatier. For those who've already made their way through all the new features of this update, mods are an excellent way to keep the game fresh and fun. Mods can impact all aspects of a game, and there's a particularly good selection for those who want to expand the dating roster. New romanceable NPCs add even more challenge and dimension to the game, and for those who want a little more love in their lives, there's a whole world of single people just waiting to fall for Pelican Town's newest farmer. With that in mind, some more mods that add romanceable characters to Stardew Valley have been added to this list in its latest update.

  The
  <strong>
   Polyamory Sweet
  </strong>
  <strong>
   mod
  </strong>
  is a little unlike the others that add additional or new marriage candidates. Instead, this mod introduces the concepts of polyamory and consensual non-monogamy to Pelican Town and allows players to have multiple partners at a time. So, while it doesn't exactly
  <em>
   add
  </em>
  partners, it opens up the dating pool substantially.

  For functional reasons, the player will likely have one main spouse (which can be changed freely), but other than that, they can have multiple partners and spouses, which will bring unique rooms to the house. It also allows the player's other spouses to attend new weddings, other NPCs to kiss, and lets multiple characters sleep in one bed. This mod is all about free love, and gives players the chance to get to know all the people in Pelican Town on another level. It even adds a new NPC (non-romanceable) to oversee the custom items that help players manage their life, and the mod is regularly updated by its creator.

  Shiko is a cool ex-model who moves to Pelican Town for a little peace after her life of stardom. This effortlessly-stylish icon comes with her own set of heart events and is completely romanceable, meaning players can marry her and have her move out of the Stardrop Saloon and into the farmer's house. Any player who wants a mysterious and glamorous partner will absolutely love this mod.

 <p>
  Isla is a very cool and unique custom NPC unlike any other denizen of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , which gives players a really fresh romantic experience. She prefers sea-based gifts and comes complete with all the heart events, as well as her own spousal room if players decide to marry her. She even has different seasonal outfits, just like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley's
  </em>
  1.6 update, and attends Pelican Town's various events - with her own dialogue and location.

  This mod does add a "new" marriage candidate, but not quite in the way players may think.
  <strong>
   Romanceable Rasmodius
  </strong>
  specifically makes Rasmodius a marriage candidate and brings 6 unique heart events as players grow their relationship with him. It also adds dozens of new dialogue lines for Rasmodius and adjusts his behaviour post-marriage. The mod works alongside
  <em>
   Stardew Valley Expanded
  </em>
  , and will need that installed to work properly.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Romanceable Rasmodia
  </strong>
  works with
  <em>
   Stardew Valley Expanded
  </em>
  or Romaceable Rasmodius to make a female iteration of Rasmodius that is romanceable. It literally turns Rasmodius into Rasmodia, and will adjust the game to fit Rasmodia's character without changing too much else. It's a perfect option for players who don't really want to switch up their game, but would like to see a cool Witch in the forest tower instead of a Wizard.

  This brilliant
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  mod adds three wonderful new NPCs, and one of them -
  <strong>
   Sterling
  </strong>
  - is available for players to fall in love with. It's a mod that specifically builds on the East Scarp mod, so players should be sure to download that one first. All three new characters, Henry, Mia, and Sterling Cooper, have unique dialogue and outfits that change based on the event and location.

 <p>
  The main draw of this mod is the new storyline it adds to the East Scarp area, but Sterling is a great new addition to the marriage pool. Although he's a little bit lost, his genuine nature makes him a very endearing and a brilliant new choice for players - particularly since he's unlike any other marriage candidate so far. The mod also adds new recipes for any players who enjoy cooking. It's worth noting that the mod does not change the weather, and the title is more for dramatic impact.

  The

   Adventurer's Guild Expanded
  </strong>
  <strong>
   mod
  </strong>
  elaborates on the monster aspects of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and adds completely new lore on where they come from, as well as additional information about the mines. Players can even become friends with a little monster companion who will come to live in their house.

  Most importantly, this mod adds two additional NPCs - Marlon's children - who move to Pelican Town to start a monster research wing of the Adventurer's Guild.
  <strong>
   Gabriel and Zinnia
  </strong>
  move to the Stardew Valley as young adults, and each of them have 6 unique events at different stages of their relationship with the player. This mod adds a whole new dimension to the mines/monster sections of the game, and both new NPCs bring something fresh to the dating pool while also giving the player a little more insight into Marlon's backstory.

  This
  <em>

  mod adds a boarding house behind the bus stop, along with a few new characters and dateable NPCs. The great part about the
  <strong>
   Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension mod
  </strong>
  is that it provides a home for any players who want to create and add their own custom NPCs without having to design a whole new area or house for them to live in.

 <p>
  Any players simply looking to jump in and date a new NPC will be happy to meet
  <strong>
   Greg
  </strong>
  , who can be found at the end of the new abandoned mine. Greg has six events that are generally mine and artifact oriented, making him perfect for players that are eager to explore the mines. Players can also romance Sheila, the daughter of Joe (who runs the boarding house) and owner of the brand new Buffalo Ranch.

  This charming mod focuses on the story of
  <strong>
   Lunna
  </strong>
  , a mysterious woman who is not quite what she seems. Lunna will be under the care of Rasmodius, the reclusive wizard found in Cindersnap Forest.
  <strong>
   Lunna: Astray in Stardew Valley
  </strong>
  adds three brand new dateable NPCs: Lunna, Bianka and Raphael.

 <p>
  Players will have to play through Lunna's story in order to meet Bianka and Raphael, but once they do, all three characters are romance options and players can marry any one of them. There are also exclusive recipes that can be unlocked for any
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  cooking enthusiasts. This mod adds an extra spark of magic and exploration, allowing players to visit Lunna's home, Umuwi, if they're persistent enough with her story.

  <strong>
   Downtown Zuzu
  </strong>
  is a cool, expansive mod that adds an entirely new area to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>
  Downtown Zuzu is more urban than Pelican Town, and offers a huge amount of new places to explore and characters to meet. Some of the best places in this mod include a busy mall, a lovely high street and an airport.

 <p>
  Regarding romance, Downtown Zuzu adds 6 brand-new dateable NPCs. Each of them are unique and interesting in their own right, ranging from shy goth-girl
  <strong>
   Gwen
  </strong>
  to uppity Joja CEO
  <strong>
   Kristoff
  </strong>
  . This mod adds an entirely new dimension to the game and the dateable characters are very much integrated into the complex new areas of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>

  Longtime fans of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  will likely be familiar with the
  <strong>
   Stardew Valley Expanded mod
  </strong>
  . It is a massive mod that adds absolutely everything to the game, expanding on the world, NPCs and even the types of fish players can catch. The amount of care and dedication put into this mod cannot be overstated.

  Along with the incredible amount of content players get from it, Stardew Valley Expanded also adds 6 new dateable characters. The familiar face of the Wizard is among these, which will delight any players who have been keen to romance
  <strong>
   Rasmodius
  </strong>
  . However, there are 5 other brand-new characters with carefully created backstories and dialogue, such as daring adventurer

  <strong>
   Looking for Love
  </strong>
  is a great mod that allows players to romance some of the other single, but previously unavailable NPCs. Some
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players, particularly older ones, can be disappointed that most of the bachelor/bachelorette NPCs are young adults. There are many players who wish to romance some of the more mature and endearing singles in Pelican Town.

 <p>
  This mod will allow players to date the likes of
  <strong>
   Gus, Clint, Marnie
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Pam
  </strong>
  . In total, it adds 9 of the unmarried, classic
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  NPCs to the dating pool which offers players new dialogue, events and spouse rooms. It is worth noting that this mod specifically builds on another mod named Siv's Marriage Mod which, unfortunately, has not been updated since 2017. Looking For Love offers updated files and relevant fixes, and is more reliable for players who are looking to dive into this new pool of dateable characters.

  Alongside
  <em>

  Expanded and Downtown Zuzu, the
  <strong>
   East Scarp mod
  </strong>
  adds an entirely new area of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  for players to explore. It includes new homes, shops and secrets to uncover, as well as a group of 10 new dateable NPCs. This allows players to experience new romance events, areas and a brand-new bird-watching aspect.

 <p>
  These dateable NPC's cover a broad spectrum, including
  <strong>
   Sen
  </strong>
  , a mine-dwelling shadow, and
  <strong>
   Aideen
  </strong>
  a well-spoken, Victorian-era enthusiast. These new marriage candidates also tie in with familiar
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  faces, such as
  <strong>
   Tristan
  </strong>
  , a rebellious but charming adventurer, who is (non-canonically) Jas' father.

  <strong>
   Ridgeside Village
  </strong>
  is another enormous mod for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley,
  </em>
  adding an entirely new village along with an incredible slew of over 50 NPCs. Longtime fans of the game will be satisfied for months while playing through all the new content, including a vast field of dateable characters. This also makes it perfect for replays, allowing gamers to choose different partners and options each time.

  Ridgeside Village offers 22 new marriage candidates, some of them obvious bachelors and bachelorettes, and others more difficult to romance. Among the bachelors are
  <strong>
   June
  </strong>
  , a gentle pianist, and
  <strong>
   Ian
  </strong>
  , a kindhearted and reliable laborer. A few of the bachelorettes include
  <strong>
   Alissa
  </strong>
  , another farmer with a flair for the arts, and the awkwardly adorable
  <strong>
   Flor
  </strong>
  . For players after the trickier dateable NPCs, there are a few secrets to winning their hearts. For example,
  <strong>
   Irene
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Anton
  </strong>
  can be marriage candidates, but players will have to dedicate time to reaching their 8 heart events in order to pursue them. Others, like
  <strong>
   Daia
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Jio
  </strong>
  , are unlocked after certain events and stories are completed.

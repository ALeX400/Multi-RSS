  When you're tired of those dark-fantasy Action-RPGs with massive worlds,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Crime Scene Cleaner
   </strong>
  </em>
  might be the perfect game for you. Offering a fresh take on the simulation genre, this game has you cleaning up bloody crime scenes, disposing of the dead bodies of the victims, gathering all the evidence that the criminal left behind, and also stealing a fair amount of money for yourself.

  <strong>
   Bad Call
  </strong>
  is the first mission in the game. Even though it mostly serves as an introduction to the core mechanics of
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  , with helpful tutorials popping up every few minutes, there is a lot that you can miss here if you don't keep a watchful eye. If you manage to clean up the crime scene perfectly, you get awarded with a perfect score for all your efforts.

  Cleaning in
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  refers to three different tasks. First, you'll have to clean the blood stains the criminal has left all over the crime scene. Second, you'll need to return the furniture where it was so there's no sign of a struggle. And finally, you'll need to get rid of all the trash, such as broken glass, plates, or anything else littering the place.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  , the criminals don't really know how to make clean kills. That's where you come in. In the mission Bad Call, there are two main areas where you’ll need to clean the blood:
  <strong>
   Dealer’s Apartment
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   The Attic
  </strong>
  . The Dealer’s Apartment is the section you’ll want to tackle first. Once all the cleaning tasks are done in the apartment section, move on to the Attic.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  You’ll need to use the broom for most of the cleaning in
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  . However, when cleaning the rag in the dining area or the canvas in the final room in the Attic, using the Sponge is a better idea. Once your broom or sponge is filled with blood, you need to take it back to the bucket and wring it out before you start cleaning again.

 <p>
  The objective marker on the top left of the screen will show how much of the blood there’s still left to clean. Once all the blood is cleaned up, the task will get marked off. Use your
  <strong>
   Cleaner’s Sense (Q)
  </strong>
  from time to time to see if there are still any blood stains left on the area.

  The Dealer’s Apartment has a lot of furniture and items that you’ll have to put back into place. There’s a guitar, a hookah pipe, two tables, two chairs, a bong, and three paintings that you’ll have to put back into place. Also, make sure you put the sofa and chair cushions back in place after wiping off the blood stains.

  For the third part of cleaning, you need to pick up all the broken pieces of glass and other junk in the location. You’ll first encounter this task in the dining area of the Dealer’s Apartment, where you’ll find broken pieces of plate all over the floor. Hold the Tab button on your keyboard to bring up your Tool Wheel and select your trash bag.

  In the final room in the Attic, you’ll also find five blood paintings that you’ll need to break and dispose of in the trash bag, since they will also count towards your perfect score in

  . Once your trash is full, right-click with the trash equipped to pull out the trash bag.

  As the one-man crime scene cleanup crew, it’s also your job to get rid of evidence that can incriminate your client. That means you’ll need to find anything that can connect your client to the murders and pick them up. There are nine pieces of evidence that you’ll need to collect: 5 in the Dealer’s Apartment and 4 in the Attic.

  There are three bodies that you’ll need to take care of during the Bad Call mission at
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner.
  </em>
  You don’t have to clean them, but you also can't just hide the bodies anywhere nearby. You'll need to pick them up, take them to the back of your pickup truck, and throw them in the trunk. They’ll automatically get put inside body bags.

  <li>
   The first victim’s body is located
   <strong>
    in the kitchen in the Dealer’s Apartment
   </strong>
   area. He will have a knife stuck in his back, which you’ll need to collect as crime scene evidence. After that, pick him up and haul him over to your pickup truck to put him away.
  </li>
  <li>
   The next body can be found when you
   <strong>
    unlock the door to the Attic
   </strong>
   in the room adjacent to the kitchen. The body drops down the moment you open the door.
  </li>
  <li>
   For the final victim’s body, you’ll need to go to the
   <strong>
    last room in the Attic.
   </strong>
   The victim will be hanging in front of a canvas. Hold your left mouse button to pick her up and carry her over to your pickup.

  The 2024 Pokemon World Championships is taking place in Honolulu, Hawaii, and features some of the best players battling it out in a variety of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, including the mainline games,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . The event teased various reveals and discussions about all things
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , as The Pokemon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara teased that Sunday's closing ceremonies would feature "special news" about the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise. In regard to the
  <em>

  The future of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  seems pretty bright, between the various trading card game expansions, spin-offs, anime, and new games in the works. While Ishihara did comment on the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise getting big updates at the end of the World Championships, it's unclear if he was referring to the mainline games or spin-offs like
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . The next entry in the long-running franchise is 2025's
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  , which was previously revealed during a Pokemon Presents showcase in February. This game sees players revisiting the Kalos Region and Lumiose City from
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  , though no information aside from its initial teaser trailer has been revealed at this time.

  A new leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is showcasing several scrapped Relics originally featured in the game's closed beta test, including their descriptions. The popular sci-fi RPG from HoYoverse features a plethora of different ways for players to power up their characters, with multiple resources to acquire through in-game challenges and the gacha system. Players can pick up new Light Cones from in-game events and through
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's gacha banners or power up their characters' Traces by farming for in-game materials. One method, however, features a wide variety of unique effects and buffs.

 <p>
  Relics are one of the main ways for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  players to upgrade their characters, with multiple different Relic sets available. Players can acquire Relics by clearing
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Cavern of Corrosion challenges, found throughout
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  's in-game worlds and the Herta Space Station. Relics provide bonuses ranging from increases to Physical and Elemental Damage to unique buffs catered towards specific characters' playstyles. Now, leaks are showing a set of scrapped Relics originally featured in the game's second closed beta test.

  The scrapped Relic sets come as fans have uncovered a variety of removed items and different resources from
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  in the past. Past leaks have shown everything from older versions of
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  's characters to completely scrapped and reworked cast members. Fans have even discovered unused game mechanics like a "dating sim" mechanic once intended for
  <em>

  While fans will likely never see the fifth and sixth pieces of Relic sets,
  <em>

  Weapon masteries are a big part of this; even

Some of these masteries simply put out more damage, while others can knock creatures prone without sacrificing damage. A fighter with three attacks and the Topple mastery has three chances to knock a foe prone (six if they use Action Surge), all without sacrificing damage. This definitely helps close the power gap between martials and casters, but it nonetheless puts monsters in a tricky spot.

  haven't been up to snuff when it comes to knocking down players. These monsters, while having a great deal of solid design, often pull punches—overweighing defensive abilities to the detriment of damage output. Fortunately, this seems to be changing with
  <em>

  </em>
  ; not only have designers already stated that the math behind calculating CR is being changed, WOTC designer Makenzie De Armas stated in a recent interview with Ghostfire Gaming's Eldritch Lorecast "Don't worry, the monsters will hit harder" in response to concerns about player power.

  The new Ancient Green Dragon statblock, revealed at an official
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  Gencon panel, seems to confirm this. This statblock, which will be part of the upcoming 2025
  <em>
   Monster Manual
  </em>
  , is far more dynamic, giving the dragon more to do as well as more health and damage. That damage is particularly important, though: the 2014 Ancient Green Dragon and its 2024 revision are both CR 22 and can make six attacks per round (if they focus out-of-turn abilities on damage), but the total average damage per round (assuming all attacks hit) is 38 points higher in 2024.

 <p>
  The jump from 124 to 162 is incredibly significant, putting the dragon exactly where it should be hitting in terms of damage. Using the encounter-building guidelines of
  <em>
   D&amp;D 5e-
  </em>
  compatible
  <em>
   Flee Mortals
  </em>
  , designed using the tried-and-tested Lazy Encounter Benchmark by TTRPG designer Mike Shea, a CR 22 ancient green dragon should be a tough solo encounter for 4-5 players of levels 15-16. Players of this level are far beyond demigod status already, especially spellcasters, so the fact that the new dragon has more bite, more health, and more options is a major boon. If all revised monsters follow this example, they'll definitely keep pace with players.

  received wide acclaim upon its release and is commonly seen as the new definitive version of
  <em>
   Persona 3

  <em>

  <em>

  will correct this soon thanks to its upcoming DLC, Episode Aigis: The Answer, which itself seems to be hiding some great news.

  Although the original version of The Answer provided a satisfying conclusion for many fans, it certainly isn't without its faults. Remakes have the gift of hindsight, meaning

  's intention to depart from this design.

  The Pros and Cons of The Answer in Persona 3
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Answer is an essential piece of
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  's story, but it's far from sunshine and rainbows. The Answer is fondly remembered among most fans now, but its reception was a much more mixed bag at the time of its release. Adapting The Answer into a modern game such as
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  presents one challenge above all else: The Answer's biggest problem is simply a result of its greatest strength.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":651} -->
 <p>
  The Answer was first introduced in
  <em>
   Persona 3 FES
  </em>
  , which was the type of expanded re-release that has become increasingly common throughout the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series. Although it was certainly satisfying on its own, the ending of
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  's original story left both its characters and players lacking some necessary closure. Thankfully, The Answer was developed in order to provide that closure. Many characters had their arcs completed, and the epilogue earned its reputation as required reading.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1147} -->

 <p>
  Although its reputation has softened significantly over time, The Answer is still remembered for the problems it raised as a consequence of its design. The Answer was designed as a linear dungeon crawl, meaning there are no opportunities for the player to go on extracurricular social outings. This is somewhat necessary thanks to the premise of The Answer, so it was lent the benefit of the doubt. However, when these outings were replaced by frustrating boss fights and a certain degree of grinding, it left some players with a bad taste in their mouths.

 <h3 id="persona-3-reload-may-fix-the-answer-39-s-biggest-drawback">
  Persona 3 Reload May Fix The Answer's Biggest Drawback
 </h3>
 <p>
  There was very little expectation that Episode Aigis: The Answer would do much to overhaul the core design of the original. After all, most criticisms of The Answer's gameplay could be resolved through simple adjustments. Meanwhile, changing its structure from the ground up would be much more demanding and unreasonable to accomplish. Despite this challenge, a recent trailer revealed that developers may intend to do the impossible after all.

  Though nothing has been confirmed,
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  's newest character trailer for Metis signals good news ahead. Eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed what appeared to be a hang-out scene with Metis in the dorm room. This is not only a departure from the original version of The Answer, but an addition altogether. In fact, it may even indicate an effort to reintroduce additional social mechanics to The Answer.

 <p>
  The announcement of Episode Aigis: The Answer was undoubtedly exciting. If
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  is going to truly feel definitive, it needs to deliver on the narrative's epilogue. The highest priority for The Answer should still be concluding the story of the original game, but gameplay will need some polishing as well if players are to have the best experience possible. While dramatic additions seemed unlikely, new information seems to be disproving this notion. Hopefully, Episode Aigis will continue to exceed expectations with future updates.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player shared a weird glitch that indicated that their Chansey had been defending a Pokemon Gym for over 50 years. The odd moment has an explanation, but it's nonetheless amusing the community to think about defending a Gym in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  for that long.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Gyms are a key part of gameplay. If a Pokemon Gym falls under a certain team's control, players on that team can leave their Pokemon to defend it, and it will return to them when the Gym is taken over by someone else. For many players, Pokemon return home almost immediately, while other defending Pokemon can end up stuck for months, if not years. However, this Chansey has supposedly been defending a gym since long before
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  came to exist.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan Frunchise shared a screenshot from their account that showed the details on their Pokemon defending gyms. All but one of the Pokemon have normal defending times ranging from a couple hours to as long as nine days. However, their Chansey named Pillow, according to the game, has been defending its position for 20,006 days, 13 hours, 45 minutes, and 5 seconds. In other words, the Chansey has allegedly been defending a single gym for nearly 55 years - about twice as long as the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series as a whole has even existed.

 <p>
  Clearly, Chansey hasn't actually been defending a Pokemon Gym since 1969/1970. This particular bug likely has something to do with the default time set on many computers and programs. Unix time, which is frequently used in computing, calculates time based on how many seconds have passed since 1/1/1970. For whatever reason, as the Chansey was getting kicked out of its gym after defending for roughly nine actual days, the time display became glitched and showed how much time had passed since 1/1/1970, rather than when the Chansey was actually dropped off.

 <p>
  While this was just a harmless glitch, fans have been quite amused by it, joking about how long the Chansey has been defending with various memes. Others have taken the opportunity to poke at how the rewards for defending gyms in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  work, saying that the Chansey would have spent all that time for a mere 50 PokeCoins. However, some pointed out that
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players have no way to bring home a defending Pokemon without it being defeated, which is considered a problem by many fans. Players should act with caution when choosing to defend a Pokemon Gym, but thankfully, no one should have to expect to welcome their Pokemon back 50 years later.

  The open-world genre of games has a diverse range of in-game mechanics that add variety to their large open-world settings. Such features include underwater mechanics, hunting, and a range of other elements, such as vehicle gameplay, that add an assortment of interesting things to do in sprawling open worlds.

 <p>
  One such component is farming; while not all open-world games have farming mechanics, some of the best open-world experiences lean on agriculture's peaceful, idyllic nature to add depth to gameplay. A popular feature of open-world games, farming allows players to relax and unwind in a recreation often overlooked in video games.

  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  is famed for its immense sandbox of procedurally generated planets that players can explore. It is also known for its rocky start and incremental change from a lackluster experience to a fully-fledged, immersive, open world. Farming is an essential part of the game and one of its best parts. In
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  , players can explore the universe using equipment such as the Haz-Mat Gauntlets to farm fictional exotic crops for crafting items and products that can be sold to merchants.

 <p>
  Examples include solar vine and frost wort, which players can farm in their base or outside depending on the planet's environment. The depth of 'space farming' in

In Terraria, players can practically do whatever they want, whether digging for treasure, fighting monsters, or opening up a peaceful farm - the choice is yours. The game features generated worlds and great farming mechanics, with the ability to plant a vast range of herbs such as daybloom and deathweed, trees, mushrooms, pumpkins, and more.

  Arguably the most influential game on this list,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  set the standard for basic farming in expansive gaming environments. Released in 2011,
  <em>

  </em>
  enabled players to build farms on a considerable scale, inspiring a new genre of titles such as
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . Like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley, Minecraft
  </em>
  also played the nostalgia card with pixelated 16-bit graphics - harkening back to the fourth generation of video game consoles such as the Super NES.

 <p>
  Over a decade later,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  and its farming mechanics are still going strong, with continuous updates adding new farming elements, such as the ability to farm bees. Due to the open sandbox mechanics of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , players have also created intricate in-game systems and methods to farm creatively and efficiently, adding further depth to gameplay.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have discovered a new broken build, and it turns the Spiritborn into a killing machine. After much anticipation,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has finally received its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, which introduces a variety of exciting content such as new areas and dungeons to explore, enemies, and the sixth playable class in Blizzard's action RPG.

 <p>
  This class is the Spiritborn, an ancient warrior from the depths of the Nahantu jungle, and is exclusive to the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  expansion. With it, players can create an aggressive character who deals great damage and moves efficiently, crossing distances quickly. The Spiritborn's greatest appeal, however, is the possibility of choosing one of four Spirit Guardians, the centipede, eagle, gorilla, and jaguar, adding a layer of versatility to the class due to the unique benefits each spirit provides.

 <p>
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players have discovered a new broken build for the Spiritborn that relies on the Sepazontec, one of the class's Unique items, and the Spirit Guardian mechanic. As demonstrated by Reddit user zirax1000, the character deals massive damage simply by using Evade. The reason lies in Sepazontec, whose Unique Afix makes the third cast of a basic skill hit three times. Since Thunderspike can reset the cooldown of Evasion with every third hit, there is the option to evade infinitely. Then, players must choose the eagle as their Spirit Guardian, making the Spiritborn deal impressive damage by simply spamming Evade, killing enemies without breaking a sweat.

 <p>
  While Spiritborn Evade is one of the first broken builds of the new class that works well for farming and has enough strength for pits, this isn't the first case. There's no shortage of examples of popular overpowered
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  builds, such as Whirlwind Barbarian, also known as “spin to win,” or Lightning Spear, which turns Sorcerer mains into Thor. The comments on the OP's video showed surprise at the build, and how effective it is.

 <p>
  While previous builds have achieved broken status at the cost of grinding Mythic Unique items and endgame content, Spiritborn Evade stands out for being a build that can be done without too much effort, while the result is impressive. As such,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players who own the Vessel of Hatred expansion who wish to try Spiritborn Evade should act fast because once the devs learn how effective the build is, the chances are that it will be nerfed in one of the game's updates, something the community has seen happen on previous occasions.

  November 23, 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . To celebrate the major milestone,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  is dropping a huge content update, along with an in-game event from October 22 until January 7 that includes tons of in-game activities and rewards, such as the new Blackrock Depths raid and upscaled Tier 2 armor sets.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has revealed the minutiae of the upcoming event to better prepare fans for the festivities. In the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  anniversary blog post, Blizzard talked about Bronze Celebration Tokens, Timewarped Badges, and myriad other currencies used in the event, as well as where they are obtained and what exactly they can purchase. Though there are hundreds of items to collect during the event,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  believes those who play regularly should be able to pick up most, if not all, of the new items from the event – especially with the help of achievements and unlocks that provide currency boosts and discounts.

  Tons of vendors can be found on the festival grounds for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  ’s 20th anniversary, many of whom offer special items in exchange for event currencies. Players can trade Bronze Celebration Tokens with Traeya for the updated
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Tier 2 armor sets, Historian Ma’di for the new anniversary rewards, and Storekeeper Reginald for items from previous anniversaries. Timewarped Badges can be traded with Bobadormu for Classic Timewalking items, Jorek Ironside and Thanthaldis Snowgleam for PvP weapons and armor, or Historian Ma’di for some returning anniversary favorites. Lastly, three Dark Iron Dwarf vendors offer gear from the three difficulties of Blackrock Depths for Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys, which drop from the raid.

  Luckily,
  <em>

  fans who can’t collect all the items this year won’t be entirely out of luck. The blog confirmed that at the very least, the new Tier 2
  <em>

  class sets will return in later years, so players will have the chance to pick up those they missed during future anniversary events.

  The Trading Post is also getting in on the fun starting in November. The free reward for completing the Traveler’s Log is a cycle of back items inspired by the factions of
  <em>
   Warcraft 3
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  class ensembles from last year are returning with their class restrictions removed, so fans should be sure to save some Trader’s Tender if they can.

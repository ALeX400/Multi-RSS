  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  hasn't been outright confirmed, but there is little reason to suspect it isn't in development and nearing release. After all, Atlus likely knows it would be leaving money on the table after the massive success of
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  . As such, assuming it is currently in development,
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  could stand to take some notes from Atlus' most recent title,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and the quality-of-life improvements its Follower system made to
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Social Links and Confidants.

 <p>
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Social Link and Confidant system has been fine until now, as
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  introduced some quality-of-life improvements in its Follower system that
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  shouldn't think twice about implementing. These improvements specifically make
  <em>
   Metaphor

  's Follower system a more streamlined and accessible experience — a characteristic
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  may need to attract newcomers.

  Metaphor: ReFantazio's Follower System Streamlines Persona's Social Link Experience

 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  's most significant quality-of-life features that
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  should take note of is the Followers' Echoes ability, which players acquire from Gallica not long into the game's main story. With the Followers' Echoes ability, players can hear the voices of their Followers when they wish to speak with the protagonist, thereby triggering
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's version of a
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  Social Link or Confidant event. Once players are notified that a Follower wishes to speak with them, they can simply access the Follower menu, select the Follower in question, and instantly travel to their location to speak with them and trigger the event.

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     To make the experience even more streamlined, players don't necessarily need to hear from their Followers first before they can travel to them, as
     <em>
      Metaphor
     </em>
     makes it possible to travel to any Follower at any time via the Follower menu.

 <p>
  Moreover, in the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series, players have been required to first speak with their Social Links and Confidants to discover which Social Stats need improvement before players can increase their bond with that Social Link or Confidant.
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , on the other hand, allows players to see which Royal Virtue (
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's equivalent of
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Social Stats) is required to increase their bond with a Follower without speaking with them first. If players attempt to visit a Follower via the Follower menu before they've heard that Follower's Echo,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  will simply inform them that the Follower might not have much to say given the current state of the Royal Virtue required to advance their relationship with said Follower.
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  should consider implementing a similar feature to cut down on players' travel time in the game.

  More's Quests in Metaphor: ReFantazio Reduce the Grinding Often Required by Persona's Attendant Links
 </h3>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Velvet Room, things can get a bit grindy when it comes to Attendant Requests. While Velvet Room Requests generally begin as simple fetch quests, they eventually become more complex and require players to create certain Personas by fusing others. Unfortunately, without a guide, attempting to create one of these requested Personas is where the grind truly begins, as it typically requires a lot of experimentation. This, as well as the often mundane tasks of acquiring specific items for Velvet Room Attendants, can make for a lackluster and time-consuming experience compared to how
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  handles its version of
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Velvet Room Requests.

  In Akademeia,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  's equivalent of the Velvet Room, players will find More, an enigmatic young man with a profound expertise in Archetypes. Not only can players study new Archetypes with More, but they can also complete quests for him that are both materialistically and narratively rewarding. Where More's quests ultimately improve
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  's Velvet Room Requests is that they are usually integrated into regular gameplay, so players don't have to focus on completing specific objectives but simply playing the game and enjoying all that it has to offer. This is especially preferable to the experimentation often required by the Personas that some Velvet Room Requests call for.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Open-World Games
   </strong>
  </em>
  often have a lot of morally complex choices, some of which can
  <em>
   <strong>
    haunt players forever.
   </strong>
  </em>
  For the sake of giving the ultimate player agency experience, some developers have gone as far as to outright turn us into mass murderers, or the most heinous villains of the story. And it often comes down to one single choice: the line that divides good from evil is very thin, and makes us wonder if we really took the right decision.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  But no matter the results, we know it's fiction, and as such, we are in a safe place to make those morally complex choices. This, of course, doesn't exempt us from suffering some traumatic experiences when things get out of control. In this list, we explore some of the games with the most traumatic quest outcomes, some of which can torment players even for years. Trigger warning: Readers should proceed at their own discretion.

  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is one of those games that has a lot of player agency, and while not every choice in the game leads to a dramatic outcome that can re-appear over and over again in our worst nightmares, there's one particular choice that has been haunting players dreams for over a decade. It is about the "Mourning Never Comes" Dark Brotherhood Quest, in which the Dragonborn turned Assassin needs to travel to the WIndhelm and slay his former lover, Alain Dufont, who is holed up in a bandit hideout not far from there.

  As an optional objective, the "client" also asks the player to kill Nilsine Shatter-Shield. Those who were not paying attention to Windhelm's lore, will perhaps miss the detail of the tragedy of the Shatter-Shield family, reduced to poverty, losing several family members alongside their Thane status. The grand matriarch of the family, Tova is often seen in the market, haggling the price of every item and stubbornly fighting against other denizens for every penny Septim she has left. Her elder daughter Friga was also murdered by a mysterious serial killer, and if the player also decides to kill Nilsine, her only remaining daughter, Tova will decide to end her life. This succession of tragic events hit unaware players really hard, even those who are playing an "evil run."

  Many
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans have seen the series hitting up the screens through Amazon Prime, and there's a famous scene in the show that depicts one of the most notorious quests in
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  that has become fuel for the nightmares of millions of players. The Hard Luck Blues, is a quest that makes the player choose between the denizens of a poor town that desperately needs a Power Core, but by robbing it from a nearby Vault, they are dooming the entire population of that vault to die.

 <p>
  The Courier has the power over the life and death of several NPCs on many occasions in the game, but this quest here is what separates human beings from simple wasteland wanderers. Some think the Vault Dwellers deserve to die, and that they always have the choice to evacuate and live on the surface like everyone else, while others say that Bethesda should have designed the quest with a third option (there are plenty of Power Cores around to be honest). Be it as it may, this has been a traumatic choice for many fans of this Open-World game.

  During our
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  run, we might get in contact with several factions, many of which are at odds with each other. But the truth is that the Steel Brotherhood (the
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  version of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  ) players come into contact with a character named Danse, a Paladin of the Brotherhood who is quite ruthless and discriminates against other sub-species, especially Super Mutants.

  The Paladin Danse Dilemma, as fans have named it, starts when the sole survivor is sent to perform a quest named Blind Betrayal, which outcome reveals that Danse is not who he says he is. Turns out he is a synth created by the Institute, and when he finds out about his own "inhumanity," Danse is tremendously distraught. Then comes the choice: Put him out of his misery, letting him live and rebel against the Brotherhood high command, or convince them to let Danse live and send him to his exile. This is one of the most morally complex quests in the game, and turns out, plants the question in the players' heads: What does it mean to be human?

  At some point between chasing down the Venatori through Thedas in search of Corypheus and murdering innocent High Dragons who peacefully "grass" around the world, players will come with a difficult choice in the game. Perhaps the most difficult one they'll find in the whole franchise. The
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series has allowed players to carry the outcome of their decisions throughout every game, and it has given us many memorable characters who have a special place in our hearts.

  Two of these are Alistair, a Grey Warden directly linked to the
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  game, and Hawke, the protagonist of
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2. Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  will make us decide to abandon one of these in the Fade to die. One has to surrender his life to "save the party," and the other protagonist, so they can stop the big bad evil who is about to lay waste to the world. So, who did the players choose? It's an impossible choice to be honest, and one that will surely torment players forever.

  CD Projekt Red did a splendid job depicting Sapkowski's taste for bitter ends and impossible moral choices, and in The Witcher 3, this is perfectly reflected in the outcome of the Questline handed by the Bloody Baron. After Geralt investigates the tragic past of the family, including the Baron's inclination for alcohol and violence which led to nearly destroying his family, it all comes to two terrible choices: Geralt (aka The Player) must decide between saving Anna or all the missing children from the nearby villages who have been kidnapped by the Crones.

 <p>
  If the player picks the first option (the most logical since Geralt needs Anna alive to track down Ciri) the evil witches will eat the children alive. If the players decide to save the children, this will have a tragic outcome as well, since Anna will be transformed into a Swamp Hag, and then will die at the hands of Geralt, breaking Tamara's heart and swearing to never see his father again. After a while, the Baron will hang himself, making everything in Gors Velen much worse, since without the Baron to keep them checked, the murderous bunch who used to be his sworn bannermen will turn to pillaging, murdering, or worse.

  Bioware has a track record of making us feel bad even if we are being Light Side-aligned Force Users. In
  <em>
   KOTOR 2
  </em>
  after landing in the perilous city of Nar Shaddaa, the Exile will see a man approaching, asking for a few credits to feed his family. If the player decides to give this poor soul some creds, Kreia will reprimand the player, lecturing them about the ripple effects every choice has, and showing us a cutscene where we see the poor fellow getting robbed and killed by some thugs.

  Needless to say, this doesn't end up here: if players took this choice, they would later discover two children and a woman in one of the lower sectors of the city, who seem to have lost their home due to her father not being able to come back with the credits he promised. Kreia's lesson taken to heart will make the hearts of the players shrink, and maybe they will think twice before being good. What was the saying? The path to the Dark Side is paved with good intentions.

  If players have ever played an open-world game, they might be familiar with things escalating pretty quickly, especially after a bad decision. But in the case of Baldur's Gate 3, this maxim is taken to the extreme by Larian Studios, who, for some reason decided that the players can fight against a squirrel in plain daylight. If the player has the skill Speak With Animals or drinks a potion that grants this effect, they will probably feel a little threatened by the murderous rodent.

  Be it as it may, the players can also assert their two-legged supremacy over the poor creature by propelling it with a rough kick. This will quickly turn into a carnage scene that is hard to forget, and even those playing the evil run must feel something afterward. A hard reminder that actions have consequences, in the most gruesome form. To top it off, if any of the Duirds in the Grove ends up witnessing this, the whole place will become hostile to the players, which will lead to further bad decisions.

  Valve recently released a new
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  client update, adding an eagerly awaited feature to the platform and fixing multiple bugs. This is one of the biggest updates that Steam has seen this year, marking an exciting time for the platform’s users.

 <p>
  A few months ago, Steam was reported to be working on a game recording feature, enabling gamers to record gameplay without needing third-party apps. The feature, which could then only be accessed in beta, was among the most eagerly expected additions for Steam users in 2024.
 </p>

 <p>
  The new Steam client update has just been released, allowing all users to use the new built-in Steam Game Recording system to capture and share footage with friends. According to Steam, the new feature will allow gamers to choose if they will use the Background Recording mode to constantly save their clips while playing, or activate it on demand. The system will also allow for quick replays of scenes and make it convenient to edit and share clips. The feature will be fully compatible with Steam Deck, work will any game including non-Steam titles, and allow gamers to use markers to reference points that they want to watch later.

 <p>
  This was not the only change in the update, which also introduced dozens of fixes, such as games crashing when using D3D9. It also addressed problems with Xbox controllers in some instances. Unfortunately, the platform has also revealed that, unlike previous Steam updates, the new version of the client will no longer be compatible with Windows 7 and 8, as well as macOS10.13 and 10.14. Users on these operating systems will not be able to install the update and won't reap the benefits of the new patch.

 <p>
  The update is not the only change Steam has made recently. Last week, Steam changed its policies for developers, forcing companies using kernel-level anti-cheat software to post a disclaimer about it. A few months ago, Steam also issued new rules advising developers to mark games with AI-generated content, and the new policy follows a similar strategy.

 <p>
  2024 has been an excellent year for Steam, which is currently bigger than ever. Back in August, Steam reached a new all-time player count peak for the second time this year, with over 37 million gamers using the platform at the same time. With Steam’s steady growth, it’s expected that the digital platform will keep releasing more updates to keep its player base engaged.

  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed slow startup on systems where the reverse hostname lookup for the loopback interface is not localhost.
  </li>
  <li>

   Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.
  </li>
  <li>
   Native titles will execute in ‘Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)’ by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment. This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions. Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with “-compat-force-slr off” on the Steam client command line.
  </li>
  <li>
   Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEODRIVER/SDL_VIDERO_DRIVER is set to wayland.
  </li>
  <li>
   Removed the UI toggle to disable Steam Play globally, correctly reflecting that Steam Play is always enabled on Linux. Steam Play was always partially active even when set to off in the UI as it is a requirement for Steam client operation.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed a case where the wrong DPI scaling factor would be used for systems using a non-gnome based session with an active gnome-desktop-portal service.
  </li>
  <li>
   Extended recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.

  <em>

   The Sims 4 is an ever-growing game, and despite the fact that it came out over a decade ago, it continues to receive more and more DLC packs. For gamers wondering what's the best expansion pack in The Sims 4, this list contains even more entries thanks to release of its latest expansion pack, Life and Death.

  Get To Work is the earliest expansion and it shows. The main focus of this pack is interactive careers. It introduces a doctor, detective, and scientist career. While they are fun to play, and the concept of following one's sims to work was unique at this point, they have struggled to remain enjoyable. The detective career, in particular, was incredibly glitchy, which meant many players struggled to progress. While some of these bugs have been patched, others still remain in the game.

 <p>
  The pack also included the first occult Sims in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , aliens, as well as the ability to run a retail store. Later attempts at occult sims have revealed flaws in the way aliens were implemented, which takes a little shine off them. Retail stores have improved over time, with extra things to make and sell, but they have also been superseded in many ways by the introduction of yard tables. The key difference is that the yard sale tables allow sims to sell their items easily without the hassle of owning a separate lot and store.

  Released in July of 2022,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  High School Years does exactly what it says on the tin. It focuses heavily on fleshing out the teen Sim experience, allowing players to control their Sims while they're at high school in much the same way that the Get to Work and Get Famous do with adult Sims while they are at work. Given that those two rank among the very worst
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  expansion packs, it should come as little surprise to learn that
  <em>
   High School Years
  </em>
  doesn't really provide players with too much to write home about either.

  To its credit, Copperdale is far from a bad world, and some of the Build/Buy items included with the expansion do an excellent job of capturing the teen vibe. Likewise, some of the new Create-a-Sim options in High School Years are also pretty decent, though aren't quite enough to fully justify the price of admission. That said, for hardcore fans of the series, younger players, or those interested in reliving their own high school vicariously through their Sim, it may be worth a look.

  Many players had high hopes for Get Famous but it can be a polarizing pack. The world of Del Sol Valley is beautiful but is also very small and feels limiting. The game also introduced interactive acting and content creation careers as well as a fame system. The fame system is slightly erratic at times and can be annoying. While the interactive career is fun at first, it can quickly lose its shine as players repeat the same jobs over and over again.

 <p>
  There are also numerous high-end expensive items with this pack. While it's fun to build an opulent mansion, their use in most normal builds is limited. It does have some quirky features though, including the money vault, but for day-to-day gameplay, unless players are very much into the fame system, this pack is unlikely to see much use.

  The Snowy Escape expansion was released in late 2020 and is built around winter snowsports including snowboarding, skiing, and sledding. It also includes Mt. Komorebi, a Japanese mountain inspired by Mount Fuji as well as several new types of wintery weather. For those wondering, players don't need to have Seasons installed to experience the latter.

  As well as winter sports, the pack also provides players with the Salaryperson career as well as several other Japan-inspired elements including items, lot assignments, and music. For those who love the holiday season or simply enjoy learning more about Japanese culture, Snowy Escape is a solid pick.

  The Cats &amp; Dogs expansion introduces four-legged fur friends into the game. Its biggest addition is the cats and dogs themselves, though players can also join the new interactive Veterinary career, which sees them run a veterinary clinic and live in Brindleton Bay; one of many players' favorite worlds.

  The cats and dogs themselves are really quite adorable and have great customization options to boot; something that will no doubt be appealing to animal-loving players. While this is certainly a solid expansion though, anyone who doesn’t really want a pet may want to take give it a miss. The world is beautiful and the catalog items are versatile, but the furry friends are definitely the main attraction here.

  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . This pack adds Ciudad Enamorada to
  <em>
   The Sims 4

  It introduces a complex attraction system that players can customize with turn-ons and turn-offs, and it allows Sims to deepen their romantic connections by putting on flirty costumes, WooHoo'ing in all sorts of locations with the romantic blanket, and going on more intricate dates. On top of this, it includes the Romance Skill, which makes it much easier to seduce others. Unfortunately, even though this pack adds interesting gameplay possibilities, it would've worked better as a game pack rather than an expansion.

  Even though many fans had been hoping for a horse-related pack for a while before it was announced, it was actually one of the expansions that took the longest to be released. The Horse Ranch expansion only went live in the summer of 2023, nearly nine years after
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  base game.

 <p>
  This pack added horses, mini sheep, and mini goats to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, the small animals are more of an extra, but the horses are quite complex creatures. The Horse Ranch Create-a-Sim menu is quite extensive, and it has nearly limitless customization options. There are a lot of gameplay features that players can explore; there are four horse skills, two human skills, and a whole bunch of ranch-related activities to indulge in. And, in a way, taking care of foals and horses in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  feels much more in-depth compared to pets from the
  <em>
   Cats &amp; Dogs
  </em>
  expansion pack.

  The strongest features of Get Together are the club system and the beautiful world of Windenburg. The club system is one of the most versatile and underused systems in the game. It allows players to form groups of sims and set club goals. This means they can gather up to 8 sims in one place by calling a meeting. It's also possible to set the dress code and decide which activities and behavior will be encouraged or discouraged.

 <p>
  There are so many uses for clubs, including boosting social needs, building skills and even calling sims to a secret underground basement, where they will spend eternity painting masterpieces. Get Together is a great pack and often underrated but earns its place here due to the fact that many of its features are often not used for regular gameplay unless players utilize the clubs. Windenburg, however, remains one of the very best worlds in the game, as well as the largest.

  The For Rent expansion pack received mixed feedback from the community when it was first release due to a series of glitches, but the developers have been working hard to fix it and improve it with each patch. Besides this hiccup in the road, it's a great pack that adds fundamental features to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Like the Seasons pack, it brings mechanics to the table that will be hard to live without once players have had the opportunity to experience them.

  Players who enjoy management games can roleplay a landlord, taking care of their rental units. Whereas fans who prefer to play legacy challenges can incorporate residential rental lot types to their gameplay to keep family closeby. On top of this, it adds tons of Create-a-Sim and Build Mode content to the table as well.

  The City Living expansion brought the additions of apartments, work-from-home careers, festivals, and the city of San Myshuno. Each of these can have a drastic effect on a player's gameplay. The apartment system allows players to pay rent to live in an apartment, paying upfront only for the furniture. This adds a new element to the game, especially for those who only use the lot traits to live in a fixer-upper home. It can also make a Sim's starter capital go much further.

 <p>
  City Living’s work-from-home careers, Critic and Social Media Influencer, have also stayed relevant for longer than other careers. While all interactive careers can be repetitive, these offer a few nice perks and fit in well with life in the city. Even if players choose to venture away from the city, the food stalls, festivals, and community lots make it a great place to visit for a change of pace.

  The "Living" packs may not be to everybody's tastes, but they do provide players with plenty of bang for their buck when compared to some of the other expansions. 2021's Cottage Living is certainly no exception, bringing with it a new world that was inspired by the UK countryside as well as numerous animals, objects, and traits.

  Those looking for a quiet life with no alarms and no surprises will love what Henford-on-Bagley has to offer, as too will nature and animal lovers. Players can indulge all of their naturistic desires if they wish, while also getting to know some of the many new NPCs like Agatha and Agnes Crumplebottom and the Chopra family.

  Discover University is arguably one of the strongest packs we've seen in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . The pack is tailored toward the entire experience of University life and as such includes a huge amount of detail. Players can take out loans, live on or off campus, join clubs, and participate in college events. While classes aren't interactive, players do have a lot of control over their Sims' timetables and there are extra work-based activities to balance too.

 <p>
  The gameplay is expansive in this pack, with many new activities to engage in on campus. Build and Buy is limited but solid and the Create-a-Sim items are very versatile. Overall, the pack offers an amazing experience for anyone who loves student-life gameplay.

  Despite releasing almost a full decade on from the base version of the game Growing Together remains a lot of fun and stays true to the core values of the series. It focuses on the enjoyment that can be derived from raising a Sim from childhood to old age, introducing plenty of great new Create a Sim and Build Mode items to help further enrich the experience. It also brings with it the bustling town of San Sequoia and the influential Robles family.

  The expansion places much more of an emphasis on choices, with certain milestones and decisions helping to change a Sim's personality and shape who they really are as a person and how they react to events. The way that Sims interact with one another has also been completely revamped, with each Sim given preferences that can determine how socially compatible they are with those they meet.

  As with other
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
  </em>
  Seasons is the game-defining expansion. While it doesn’t come with a new world, it does add so much to gameplay across the board that it deserves the top spot. Alongside seasons and weather, players also see the introduction of the in-game calendar, which allows them to schedule a wide range of events and celebrate seasonal holidays. The addition of holiday traditions, decorations, and other pop-up events rounds out this pack.

 <p>
  Adding Seasons is the biggest change across the game that players will ever see in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and adds a new depth to every home in every neighborhood. It also allows more realistic gameplay in terms of being able to add and plan regular events, including birthday parties. This is also the expansion which is the most general, adding new features that have a wide range of uses and implications.

  Eco Lifestyle was an unexpected theme that had many players skeptical at first. However, as it's been explored simmers have discovered that it's far more versatile than expected. It offers several different ways to affect worlds, including eco footprints and action plans.

  Eco footprints allow players to change the world into a green area full of beauty or plunge it into industrial smog. The pack also adds green energy, a new career, fabrication, candle-making skills, an evolving community, and so much more. It was a surprise that was well-received, pulling numerous small features together into a well-rounded expansion.

  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  Life and Death is the perfect example of an expansion pack done right. Thanks to this pack, gamers no longer need to feature their Sims dying without finishing the business they had left behind. They can leave a will with Heirlooms for their family members, dictate how they'd like their funeral to be, and even pick out their own gravestone or urn.
 </p>

 <p>
  Additionally, it brings Ghost Sims to the next level, turning them into proper and worthy Occults. As if that wasn't enough, players who aren't completely ready to say goodbye to a Sim can have them be reborn in another person's body or a body that completely resembles their own and recall their traits in a past life. This pack is particularly mandatory for legacy players, as it'll completely revolutionize the way that they play
  <em>
   The Sims 4

  Island Living is another polarizing pack and offers an entirely new way of living on the island of Sulani. There are new part-time careers, new events, and a new vibe, which includes friendlier neighbors and some stunning views. There are also a lot of small additions in the pack, including swimming, diving, odd jobs, sailing, sunbathing, and sandcastle building.

  The island itself evolves over time, linking with the new Conservationist career and allowing players to change their surroundings. Overall, the pack offers new ways to play and unique ways to build, something which is rare in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . For those who want a new way to play and a new cultural experience, the Island Living pack is, therefore, an excellent choice and arguably the best
  <em>

  expansion.

  Like the BioWare games before it,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  is expected to place a significant focus on the protagonist's relationship with their companions and the world around them, and it certainly does that. As players progress through
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's story, their character, Rook, eventually encounters several companion characters whom they must then win over with their charm and social deduction, just as every protagonist before them has been required to do. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  doesn't make that near as difficult as it has been in the past.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's Rook can't be the sole hero or heroine of the story, otherwise the game's subtitle means nothing. That being said, Rook is the leader of the Veilguard, so they are, in a sense, the story's champion. The main issue here, however, is that Rook might be too much of a champion in this
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  story, as the game seems to have been designed to give them favor in almost all their relationships, breaking a major
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  tradition in the process.

  Dragon Age Has Never Been Too Quick to Trust Its Protagonists
 </h3>
 <p>
  Trust is a common theme in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series, especially when it comes to each game's protagonist. Prior to
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's release, every
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  protagonist struggled to gain the trust of their followers and the characters they encountered throughout each narrative. It's not only a way of making the player feel like a newcomer with a lot to learn in the world of Thedas, but it also adds depth to their relationships with companions and other characters. As players engage in conversation with their companions and complete quests for them, these relationships mature on the basis of the companion's growing trust for the protagonist, eventually resulting in a fulfilling outcome in one way or another.

  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  ' protagonist may be a noble Grey Warden, but that instantly puts them at arm's length from other factions who lack trust for the Wardens. This distrust can be exacerbated even more depending on the origin players choose for their character. In
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  , Hawke is frequently forced to take sides in conflict, thereby forcing their reputation into a difficult spot with the public at large. Hawke also quickly rises to a position of influence in
  <em>

  , sparking suspicion from hesitant onlookers. Finally,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  's Inquisitor, though they eventually become the leader of the Inquisition, are still regularly held in question by some of their followers and allies, especially given the Inquisition's history of abusive power.

  Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Rook Doesn't Need to Work Hard to Earn Trust
 </h3>
 <p>
  Contrary to the protagonists of
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  's past,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's Rook doesn't need to work hard to earn the trust of their companions and other characters in the world. Very rarely is there any real conflict in Rook's interactions with their companions and the characters they meet on their travels, because everyone is so quick to trust the protagonist, no matter the player's choices. In fact, regarding choices, most of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's choices feel predestined to earn the approval of Rook's companions, and since Approval is one of the primary relationship-building mechanics in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , much of the fulfilling depth these relationships might have had otherwise is ultimately lost.

  Even Taash, who initially appears somewhat distrustful of Rook, doesn't take long to warm up to the protagonist, and it doesn't require any effort from the player to get there. Apart from them,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's other companions agree to join Rook with seemingly no hesitancy whatsoever. From there, any choice-driven engagements with these companions are either very predictable or just designed to leave a positive mark on Rook, regardless of the choice.

  All of this being said, it is much easier to write a character that is easier to trust, as well as the dialogue required to support that goal.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  certainly played it safe here, but that might also be its way of putting less focus on the relationships players build with their companions and more on the overarching threat that is arguably more important. Nevertheless, this is likely a system that fans of BioWare's past work may sorely miss, as it effectively removes the social nuances that could have made or broken
  <em>

  's relationships.

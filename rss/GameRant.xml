 <p>
  Players must complete the Test Your Courage activity to unlock the At Your Own Risk Trophy in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metaphor ReFantazio
   </strong>
  </em>
  . There are 40+ trophies in the game, while some unlock as players progress through the story, others are missable. These trophies are mostly tied to in-game events on certain dates or involve completing an optional NPC activity. The At Your Own Risk Trophy is one of the latter.

 <p>
  Once you approach the NPCs, you'll be able to interact with one of them, who's the "Spirited Youth" and he'll put out a simple challenge in front of you. Do a bungee jump from the wooden platform to test your courage. The 'Spirited Youth' will inform the protagonist that they'll fare better if they have courage, and ask for a rope fee of
  <strong>
   250 reeve
  </strong>
  to attempt the jump.

 <p>
  Once you select the "I'll take the Plunge" option, a cutscene will play, and you'll be rewarded with an increase in Courage Virtue stat. To unlock the 'At Your Own Risk' trophy, players will need to
  <strong>
   attempt the challenge a total of 3 times
  </strong>
  , with the rope thinning at every attempt and the fee increasing up to 500 reeve.

 <p>
  Once players have completed the last attempt of the challenge, they'll get a boost in Courage stats while also receiving an item, a "Foreign Coin." Completing the challenge's final attempt also unlocks the

  To secure the grand prize of
  <strong>
   7,500 dice rolls and a five-star sticker pack
  </strong>
  , you will need to hit all 46 milestones. In total, you can win up to
  <strong>
   17,965 dice rolls
  </strong>
  and various stickers for the Marvel GO album. To accumulate points in Habitat Heroes
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , you must land on the
  <strong>
   Chance, Community, and Railroad tiles
  </strong>
  across your board.

 <p>
  As a base rate, you'll get
  <strong>
   one point for Chance and Community, and two points for each landing on the Railroad tiles
  </strong>
  . However, this can be increased with the help of dice multipliers. Therefore, you should consider using high multipliers if you have sufficient dice rolls.

  First released in 2016,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  sees players taking on the role of an up-and-coming farmer in the countryside of Pelican Town. Players can farm, forage, mine, fish, and craft their way through the game while exploring the local town and meeting the residents of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . Many of the in-game locations have become virtual landmarks among the title's fan base, and a number of players over the years have used their creativity to bring these locations to life.

  's Clinic. Wanting to bring this popular spot from the game to life, OP utilized an innovative LEGO design to make a scale model of Pierre's General Store and the attached Clinic. Their LEGO model features the familiar sloped rooftops and facades of these important in-game buildings, and the LEGO recreation even sports an adorable little marquee sign for Pierre's General Store.

  Fellow
  <em>

  players applauded the incredible scale model, with many noting that it would make a fantastic LEGO set if ever made as official merchandise. Several commenters suggested other buildings that would pair well with the set, including Pierre's chief competitor, JojaMart. While many of the key locations in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  would translate perfectly to LEGO form, this design is just a fan creation and not an indicator of any official products. However, fans have voiced their interest in the idea, and many have already begun breaking out their extra LEGO to try their hand at their own
  <em>

  -inspired builds.

    Life Is Strange: Double Exposure

  </strong>
  is a narrative adventure game available on numerous modern platforms. The game features many

  One such scene is when the players

   meet Gwen Hunter
  </strong>
  for the first time. In this scene, Gwen will be trying to get hold of a book that is sealed behind a glass case and will ask Max if she is able to help her out. This scene will take place while Max is going to meet with
  <strong>
   Yasmin Fayyad
  </strong>
  , who is the mother of Max’s friend Safi.

  Players will progress through Chapter 1, hopefully finding all the collectible Polaroids along the way, and eventually go to meet . Players will be meeting and interacting with several other key NPCs during this time — including Gwen Hunter. Gwen will first be encountered in front of a locked cabinet of books, and interacting with her can have the players choose for their first meeting to start with a hug or not. She will ask Max if she is able to break into the cabinet for her to get the book.

  Max will say that anything skinny and curved should work, indicating what they should be looking for. Players will want to leave through the door they came through to find Gwen and turn left.

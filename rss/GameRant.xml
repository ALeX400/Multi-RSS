  Video games are a favorite escape from reality for many. They have engaged individuals the world over in compelling stories, as well as provided fun experiences with strangers over the internet or friends on the couch. While these experiences are entertaining, they can often resonate with individuals on a deeper level.

 <p>
  For some, video games offer stories of hope. They feature heroes facing insurmountable odds in the most trying of times, and yet, the characters find ways to triumph — or, at the least, to persevere and find moments of happiness. In these trying, uncertain times, the world needs hope more than ever. Maybe these titles can provide a small light in the darkness.

    This War of Mine

  is bleak. Run-down buildings are everywhere, and party members can be killed off instantly if one is not careful. The characters are doing what they can to survive. One can also choose to have their scavenging survivors help others survive, such as attacking a man who wants to assault a woman.

  , which recently celebrated its fifteenth anniversary, was the hotly anticipated follow-up to the celebrated
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4.
  </em>
  Joined by his new partner, Sheva, former STARS agent Chris Redfield once again faces murderous biological entities, while also dealing with villainous Wesker once more.

 <p>
  At the start of the game, Chris is feeling cynical about whether everything he does is worthwhile, considering all the lives lost. These include the apparent death of Jill Valentine, his former partner. His journey brings him to the conclusion that maybe it is worth fighting for, that there is hope for a brighter tomorrow, one without fear.

  No one in their wildest dreams would have thought of an epic action RPG uniting Disney and iconic
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  characters. Yet, in 2002,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts
   </em>
  </strong>
  launched on the PlayStation 2. It quickly became a hit, spawning a massive franchise with increasingly convoluted lore. The games’ main protagonist is Sora, who gets separated from his friends when dark entities known as the Heartless consume his world, as they have many others. He soon finds himself teaming up with Donald Duck and Goofy, as well as possessing the Keyblade, a legendary weapon capable of slaying the Heartless and sealing the pathways between worlds.

 <p>
  Hope is ultimately the driving force of this story. Sora and his Keyblade are the one hope that the universe has to combat the darkness. The hope of being reunited with his friends is why Sora keeps fighting. Even when the Keyblade temporarily abandons him, he presses on, believing in a power within him stronger than it.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </strong>
  </em>
  series is known for its fantastical adventures in Hyrule, with Link journeying across the land to protect the Kingdom and its princess, Zelda, from the malevolent and power-hungry Ganondorf.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Twilight Princess
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the darkest franchise entry to date (apart from maybe
  <em>
   Majora’s Mask
  </em>
  ). The ruler of the Twilight Realm, Zant, enshrouds Hyrule in perpetual twilight, leaving its residents as spirits doomed to live in perpetual fear. He is coerced into a partnership with the Twilight being Midna to track down a weapon that will fight Zant, in exchange for her helping him find his abducted friends.
 </p>

 <p>
  In this darkness, Link becomes a source of light. It is hope that drives Link. The hope of a champion is what sustains Princess Zelda during her imprisonment by Zant’s forces. Unlikely heroes also step up, including Midna, who ends up understanding that the fates of the worlds of Light and Twilight are one and the same. Hope is a theme that continues to echo throughout the franchise today.

 <p>
  Hope is a central theme throughout the game. The ship itself offers the promise of a better life, free from the ravages of climate change and militia conflict. Hope manifests itself in other ways throughout the game as well. Even at the end of the world, life goes on. A rock band jams out on a raft, people are getting married, and Niko’s home offers a strong sense of community, with everyone looking out for each other.

  Things cannot get much worse for Corvo Attano, the Queen's protector. Rats spread a plague in the city of Dunwall, the Queen has been murdered, and her daughter has been abducted. On top of that, Corvo has been framed for the crimes and sentenced to death. Fortunately for him, he manages to escape and connect with a rebel faction who claims to fight to restore the Royal Family. This takes Corvo on a harrowing journey for revenge, with aid not only from the rebels, but a paranormal being known only as the Outsider, who grants him unnatural abilities to fight his war.

  is a game where choices impact the story and gameplay. Corvo can carve a path of destruction across Dunwall — or keep the body count low. Areas that can be sources of infection beyond the point of no return can also be places of refuge for survivors. One optional side quest gives one the chance to save an ally’s Uncle from being murdered. Corvo’s actions will dictate the outcome of the story, whether it be light, dark, or somewhere in-between.

  is the ultimate spooky game for any fan of Stephen King. The popular thriller writer, Alan Wake, and his photographer wife, Alice, travel to the remote town of Bright Falls for some much-needed relaxation. What starts as a quiet getaway turns into a twisted nightmare, as a malevolent entity abducts Alice. This forces Alan to confront otherworldly foes called the Taken. By day, he looks for leads and gets familiar with the town's quirky residents. At night, he must fend off the Taken by shining a light on their dark forcefields.

  is a game that teaches one to have faith in the light. Light is what damages the Taken, and standing in a source of light heals the damage that he has taken. He faces Hell on Earth, but he perseveres, in the hope that he may find Alice. He does not walk his path alone, though. Along the way, he is aided by his agent and best friend Barry, as well as unseen characters leaving crates of supplies and pages from a mysterious manuscript, telling him how his own story unfolds. Although he cannot always see who or what is guiding him on his quest, he knows that they are there. There was a light, and the darkness could not overcome it.

  The second season of

  In the run-up to this premiere, Xbox and Netflix have teamed up on some new gadgets, chief among which is a new pink gamepad themed after the hit show. Called the Pink Guard Instinct Pro Controller, the device is a limited-time variant of the SCUF Instinct Pro, which has a reputation as one of the best customizable gamepads on the market right now. The gadget is currently available for pre-orders from SCUF Gaming and Best Buy, priced at $239.99, or $20 more than the regular Instinct Pro. While Best Buy operates throughout North America, its Pink Guard Instinct Pro inventory is limited to the United States. Meanwhile, SCUF offers international shipping. The controller's official release date is December 20.

  Another Squid Game-Themed Xbox Controller Is on the Way, But Won’t Be Available to Buy
 </h3>
 <p>
  The device was unveiled alongside the Game Over variant of the Instinct Pro, which is teal rather than pink. However, this particular offering won't be available in retail, but given to fans who participate in an upcoming event called Squid Game: The Experience, which is to take place in New York City at 9am ET on December 16. The event itself will take the form of a
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Nuketown tournament. The promotion will hence tie into the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  crossover with
  <em>
   Squid Game
  </em>
  that was just announced in early December 2024. The official rules for the upcoming competition are available on Microsoft's website.

  The event's grand prize won't be a controller, but a Young Hee gaming cabinet inspired by the creepy doll from the Red Light, Green Light game featured in the inaugural season of
  <em>
   Squid Game
  </em>
  . This six-foot piece of furniture comes loaded with both the Game Over and Pink Guard controllers, as well as an Xbox Series X, ROG Ally X, and Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 8. A standard Xbox Wireless Controller is also part of the package, together with a code for 12 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The estimated retail value of the prize is $4,008.95. Winning it will require achieving the most eliminations within five minutes of gameplay during the NYC event. In case of a tie, additional rounds will be played until a winner is determined.

   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  has welcomed another new free update called
  <em>
   Sew Delightful
  </em>
  , bringing with it many new free things, including Sally from the
  <em>
   Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  , like how Jack was added in 2023. With her being added, not only do players get to receive her new rewards with each level they complete, including a brand new Sally-themed dress, but there is also a new recipe for cookies that was added.

  There are many different variants of cookies that can be made within the game, but players now have a brand-new one that has Jack's face on top. These are called
  <strong>
   Halloween Gingerbread Cookies
  </strong>
  . Here's how to make these yummy-looking cookies in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley.

  Halloween Gingerbread Cookies are perfect to gift to villagers, other players, or even to use as decorations for the spooky season or the holiday season. These cookies are a three-star recipe that players can make with only the base game - considering how the other ingredients from the DLCs are locked to only those DLCs. However, players will need many of the biomes unlocked, including the last one, which is the Forgotten Lands. Below are the ingredients needed to make these cookies:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ginger x1
   </strong>
   - this can be found in Forgotten Lands growing on the ground. It will appear as a plant type, a green plant growing from the ground and that will give players the ginger they need.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Wheat x1
   </strong>
   - Wheat can be bought in plant or seed form from Goofy's Stall in Peaceful Meadow and Ancient Landing (if the player also has the
   <em>
    A Rift In Time
   </em>
   DLC). Upon planting wheat, it will require the player to water it once and wait exactly one minute for it to grow. Then, 2 wheat can be harvested.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Pumpkin x1
   </strong>
   - Pumpkins can be bought at Goofy's Stall in fully grown form or seed form in the Forgotten Lands biome. Upon planting Pumpkins, it will take 4 hours for them to grow and a total of 2 waterings before they are ready to be harvested.
  </li>

  After players have gathered all the necessary ingredients, they can mix them all together in a cooking station with 1 coral, and they will be granted Halloween Gingerbread Cookies. Once the recipe has been created, players will also see it appear in their Dreamlight Valley collection within their collection menu for reference in the future. If players would like to decorate with this dish, they can drop it, enter editor mode, and move it to where they please - like on top of a table. That's what you need to know to make Halloween Gingerbread Cookies in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  .

  Cooking is a great way to spend free time on the Gauntlet Runner in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </strong>
  </em>
  as it can lead to some of the best consumables in the game. Some of the better recipes to cook will require rare materials, some of which will also take free time just to get.

  Fishing is unlocked on your way to the Virga Islands, and can only be done when traveling by sea in that region of the world. Fishing is one of the methods for getting very useful cooking ingredients, such as the Lord Of The Lake.

  Lord Of The Lake is the hardest thing to come by when fishing, though it mostly comes down to what bait you use. Usually, the rewards of fishing are decided by the bait you use, what Heismay asks, and how you respond. To get a Lord Of The Lake, all you need is
  <strong>
   Tail Bait, as all responses to all questions will at least give you one Lord Of The Lake
  </strong>
  . While you'll always be guaranteed a Lord Of The Lake when using Tail Bait, there are some answers to each question that will give you two instead of just one.

  Where To Get Tail Bait
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tail Bait is usually incredibly difficult to find, with the only easy one to obtain being from the hurt man in the Arenafront Wharf who needs a Medical Herb. Other than that, the only other farming method is by
  <strong>
   cleaning the Gauntlet Runner's storage area
  </strong>
  . This only has a chance of giving you Tail Bait, but it's the only way to farm it semi-reliably.

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  fans have noticed that the latest batch of playable skins for the game includes several originally teased via player survey. The skins will debut with
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 on December 10, 2024.

 <p>
  It's not an understatement to say that a major motivation for many
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players to play the game is acquiring and applying new skins. Whether they're status symbols like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Mythic Weapon skins or premium purchases like one of the game's many crossover skins, players are always looking for new ways to show off their favorite characters. Now a new wave of excitement is accompanying the imminent launch of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14, which is timed to coincide with winter festivities and the holiday period.

 <p>
  In fact, some of the skins shown off by developer Blizzard in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 previews have been a long time coming. Eagle-eyed player Shiro-Aka in the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  Reddit community pointed out that at least two of the skins shown off in the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 trailer were first revealed more than a year ago in the form of a player interest survey conducted by Blizzard itself.

  Among the many skins being added in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 are a new Battle Pass skin for frosty hero Mei and a new Shop Skin for agile sniper Widowmaker. They were first spotted in a lineup of dozens of potential skin concepts surfaced by an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  player survey sent out back in December 2023. That same survey teased concepts covering a wide array of styles for the characters, including Japanese Harajuku fashion, Gothic Lolita style,
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  -inspired looks, and more.

 <p>
  As they appear in the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 preview, the new Mei Battle Pass skin is gilded in gold and adopts a fantasy "Winter Wonderland" theme befitting the season, giving Mei white hair and a winter-cloud skirt motif. The Widowmaker shop skin is a little simpler, opting for a cream winter coat and black stockings, but was given more detail and some eye-catching gold accessories to add some ornamentation beyond what was shown in the original concept art.

 <p>
  The excitement over new
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  skins shows just how critical they are to the fanbase's enjoyment of the game as it is now. With more along the way, including a crossover between
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  , it looks like fans will have plenty of skins to earn (or buy) in the near future.

  A Nintendo fan has chosen to use their old
  <strong>
   GameCube
  </strong>
  console by repurposing it as a cereal bowl. The bizarre choice has understandably shocked and confused fellow fans of the GameCube.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

  The GameCube is a beloved console for many gamers, though it didn't fare as well for Nintendo as the subsequent Wii. Nonetheless, the GameCube hosted incredible first-party games like
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Melee
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Luigi's Mansion
  </em>
  , and the original
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , among others. The Nintendo system offered impressive graphics, a celebrated controller, and a small physical footprint, so the idea of using one for something as absurd as eating cereal has left some befuddled.

  On Instagram, user evjaston shared a brief video of himself casually setting up breakfast. Evjaston pops open his purple Nintendo GameCube, pours in some Cheerios, milk, and then munches some of the cereal with a smile as he looks at the camera. Many people initially responded with horror at the idea of repurposing a GameCube this way. However, Evjaston noted that the GameCube is broken, so in a weird way, he's continuing to celebrate a game system that could have otherwise just picked up dust on a shelf or even been thrown away into a landfill.

 <p>
  Despite this clarification, some fans are still puzzled by the choice. Once recently wondered if this could possibly be sanitary, which evjaston simply responded with "Yessir" to. Presumably, cleaning and sanitizing the disc drive of the GameCube wouldn't be too hard. Whether the internal parts of the GameCube are actually foodsafe is another matter, however.

  Recycling, Reusing, and Revitalizing Old Game Consoles
 </h2>
 <p>
  Nobody wants to see their favorite gaming system die, but it's often an inevitability. Even consoles that can be repaired eventually stop having official replacement parts made and sold, which recently happened with the Wii U. When a system breaks down and can no longer be fixed, recycling it is an option, which allows the internal components to be scrapped and reused in another product.
 </p>

 <p>
  Other gamers choose to repurpose their old systems or revive them in interesting ways. One fan decided to deconstruct a dead PSP and use it as a piece of wall art that provides a look at all the interior components. Others have found ways to use modern consoles' parts to revitalize older systems, like using Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons as a Wii sensor bar. The choice is ultimately a decision each gamer has to make for themselves, though it seems unlikely that many will replicate using their favorites as a cereal bowl.

      <title>10 Best Games With Customizable Weapons, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-games-weapon-customization/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As video games become more advanced, customization has become an important part of the gaming experience. Many titles allow players to create unique characters, customizing their clothes, weapons and looks. Modifying weapons, in particular, is a fun way to change the gameplay experience, with developers able to include tougher challenges in their games.

  Players are forced to experiment, creating unique weapons to overcome different situations or to suit their preferred play style. Weapon customization is frequently found within FPS games. Online shooters offer different gun attachments, skins, or stickers that personalize the player’s arsenal, creating a more unique experience. Weapon customization can also be found in more melee-focused video games, where different effects bring new levels of destruction to simple armaments.

  The first-person action parkour game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dying Light
   </em>
  </strong>
  , places players in the quarantined city of Harran, where a city-wide zombie outbreak has devastated the population. In the game, players have access to countless weapons, from basic Wrenches and Metal Pipes to Swords and Machetes. Each weapon has a limited lifespan and will eventually break.

 <p>
  Many of the weapons in the game are designed to kill silently, as making noise in
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  attracts unwanted attention from the undead. However, players can collect various modifications throughout the game that can be attached to weapon slots, improving the armament in different ways. While some mods will improve the stability or damage, some will enhance it even further, giving an additional effect like poison, electricity, or fire. The customization in
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  may not be the most in-depth, but it does offer fun and unique weapon options for taking down the hordes of the undead.

 <p>
  Of all FromSoftware’s
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers the most customization. Players can access a huge selection of options, from clothes and armor to character creation, magic items, crafting, and weapon choices. Forging a path through the challenging world of the Lands Between might be challenging, but it offers some great ways for players to express themselves in unique ways.

 <p>
  In addition to the wide range of cool weaponry, each armament comes with a unique weapon skill, known as an Ash of War. While some of these are locked to certain weapons, many are interchangeable using the various Whetblades. Adding a new weapon skill to a sword, axe, or spear can change the nature of the weapon entirely. Throughout the game, players will find different kinds of Whetblades. These key items allow players to infuse their armaments with additional effects, such as Holy damage or Magic damage, further increasing the customization of the weapons.

   <em>
    XDefiant

  </strong>
  is Ubisoft’s new online multiplayer shooter, where different teams can play various game modes, from Capture the Flag to Dominate. While still in its early days,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  offers a fun alternative to many online games, with fast-paced action and solid gameplay.

 <p>
  While not as in-depth as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the game provides various attachments and skins for the featured guns. Players can create unique loadouts and take their favored weapons into games to level up. The higher the level, the more attachments are unlocked, enhancing the weapons further. While it’s still early days for
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  , Ubisoft has created a solid online experience that offers a strong level of weapon customization for its fanbase.

 <p>
  To help take on the dangerous denizens of
  <em>
   Necromunda
  </em>
  , players can customize their weapons with mods and attachments. Upgrading weapons becomes necessary at later levels when the difficulty increases and a higher rate of firepower is needed. The more cash players earn, the more attachments can be bought and unlocked.
  <em>
   Necromunda: Hired Gun
  </em>
  will mainly appeal to fans of the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe. However, its strong customization options and challenging gameplay offer an engaging and fun experience for fans of sci-fi FPS games.

  The third entry in the
  <em>

  </em>
  series was the biggest to date.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metro Exodus
   </em>
  </strong>
  expanded the world and gameplay of the franchise, taking players out of the underground of Moscow and into the shattered ruins of Russia. The game follows series protagonist, Artyom, as he travels across the country with his squad of soldiers on their locomotive named Aurora.

  The game features several semi-open world areas and retains its gritty survival gameplay. Players collect various weapons as they progress, which can be upgraded with modifications and attachments at the workbench found on the locomotive. These attachments enhance the weapons in different ways, giving players a higher level of freedom. Fans will love the final part of this exceptional FPS trilogy, with the story, gameplay, and mechanics all improving from the first two games.

  Bethesda’s
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series has steadily grown since its humble RPG beginnings. The franchise is now one of the most well-known in gaming, with a successful TV adaptation recently released. The last major single-player release in the mainline series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , brought new and improved mechanics that offered players new levels of customization.

  Almost every weapon in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  can be modified in some way to improve its performance. These attachments are crafted on workbenches after players have progressed to the right level and collected the right materials. Customizing in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  can make the most basic weapons deadly armaments, ensuring even the most dangerous Deathclaw is soon taken care of.

  Players can create a unique character and customize weapons with mods. These mods are unlocked through different challenges — or purchased with Continental Coins. Each mod gives a weapon both positive and negative effects, allowing players to choose their preferred play style. In addition to modifications, weapons can be customized with different colors and patterns, which offer another level of personalization.

  Part of one of the biggest franchises in video game history,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone

  </strong>
  continues to be a major force in the online world with its fast-paced battle royale. Players compete against each other to be the last team standing as the gas slowly closes in. Supplied with a range of weapons, perks, and special killstreaks, the game is chaotic, fun, and unforgiving.

  Weapon customization is a big part of the game, with players creating unique loadouts.
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  not only offers a large range of weapon-enhancing attachments, but it also provides fun and unique skins, stickers, and charms that personalize the player’s weapons. Warzone provides a high level of weapon customization that few other online multiplayer games offer. While the game is far from perfect, often being plagued with cheaters, its extensive weapon mods and colorful skins allow players every chance to achieve victory.

  Previously, players saw significant buffs coming to all five classes with the release of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  update 1.4.3, improving the overall performance of all of them. Blizzard used the update to make
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's endgame content more accessible and enjoyable, reducing health and damage levels in the Pit, reducing the health of Tormented bosses, and squashing bugs that hampered players' experience at the time. Now,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is gearing up to get the next update in a few days and reveals what players can expect from it.

  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has released the patch notes for update 1.4.4, which will arrive for all players on July 10. The update will make the selling price of summoning materials more expensive, with Blackened Femur, Gurgling Head, and Trembling Hand, part of the materials for summoning Echo of Varshan, going from 20,000 gold to 50,000. The selling price of the Stygian Stone will increase significantly, jumping from 70,000 gold to 150,000. The overall drop rate of Elixirs will be reduced, making it more difficult for
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players to obtain these items that grant temporary buffs.

  Update 1.4.4 will adjust
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Tempering system, increasing manual drop rates to make them more consistent. Tempered affixes will have an icon associated with the Tempering category, instead of the same icon for all Tempered affixes, making it easier to distinguish. The July 10 update drop will provide an assortment of accessibility, gameplay, interface, and user experience fixes and improvements. Some cases include fixing the bug in which players were losing boss summoning materials when transferring them to a new character, and the Barbarian's Weapon Expertise icons, which were using the same image.

  While
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players will likely enjoy the tweaks and improvements of yet another Season 4 update, the community is also looking to the future. With the start of Season 5 expected next month, many new features will be coming to the game, such as
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  adjusting the Helltides to make endgame activity more rewarding. The next
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  season will also add a new mode, new consumables, and Unique items, promising another shake-up to create a player experience potentially even more engaging.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Epic Games has revealed that the online game is once again on track for its iOS return, after claiming that Apple had rejected its Epic Games Store application earlier. Apple is set to welcome
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  back on the App Store for the first time in almost four years.

 <p>
  For years, Epic Games Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney has been critical of digital storefronts like Apple charging a 30% tax on in-app purchases. Back in August 2020, Apple delisted
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for bypassing the former's in-app payments system and, hence, violating the App Store's guidelines. This incident led to a number of court battles between Epic Games and Apple as the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  creator worked to bring the game back on the platform. While
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's future on iOS is still unclear in US jurisdiction, it got the green light for a return to iPhones and iPads in European Union (EU) countries earlier this year, courtesy of the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).

 <p>
  As Epic Games prepares to bring
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  back on Apple devices in the EU, it revealed submitting a notarization application for getting the Epic Games Store up and running on iOS. In a tweet posted earlier today, the Unreal Engine developer criticized Apple for rejecting its application for a second time. It underlined that the iPhone maker made that decision because the installation button and the in-app purchases label on the Epic Games Store were "too similar" to those on the App Store. Clarifying that it is using the conventional standards for those elements, Epic Games denounced Apple's call as "arbitrary" and "obstructive" and said it had called upon the European Commission to resolve the matter.

  In a new development, Epic Games has given an update, saying Apple has changed its mind on the first instance of the application that was submitted. The quick turnaround was surprising as it came hours after the gaming giant had panned the smartphone leader for delaying the highly popular battle royale game's comeback on iOS. The latest news is a big boost for Epic Games and marks another step towards its revival on Apple devices in the EU.

  While the game's return is still underway, Epic Games has already shared an expected timeline with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  fans. According to it, the game will be back on Apple's platform in the "next couple of months." Apart from the App Store, the Tim Sweeney-led company also has plans to release more of its games on other digital stores available on phones.

  A gamer's father has given them an incredible gift in the form of a
  <em>
   <strong>
    Zelda: A Link to the Past
   </strong>
  </em>
  3D map. The map was created with a 3D printer and serves as a great way to highlight many fans' favorite SNES-era
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  </em>
  has been a popular entry in the franchise since its release back in 1991, and the return to its world and an extension of its story in
  <em>
   A Link Between Worlds
  </em>
  only solidified this status over a decade later. The overworld map is one that most fans will strongly remember, and this 3D print replicates its top-down view nicely.

 <p>
  Reddit user That_Guy_Reddits shared their recent gift from their father with fellow
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans, and the creation is impressing players. The
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  overworld map has been created in simplified detail but is accurate to the map seen in the game. The style is similar to a raised relief map, with details like Death Mountain and The Tower of Hera standing higher than areas like Hyrule Castle. The map is surrounded by a black border with a little Triforce, completing the charming creation.

 <p>
  Other
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans have been quick to express how impressed they are with the creation. Most of the responses were in awe of how cool the gamer's dad is for doing something like this for them. A few also mentioned that they wanted one for themselves. Those with a 3D printer are in luck, as user Black3ternity shared a link where fans can download the files to print out a version all their own. Others shared ideas on how the 3D print could be used, other than simply displaying it. One fan thought about using it as the base of a board game, while another suggested using it to play
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  with. While the OP didn't express how they intend to use it or if it will simply be put on display, it seems a lot of players are envious of both the 3D printed
  <em>
   Link to the Past
  </em>
  map and having a dad that appreciates gaming this way.

  Zelda Maps Have Changed
 </h2>
 <p>
  Although the 3D print is a simplified version of the
  <em>
   Link to the Past
  </em>
  map, one of the things that stands out looking at it is how miniscule the map is in comparison to more modern
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games. To be fair, both
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   A Link Between Worlds
  </em>
  featured alternate versions of the standard Hyrule overworld to explore as well, essentially doubling the explorable area. Games like
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  and the massive
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  still dwarf the older games' maps, though, and it's been interesting to see how the world of Hyrule has evolved through the years and following major disasters.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Simpsons
   </em>
  </strong>
  have been dominating the silver screen since their debut way back in 1989, making it the longest-running American scripted prime-time television series. During the 90s,
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  blossomed, becoming one of the most loved TV series and gaining a massive following.

  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  was developed into a multimedia franchise, spawning comic books, toys, a movie and, of course, video games. Some of these games were better received than others, with some clearly cheaply made to cash in on the brand. But there are a select few that are not just amazing Simpsons games but are regarded well as standalone video games.

However, there are still a lot of Simpsons games for fans to enjoy and this updated article gives fans a better idea of the

  The popularity of
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    WWE
   </strong>
  </em>
  were intertwined with both blooming in the 90s and early 00s, so it made perfect sense that the yellow family would crossover into the combat world with
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Simpsons Wrestling
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Although it was fun to see the 20 playable
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  characters fight and perform their own moves and special moves, the game was bombed by critics. The graphics and gameplay were slated, the game was just a button masher. The Simpsons Wrestling was praised for its audio track and having an authentic voice cast. If gamers are looking for a wrestling game, they should look elsewhere, but for a nostalgic
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  experience, this game is perfect.

 <p>
  The objective of this one is to navigate through mazes to exterminate rats with characters from Krusty's in-game show and Bart and Homer serving as bosses on each level. The game was really well-received at its time of release in the 90s with fun and strategic levels. The game was known as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Krusty's Super Fun House
   </strong>
  </em>
  Super NES and the Mega Drive/Genesis to reflect the better graphics on those consoles and perhaps a little nod to a certain Italian plumber.

  The second ever

  game ever produced and the first on console,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Simpsons: Bart vs The Space Mutants
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. Gamers could play as Bart Simpson, as the Simpsons' son looks to stop aliens from taking over Springfield.

 <p>
  Playing very much like Super Mario, Bart must jump on the Alien's heads to defeat them, as he progresses through each level which increases in difficulty. The game is very much a challenge with aged controls, but it is still a fun experience, even in comparison to modern games. It is a solid entry in the franchise but there are some which play better.

  gives players the chance to explore Springfield in a 3-D world for the very first time. Using an in-game device called the Really Virtual Viewthingy, players can interact with their environment and solve puzzles to progress through the game. The overarching objective is to collect character cards in the town.

  Although the gameplay can get repetitive at times, the comedy and scale of the game, especially when it was released, received a lot of praise. There isn't another Simpsons game quite like it, and it is truly an awesome experience for fans of the franchise. Even today, players can find enjoyment in playing
  <em>
   The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield,
  </em>
  even if there are better games on this list in terms of genuine gameplay.

 <p>
  Taking inspiration from the popular Treehouse of Horror episodes of
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  , this Game Boy Color side-scrolling platformer was highly praised at the time. Gamers can play as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie in levels based on episodes, with each one being unique.

 <p>
  The game actually poses a challenge, complete with beautiful artwork and engaging gameplay, Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror is certainly one of the better Simpsons games that have been released. Even if it doesn't live up to the modern style of video games.

  The graphics aren't great, Springfield is poorly detailed, and the controls are questionable, to say the least. But, the game has a certain charm to it and fans of a certain generation hold this game with high regard. Without this game,
  <strong>
   there wouldn't be the best

  <strong>
   ever
  </strong>
  , so this allows for a high enough ranking.

   <em>
    The Simpsons: Arcade

  is a beat 'em up game much like

    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game

  </em>
  and

   <strong>
    Yakuzu

    </strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  The genre was very popular in the 90s on arcade systems. The Simpsons dabbled in this, with the game first appearing as an arcade game, later being ported to Commodore 64, MS-DOS and much later for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

  Being the first in a series always allows for higher ranking, but this game is genuinely amazing. Fans could take control of their favorite
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  characters for the very first time and fight opponents to progress to the next stage. A really fun experience but also one that was groundbreaking when it came to The Simpsons video games.

  Released in 2007, the same year that
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Simpsons Movie
   </strong>
  </em>
  came out in cinemas, it was a fantastic year for fans of the franchise. This is a must-play for casual and hardcore fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Simpsons
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but was criticized for its repetitive gameplay, troublesome camera system and short run-time. However, the good certainly outweighs the bad on this one and it deserves its ranking
  <strong>
   as one of the best
   <em>
    The Simpsons
   </em>
   video games

  .

   <em>
    The Simpsons: Tapped Out

  </strong>
  is a mobile game where fans can create their own version of Springfield using the iconic buildings and locations that were present in the series. Gamers can complete missions, and daily objectives and tap on buildings to receive cash to buy more items.

 <p>
  A very big criticism of this game is the use of micro-transactions, as the richer players can cheat their way to the top using real-world cash. However, this game doesn't require that and there is enough free content in the game to make it really enjoyable. The more time and effort that fans put into this one, the better their world will become, which gives a great sense of reward. Despite its release in 2012, the game is still regularly updated and fans of the franchise should definitely give this one a go.

  Highly regarded as one of the best games of its era, this game goes beyond just an excellent
  <em>
   The Simpsons

  video game, but just a really awesome one in its own right. There are tonnes to collect from character cards, vehicles, and secret vehicles across varied areas around the town. The graphics, gameplay and playability were ahead of its time, and it is a real shame that there has yet to be a sequel, which is much requested by fans.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  player online has shared a clip in which the game appears to punish them for performing a killmove. The
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  video appears to be caused by an unfortunate glitch occurring at the exact wrong moment.

  Like any Bethesda game,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  features its fair share of glitches. It was definitely worse upon its launch well over a decade ago, but Bethesda has slowly worked to patch the gamer so that it is free of many of its most game-breaking issues. Nowadays, most
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  glitches are on the funny side, providing moments of madness that don't actually break the game in any substantial way. A perfect example of this is the
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  glitch that saw a player get threatened by a fish, which was another hilarious way things can go wrong in the game.

  Redditor Z7_309 shared the bizarre
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  video, in which they die in the immediate aftermath of performing a killmove on a Draugr. It almost seems as though they're being punished by the game for the killmove, even if it's unlikely this is actually the case. One user in the thread joked, "You had a heart attack from the thrill of victory." To top off the weird clip, it ends with a
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  College of Winterhold quest being started out of nowhere.

 <p>
  It was generally agreed in the thread that this had happened because of an unfortunate
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  glitch. They had already been dealt the killing blow by the attacking Draugr, but the killmove had already begun.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  doesn't interrupt killmove animations for any reason, in this case, death. Despite this explanation for the killmove issue, very few have solid theories about why the College of Winterhold quest began after death, making this an unsolved mystery in this case.

  With the majority of the work on
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  now behind Bethesda, it's presumed that
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is finally next on its list of priorities. The game was first announced back in 2018 with a teaser trailer, although the studio has largely been radio silent on the project ever since. As of the most recent update earlier this year,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is in a playable state, although it isn't clear how this actually translates to a solid release date. Hopefully, it isn't too much longer before Bethesda is able to begin giving more concrete updates about one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.

  Mystery stories have existed forever, and have changed to fit countless mediums. Arthur Conan Doyle's
  <em>
   Sherlock Holmes
  </em>
  books, crime-solving detective TV shows, and suspense movies that task ordinary people with impossible puzzles are all an extension of the mystery tale. Some games stand out as exceptional examples of mysteries that players can solve as they play, stories that unfold ahead of them to allow fans to use their deductive reasoning and logic to uncover the narrative.

 <p>
  A surreal and supernatural adventure that walks the line between gritty detective drama and tense survival horror,
  <em>
   Deadly Premonition
  </em>
  starts with a murder case. Fans will become York, an FBI investigator looking into a series of murders, the latest of which took place in a remote American town. The killer, who comes to be known as 'the Raincoat Killer' will ambush York across the map but the pace of the investigation is left up to the player. Fans are let loose in the town where they can walk or drive to get to different interactions with NPCs to interview. Shaving and cleaning their suit means they look more presentable and may get a bonus: they can spend their money on more fuel for the car or on cigarettes to wait for a few hours.

  The realism in this simulation makes the visions of demons and paranormal worlds incredibly effective, and York will have to battle his way through constant opposition to reach the shocking ending. This paired with a lovable cast and the peculiar survival aspects make this perfect for stepping into a crime-solver's shoes and feeling like players are part of the world.

  Putting players in the eccentric mind of one of the most famous names in detective story history is a daunting challenge, but
  <em>
   Frogwares'
  </em>
  valiant attempt with
  <em>
   Crimes &amp; Punishments
  </em>
  is as close as any game has come. All of the expected abilities that Sherlock demonstrates in his stories are here, with a scanning function to identify intricate details about the characters he interacts with and his uncanny ability to reconstruct a crime scene or develop a hypothesis based on only the autopsy. Players will be presented with all of the information that Sherlock gathers, and will then be able to link these pieces of the puzzle together on the 'deduction board'.

  When an evil mechanical bear appears in a private school and tasks the students with killing each other but getting away with it, the stakes are instantly pretty high. Despite the larger-than-life premise, the game becomes a crazy tale of intrigue with a real focus on dismantling the excuses and arguments of the protagonist's classmates. Play is split into three segments: daily life, where players can speak to other students to gain information and get closer to them, free time, where players can gift their favorite characters presents to get more clues to use in the trial and finally deadly life, during which the class hold a trial to decide who the killer is.

  Players will need to utilize all of the information they have uncovered to make the correct logical leaps and shoot through the classmates' arguments with bullets of truth. While it is wacky, any crime-solving gamer will love sinking their teeth into the complex cases in Danganronpa.

  A blast from the past,
  <em>
   Hypnospace Outlaw
  </em>
  makes players into keyboard cowboys who have to use the retro interfaces of the 90's era internet to track down cyberbullies, copyright infringement, and other strange criminals that lurk in the corners of the early web. With a whole host of nostalgic additions, like screensavers and goofy mouse pointers, players can take a trip down memory lane while investigating disturbing content, strange conspiracies, or just loopy lunatics. For players who remember MySpace and who want a backlog of cases to solve that range from hackers to cult webpages, this is the game for you. A modern mystery for fans of the techy side of crime.

  A modern title that borrows the best from the genre to combine into an amazing deduction game,
  <em>
   The Case Of The Golden Idol
  </em>
  follows the valuable relic that seems to hold some kind of ancient powers. Across fifty years, the player will have to explore locations to collect any clues and information that they can to then piece together to solve a series of murders. All while the crime scenes replay over and over, letting players search the character's pockets, see what they have said in the prior moments, and see events unfolding precisely as they did.

  As players place the clues they have collected into a statement that sums up the suspicious happenings, fans will follow the Golden Idol across time and see all of the corruption and killing surrounding the piece.

  A series of PC games that are all solid, with a few amazing standouts, the
  <em>
   Nancy Drew
  </em>
  series is a staple in the crime-solving genre. Players step into the petite shoes of the titular teen and will journey around maps, make allies, interview witnesses and suspects, and complete fiendishly difficult puzzles to finally arrive at the conclusion of the stories. Nancy Drew's quirky sense of humor carries the games to silly heights, and the puzzles are genuinely quite difficult and can make for thoughtful experimental gameplay.

   Immortality
  </em>
  puts players straight into the place of a sleuth who is searching through old movie footage. Three films starring a young up-and-coming actress, over a few years, were never released and now the actress has gone missing. Players have to trawl through old film reels, uncovering more footage as they go, to piece together the story. What appears at first to be a story of torrid affairs and awful accidents quickly becomes a supernatural tale of murder and possession.

  After not being seen for five years, the missing ship 'Obra Dinn' drifts into port in 1807. An insurance investigator is dispatched to find out what happened to the crew and what went wrong. That's where players come in, aboard an empty ship and using their deductive reasoning to uncover the answers. The art style, a monochromatic and pixelated blur that is beautifully captured, presents the whole case in a perfect package. Players start with a logbook with the names of the sailors aboard and the ship's planned course, which is filled out slowly as more details are gathered.

  The player can also use a pocketwatch to rewind and see the final moments of any corpses that are found on the ship, which can enable more detailed discoveries and for the events that conspired against the crew to be more and more fleshed out. The game has been praised widely as one of the best mystery games of all time, and fans will see why when they start to deduce how the killings and corruption took place.

He has drunk so much that he has given himself amnesia, but after he heads downstairs and meets his new partner, he is plunged into a tense world of clashing ideologies, corruption, and poverty. And a man is dead.

  Fans of the game praise
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  for the systems that see the protagonist talking to every character on the map and going up against skill tests to determine if he will manipulate, lie, or feign ignorance towards them to inform how much he can get out of every possible witness. With incredible writing and a tendency to dwell on the detective's inner turmoil,
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  is a quality mystery story that players will love to uncover.

  The Bloodfiend’s Arm is a colossal club-type weapon introduced in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  DLC. Colossal weapons trade speed for raw power, dealing devastating damage to enemies. They are also excellent at breaking enemy posture, which allows you to follow up with a critical hit.

   Bloodfiend's Arm
  </span>
  is a blood-infused weapon, which means that it retains its bleed-building ability even after infusing it with a non-bleed affinity. The Bloodfiend's Arm is a guaranteed drop from one of the Bloodfiend's inhabiting the Prospect Town in Shadow of the Erdtree. The weapon was recently nerfed to scale down it's bleed effect, but the club still continues to outperform other bleed weapons in the game. Here's how you reach the town and acquire the weapon.

Additionally, it is now confirmed that the weapon drops from one of the six Bloodfiends in Prospect Town.

  To acquire the Bloodfiend's Arm, you must first travel to Prospect Town. You can reach this location by beginning your ride
  <strong>
   from the Gravesite Plain Site of Grace
  </strong>
  , and then travel north until you discover the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace.

 <p>
  Now, ride west from the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace and
  <strong>
   refer to the image above to circle around the large hill
  </strong>
  . If you stick to the ridge along the hill, it will lead you to the Cliffroad Terminus
  <strong>
   Site of Grace

 <p>
  Now, travel south toward the decrepit town, and look for a destroyed wall covered by black cloth. Go up the rubble to reach an elevated area, and follow the wide, disconnected stairs to reach the top of the ruins. At this point,
  <strong>
   you’ll find a fallen pillar serving as a makeshift bridge
  </strong>
  . Use the pillar to scale the narrow, ruined wall, and follow it west to reach Prospect Town proper.

  The Bloodfiend’s arm is a
  <strong>
   Strength-based weapon, but it scales well with both Strength and Arcane
  </strong>
  . The club comes equipped with the Endure Ash of War that briefly increases your poise and negates damage. However, if you want to get the most out of the Bloodfiend's Arm, you'll want to replace the Endure weapon skill with other high-damage dealing Ashes of War like Royal Knight's Resolve, Lion's Claw, or Savage Lion's Claw.

  Being able to personalize your character is always a core and much-appreciated aspect of a role-playing game.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Once Human

  , unfortunately, leans too much on the selling aspect.

  The new free-to-play game offers a fairly deep character creation screen to let you build the ultimate character to bring order to a post-apocalyptic world. While not as hectic as the
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  character builder, you can spend a lot of time playing with numerous sliders to change facial and body features.

 <p>
  However, should you skip the character creation by selecting a pre-made character, the only way to change your name and appearance afterward is to grab your wallet. Here is what you need to do in case you are rethinking your character options in

  , one of the many premium items that can neither be looted nor crafted in

  Head into the pause menu by pressing Escape, and then click on Shop Events to find the Shop. You can also open the Shop directly by pressing F2 on your keyboard at any point in the game. In the Shop menu, click on Other and then select Renaming Card.

  Similar to how you change your name in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , changing your appearance requires another premium item called a
  <strong>
   Chrysalis Token
  </strong>
  . It is also exclusive to the Shop, and cannot be obtained for free through looting or crafting.

     Unlike Renaming Cards, Chrysalis Tokens are pretty expensive. They cost 480 Crystgin each. You have no choice but to buy the $15 pack which gives 1090 Crystgin.

 <p>
  Once you have bought a Chrysalis Token from the Shop, head back into the game and build a Floor Mirror. Open the build menu by pressing B on your keyboard, and then select Furnishing Items under Furniture to find the Floor Mirror. It costs 20x Logs and 10x Glass to make and must be built in your territory. If you are short of space, place more Wooden Platforms to expand your territory in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Interacting with a Floor Mirror will consume a Chrysalis Token and let you access the character creator screen in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . You can then spend as much time as needed changing your appearance, facial features, hairstyles, skin tones, markings, etc. It is only a one-time use, so make sure to get the exact appearance you want before pressing confirm.

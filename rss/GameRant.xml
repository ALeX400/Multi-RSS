      <title>7 Days To Die: Best Ways To Get Through The Night</title>

 <p>
  Provided the player hasn't changed the settings, all zombies run at night. This increases the game's difficulty and makes the nighttime quite a tense time, especially during the early stages of the game.
  <strong>
   <em>
    7 Days To Die
   </em>
  </strong>
  is filled with dangers. Even during the day, it's a pretty dangerous place.

 <p>
  Newer players may be tempted to hide and stay quiet during the night. While this may seem like a good idea, it isn't very productive. Players will need to manage their time wisely to survive Blood Moons. So, if the player spends large amounts of time just waiting for the sun to rise, then they aren't likely to survive many horde nights.

  Those who have played the old console version will remember a time when they could improve the quality of an item simply by crafting a new one. While those days are gone, players can still craft improved items and mods to further boost a weapon or armor piece's efficiency.

  If the player doesn't want to venture out at night, then they should take a look at their armor pieces and weapons.
  <strong>
   They may be able to craft some mods,
  </strong>
  improve their pieces, or craft new items at a workbench that are better than what they currently have.

  Horde nights are tough. Multiple waves of enemies will zone in on the player and do their utmost to kill and devour them. If the player is hiding behind a couple of wooden blocks, then things probably won't end well for them during a Blood Moon.

  <strong>
   Players should conduct repairs, upgrades, and improvements to their base during the night.

  While this may involve venturing outside the safety of their base to fix some external pieces, should some zombies spot the player, then they can simply run back inside their base.

  Mining plays a big part in
  <em>
   7 Days To Die.
  </em>
  Players will constantly need to have certain resources to craft everything from weapons and armor to meds and ammo. Since clearing POIs is much more dangerous at night, some players may prefer to head underground where things are a bit safer.

 <p>
  With a few concrete blocks and a couple of sturdy doors to block the entrance, players can mine through the night. Then, when the day breaks, they can place all of their resources into a forge and head off for a day of zombie killing.

 <p>
  While mining underground is safer than clearing POIs, there are still a couple of dangers that players will need to look out for.
  <strong>
   Mine collapses can be deadly
  </strong>
  . Players need to think about structural integrity while mining. To avoid any collapses, players should place some wooden pillars every now and then to support the ground above.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":199} -->
 <p>
  Also, mining can attract screamers. Since mining generates heat, it has the potential to attract screamers. While the player can crouch to reduce the amount of heat they generate while mining, there's still a chance for a screamer to spawn. So, be sure to listen out for any unwanted visitors while mining. Always carry a good weapon and have an exit plan in mind, just in case.

  As the days tick on, players will start building up the confidence to head outside and explore. While the trader settlements are closed during the night, players can still complete any active missions. Most traders have a few missions that can only be done during the night.
  <strong>
   These are great for farming XP.
  </strong>

 <p>
  Night missions are relatively straightforward. Players will need to head to a certain location, fix a generator, and clear out any zombies. Missions that require the player to clear out zombies are great as they highlight any nearby mission zombies on the player's HUD.

  This can help to reduce the chances of any zombies sneaking up on the player. Provided the player places a door over the POI's entrance to prevent any wandering zombies from popping in, they should have no issues clearing out a POI at night. Just be sure to bring a decent weapon, some good armor, and some meds.

  As the player does things like mine, build, smelt, and craft, they will generate heat. This heat has the potential to attract screamers. Most players will already know that
  <strong>
   screamers can scream to attract other zombies.
  </strong>
  When done correctly, the player can use a screamer to their advantage.

 <p>
  Provided the player has a reasonably sturdy base, they can use the screamer to farm XP. The zombies that the screamer will summon tend to be tougher zombies like cops and military zombies. These give out some decent XP when killed. Also, if the player is yet to complete challenges like killing 50 cops or 50 big mammas, then a screamer can be a great way to get these challenges done fast.

  Thanks to its free-to-play structure and unique blend of Lovecraftian horror and survival mechanics,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers an engaging experience. Although there is an option to purchase a monthly battle pass for extra rewards, the entire game remains accessible to those who prefer to play without spending. Players have the option to join a PvE server for a more cooperative experience or dive into a PvP server if they prefer competitive combat.

  <strong>
   Fishing in
   <em>
    Once Human

  </strong>
  is quite rewarding. There are quite a few different species to catch, some preferring saltwater, and others preferring a freshwater environment. Finding the right bait is crucial to catching the largest specimens in this survival shooter.

  <strong>
   Northern Pike
  </strong>
  is one of the largest fish that a player can catch when fishing in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Furthermore, this large predator is the basis of two amusing melee weapons. As a predator, it can only be caught using some form of predator bait such as minced or live bait, although it will sometimes take a lure.

 <p>
  The best place to catch the biggest Northern Pike seems to be the coastline in the top northeastern zones of the map, although this may change as subsequent seasons open up new areas that are currently unavailable to players.

   Salmon
  </strong>
  in
  <em>

  Most of the rivers in the southwest part of the map have Salmon, with Chalk Peak being the best place of all to catch a huge Salmon right now, although this could change in the future, of course. Salmon grow pretty large in
  <em>

  </em>
  , and look great stuffed and hung on the wall in a player base.

  <strong>
   Arowana
  </strong>
  are an odd-looking fish in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . They are not predators, so they won’t take a lure or minced bait. It seems to be possible to catch Arowana in any body of fresh water, either lakes or rivers.

 <p>
  Some of the best Arowana fishing is along the bottom of the Chalk Peak zone, close to the estuary where many rivers meet up. This area is literally teaming with fish, and Arowana can be caught there, although it might take some time to catch one as they are quite rare even here.

   Barracuda

  These fish seem to be most common in the western map regions, a short way up from the new player area. Following along the coast here will lead the player to a fishing jetty with a fishing vendor, and this is a great spot to catch big Barracuda while fishing in
  <em>
   Once Human

  It can take some time to catch a good-sized Koi Carp in
  <em>

  n, as they are quite rare and not frequently found. However, they do look really good when mounted on a fish rack in a player base, due to their bright colors and size.

  Most people believe that
  <strong>
   Rainbow Trout
  </strong>
  are non-predatorial. However, in the real world, Rainbow Trout are omnivores, and eat both plants and insects. Maybe this is why they seem to like the predator lure when fishing for them in

  They seem to populate only rivers, and not lakes in

   Pompano

  is a funny-looking sea fish in
  <em>
   Once Human. They
  </em>
  are short and fat, and can grow to huge sizes. They are one of the rarer saltwater fish that players can try to catch, and it is not uncommon to spend several hours catching lesser fish before landing one.

 <p>
  Oddly though, the standard bait seems to work best for this rare fish. The only real effort required to catch one is waiting, and the frustration of catching other species before landing one. They are unique-looking fish, and it is quite an accomplishment to catch one.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40,000
   </strong>
  </em>
  has had several video games attached to its name. Given its roots as a tabletop battle simulator, it's hardly surprising that it inspired a few strategy games like
  <em>
   Dawn of War
  </em>
  , but they have also experimented with other formats. One particularly successful example was 2011's
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine
  </em>
  , a story-driven third-person shooter centered around one of the franchise's most iconic factions. Players got to step into the shoes of a marine, Demetrian Titus, and experience his journey through one of the darkest sci-fi universes ever conceived. Fast-forward to 2024, and a sequel is on the horizon
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  , which revisits Titus and his squad as they battle against the invading Tyranids. The games do a lot to develop the Space Marines as people, and putting the player on the front lines instead of commanding from a distance.

 <p>
  However, while they may be one of the most iconic factions, the Space Marines are just a small part of the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe. In the Imperium alone, there are several different factions with their own unique characteristics. Many of these factions could benefit greatly from the S
  <em>
   pace Marine
  </em>
  treatment, and given the new game's hype and potential success, there would certainly be demand for seeing other parts of the franchise take center stage.
  <strong>
   These are other
   <em>
    Warhammer 40k
   </em>
   factions that should get their own shooter.

  <em>
   Space Marine 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  already feature larger-than-life super soldiers. A typical Space Marine stands at around 8 feet tall. It would be hard to imagine the Imperium having something bigger and even more powerful at their disposal, and yet they do. The soldiers of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Adeptus Custodes
   </em>
  </strong>
  easily dwarf most marines. They could be most simply described as paladins who act as a personal guard to the emperor. These space knights are meant to be champions of the Imperium, the best of the best. They fill a few different roles. They can be personal guards to the emperor, keepers of ancient technology (basically
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's Brotherhood of Steel taken up to 11), or people called when a problem is too much for Space Marines to handle.

 <p>
  Given their standing, a game centered around
  <em>
   Adeptus Custodes
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  would be an opportunity to really examine at the core of the Imperium, exploring it at the highest level. This could allow a fun story involving lots of intrigue and political shenanigans while also exploring some of the Empire's darker secrets.

  After the fall of the Aeldar Empire, their species split into three main factions. One of them, and perhaps the closest thing to a "good" faction among them, was the
  <strong>
   Asuryani
  </strong>
  , which strives to preserve their species and fight back against the darkness born out of their empire's collapse. The Asuryani live on massive ships known as
  <strong>
   Craftworlds
  </strong>
  , sort of like
  <em>
   Mass Effect'
  </em>
  's Quarians except even bigger, and scattered to the point where each ship basically has its own unique culture. Just one of these ships could make a really cool setting for a game, given they're described as continent-sized, and the unique worlds of each would allow for a lot of creative freedom. One consistent pattern in each Asuryani Craftworld is the importance of
  <strong>
   choosing a warrior path
  </strong>
  . Each indiividual is expected to learn and dedicate themselves to a specific style of fighting.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  games already have classes, but the theme of choosing a specific path would take it to the next level and push it into RPG territory. Each individual path an Aeldari can choose grants access to different weapons, skills, and sometimes even powers. This would have the advantage of letting players tailor their character towards a preferred playstyle. Some options might allow them to focus more on melee, some can be more gun-driven. They can choose whether to prioritize durability or mobility. Every choice would have its own strengths and weaknesses, which is an exciting proposition.

 <p>
  The Tyranids are already frightening enough, even for a Space Marine equipped with top-quality power armor and weapons, but what if there was a way they could be even scarier?
  <strong>
   Genestealer Cults
  </strong>
  are formed when a heavily populated area is infiltrated by a creature known as a
  <strong>
   Genestealer
  </strong>
  , who will infect locals with Tyranid DNA and brainwash them into seeing it as a messiah. Given enough time, sometimes generations, a cult can gain enough power to hold significant influence, which it will then use to dismantle anything that could potentially complicate a Tyranid invasion, ultimately leaving the world vulnerable to attack. This espionage-based approach adds an extra level of danger to what was already a potentially unstoppable force. There's actually a few different ways a game could approach this.

 <p>
  The obvious approach would be to emphasize stealth and deception. A game centered around a cultist, or even a Genestealer, could emphasize working to quietly advance the cult's interests with various options available, perhaps offering both stealth and combat methods. However, a Genestealer Cult would also make a great antagonist. In this scenario, the game could emphasize stealth and deception from a different perspective, with the player uncovering information about the cult and trying to break them up from the inside. Alternatively, the game could be a straight shooter dealing with a Genestealer Cult in its final stages, with the player having to fight back before the Tyranid invasion force arrives. There are several great options for making a game about this under-recognized faction.

  The
  <strong>
   Necrons
  </strong>
  are an ancient race of immensely powerful machines who could take over the galaxy if they weren't so busy fighting each other. Their tragic story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of pursuing immortality. They were once organic beings who were tricked into shedding their bodies for metallic constructs, a decision they've regretted ever since. There are a lot of directions Necrons could take for gameplay. They have access to some ludicrously powerful weapons, and their mechanical nature could easily lend itself to a class system or options for upgrades and modifications.One particularly unique soldier is the
  <strong>
   Triarch Praetorian
  </strong>
  , a paladin-like warrior equipped with a levitation device and a powerful staff that can tear through enemies.

  A Necron-centered game would have one thing going for it: Necrons are one of the oldest races in the galaxy (at least, of the ones that still exist in some form), predating everyone else by billions of years. Making them the center of a game would allow the narrative to tap into the galaxy's ancient history. There actually is one individual who could be an interesting protagonist: the Silent King
  <strong>
   Szarekh
  </strong>
  , who was responsible for the Necron's current state and fled into exile to repent.

 <p>
  The core philosophy of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  can be summed up as "the universe sucks." It's a cold, hostile galaxy that consistently brings out the worst in people
  <em>
   at best
  </em>
  . Fortunately, there is one race that can lighten the mood: the
  <strong>
   Orks
  </strong>
  . Sure, they are an aggressive warmongering species who wouldn't know the Geneva Convention from a roll of toilet paper, but they're also one of the wackiest factions available. Ork technology is largely made up of
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  -style amalgamations, throwing whatever's available together to create crazy weapons and vehicles. They also literally use lesser Orks (known as snotlings) as ammunition for their bigger weapons.

 <p>
  An Ork game could have some fun deviating from the norm with a
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  -style dark comedy approach. A game like this would have to fully embrace the craziness of
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  's Orks. Allowing absurd weapon customization options and ridiculous vehicles would be a good starting point. They've already had some success with this approach in
  <em>
   Speed Freeks,
  </em>
  but a shooter would need to emphasize over-the-top violence, especially against other factions.

  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  has a history of being very male-dominated. The
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  games focus on a faction that lacks female members entirely (there's a whole thing about how they go through genetic modifications that only work on men. It's still a point of contention among fans). Fortunately, there is one group that would be great for a strong female lead:
  <strong>
   The
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Sisters of Battle
  </strong>
  . This is the military arm of
  <em>
   Adepta Sororitas
  </em>
  , an all-female religious order dedicated to the spreading of the Imperium's state religion. Think something like the Bene Jesserit, except with
  <em>
   a lot more
  </em>
  guns, and you should start to get a clear picture. Their organization has a large arsenal of weapons ranging from pistols to flamethrowers, and even
  <em>
   chainsaw swords
  </em>
  , so there would be a lot of great options for combat. Depending on how complicated the game wanted to get, it could also experiment with power armor customization.

  Story-wise, a game centered around the Sisters of Battle would have to put a lot of focus on one particular aspect - faith. As a religious order, they are driven to a fanatical degree by dedication to their god-emperor and a need to stamp out anyone considered a "heretic." This could actually work in two different ways. One option would be to embrace this aspect, incorporating faith into the gameplay itself and making the story about fighting heresy. The other option would be the opposite — make a story about a sister who is forced to question her faith and use it to explore the atrocities committed by her order.

  A clever
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has injected a dose of stealth into the normally action-focused atmosphere of the game with a new outfit inspired by
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  protagonist Sam Fisher. Designed for use by a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Hunter, the outfit choices are also practical in regular and PVP gameplay, according to their creator.

 <p>
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is notable for having a unique and recognizable visual identity, thanks to the art direction of developer Bungie. However
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's massive selection of armor parts and color shaders allows players to use its versatile customization system to emulate all manner of characters from across the aesthetic spectrum.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  costumes can evoke iconic Bungie characters like Master Chief, as well as answer questions like "What would a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Titan look like as a head of corn?"

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  costume created by LazyLiMy uses the popular
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Superblack color shader as its core, using it on all the armor slots except for the head, which is colored by Gambit Jadestone. The Gambit Jadestone shader is also key, as the glowing green elements of the shader work well with the use of the Wastelander Mask. The mask expertly evokes the iconic visor used by Sam Fisher, which featured night vision scopes with glowing green lenses. LazyLiMy even included an alternative mask choice in the form of the Kit Fox 1.5 mask, which uses a visor with a line-shaped lens.

 <p>
  The costume's torso and arms recreate the low-profile tactical armored look by using the Siegebreak Grips and vest-like Legatus Cuirass, while the Hunter Exotic St0mp-EE5 armor adds a more subtle flair when equipped with the Astrostrides ornament. Finally, the Couturier Clock completes the look, as its hood is kept down, preserving the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  -style outline. Fellow players praised the costume and its creator for its appearance, and also for including recommendations for the player's ship and Ghost Shell, two aspects often ignored by players creating custom outfits. LazyLiMy recommended the premium-priced Alfa-Zulu jumpship for its resemblance to a modern military helicopter, while using the Golf-Tango Ghost Shell for its ability to make the player's Ghost look like an ordinary recon drone.

  While the
  <em>

  series has been dormant for a long time, the popularity of a costume based on it present in an entirely different game shows its enduring influence on players across the gaming public. Ubisoft would do well to keep up progress on its planned
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake, the better to refresh that legacy in players' minds.

  It's been incredible to witness how much the free-to-play multiplayer scene has exploded with online games. Every company is trying to get a piece of this craze and while many titles can bleed together and seem derivative of each other, it's also pushed some developers to challenge the genre and come up with something fun and different.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valorant
   </em>
  </strong>
  made a strong impression on audiences during its beta phase, but it's recently put out its full release and allowed players to see what it's all about.

 <p>
  It's a satisfying tactical first-person shooter, but there are many games out there that conjure a similar vibe.
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  may have a gameplay loop that can be pretty unique in its own right, but that doesn't mean that other titles can't scratch that itch, either. There are several titles in the same vein if players love the gameplay loop of this title, hitting the same notes in some way or the other and letting players enjoy some truly pulse-pounding gameplay that is incredibly tense yet satisfying.

   Competitive shooters continue to evolve as new rivals emerge every year, though not all of them manage to become as popular as Valorant. While Riot Games has truly delivered a one-of-a-kind hero-based shooter with fantastic gunplay, there are of course other options that could share similarities with Valorant in one way or another.

 <p>
  It is difficult to find a game that exactly delivers Valorant's approach to the competitive scene, but some games do have the same core, even though some gameplay mechanics could be different. Hopefully, there is enough thirst for competitive shooters that players will barely run out of options.

  <em>
   Battleborn
  </em>
  was one of the first live-service shooter games to come out that was perfectly serviceable but didn't do anything too major to help it stand out from the rest of the pack. As a result, the player base of this title dwindled to the point where it eventually stopped receiving any support and was quietly taken off the market.

 <p>
  It's a shame since the lack of developments in this genre has made it clear that
  <em>
   Battleborn
  </em>
  did many good things that were pretty underappreciated at the time. Fans have given this game a revival of sorts with

  Aside from its captivating settings and narrative,
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  is also known for its skill-based gunplay, which enables competitive PvP action. The multiplayer mode in
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  evolved with each new entry, even though the campaign had its shortcomings some time. Even
  <em>
   Halo 5: Guardians
  </em>
  , with all the campaign criticisms, excelled in delivering a competitive multiplayer experience.

 <p>
  With
  <em>

  leading the series now, the multiplayer experience has evolved even more. Although the game experienced a rough launch in the beginning, 343 Industries did not give up and the support from
  <em>

  continued to make a top-notch competitive shooter. The game still receives new content and it has a decent player base.

 <p>
  Veterans from DICE banded together to create a live-service shooter that would help the series evolve in a new direction, and
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  doesn't disappoint. The focus on parkour movement coupled with destructive maps makes for a cathartic multiplayer experience that fans can't get enough of.

 <p>
  Sure, the game has some kinks that need to be ironed out, but this is the case for every live-service shooter in its early goings.
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  has settled upon a brilliant formula, and it's up to Embark Studios to ensure that they maintain this hype instead of turning the game into a bloated experience with later updates.

  The idea of playing as space-dwarven miners in extraterrestrial worlds and taking out a wealth of unique enemies sounds like a great time, and this is just one of the many reasons why
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  has become such a massive hit. Fans of
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  who want a different take on this zombie co-op shooter's gameplay will love this title for its great visuals, scintillating combat, and roguelike nature.

 <p>
  No playthrough feels the same, allowing players to have a great time with their friends as they engage in multiple playthroughs to try and complete missions in the most efficient manner possible. There's a fair bit of tactical planning involved in this game that will feel right at home for fans of
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  , but the focus on PvE gameplay means that most players can enjoy the catharsis of violence instead of having to second-guess everything from their movements to the target they're trying to take down.

  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  was a brilliant mix of Soulslike gameplay and third-person shooting that could be incredibly challenging at times. Players had to be very careful about engaging enemies, and playing in co-op was always a plus for players who appreciated the help as they took down enemies and bosses together. So, while fans of the first game were excited to see what
  <strong>
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  had to offer, no one expected the sequel to be such a huge step up from its predecessor.

 <p>
  The roguelike elements from the first game were expanded upon considerably, with the art design and gameplay being simply spectacular. Players couldn't be faulted for just taking a break and appreciating the scenery... that is until a horde of enemies decided to ambush them in the hopes of taking the heroes out in no time flat.
  <em>

  is an excellent game that fans will have a great time with, especially if they love challenging co-op shooters.

  While Destiny 2 is far bigger than a competitive shooter, it does feature a multitude of PvP game modes. Most gamers know Destiny 2 for its incredible raids and dungeons, as well as the story-based missions, but the game does give value to those who have mastered gunplay.

 <p>
  Aside from the classic PvP game modes, Destiny 2 also delivers some special competitive events during each season such as Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner. These events remain active for a limited time, but players who manage to level up and get the objectives done are rewarded with higher-tier PvP weapons.

  Players who love the tactical side of
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  's gameplay will get a ton of mileage out of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Insurgency: Sandstorm
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This game is unlike most other popular squad-based FPS shooters out there, with tactics being key to attaining success. Any player who decides to take matters into their own hands will be shot down faster than they can blink, which speaks volumes when it comes to how tough this game is.

  is a game that everybody loves to parody and criticize now and then. This title, along with

  Regardless of one's personal opinion when it comes to
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , there's no denying that the game is mechanically sound and brilliant at creating engaging scenarios for the player to participate. Each multiplayer session takes a long while but is pretty satisfying when players manage to beat a tough team.

  Call of Duty is probably one of the easiest competitive shooters to enter to. Unlike Valorant or other hero shooters that require the player to know how each hero works and how they can counter their abilities, Call of Duty delivers a simple shooter experience.

 <p>
  Of course, there are still a few things to master in Call of Duty too, such as learning how to move around the map faster, or how to aim better. However, these are just the basics of every competitive shooter. So, at the very least, there is nothing extra to lengthen the learning curve in Call of Duty.

  The fifth game in the popular series, this installment continues the tradition of a gameplay loop that consists of two teams with opposing objectives. Specifically,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Counter-Strike 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  pits a group of terrorists against a team of counter-terrorists. It's available on a variety of platforms and is also free to play.

 <p>
  It is possible to start as a solo player and use the game's matchmaking services to find a team, which will be easy because this is one of the most popular games on the Steam platform. While its launch was met with a somewhat mixed reception, which is understandable considering it updated the most-played game on Steam of the last decade,
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  is largely a positive experience, and it will be around for a long time.

  This FPS is focused on planning and teamwork, and the objectives include environmental destruction and player cooperation. Each player chooses an Operative with unique skills to bring their strengths to the group, and although each character comes with a unique kit of tools and abilities, each one is either an Attacker or Defender.

  In Arena, the developers take the same gunplay but add a more competitive flavor to it. So, instead of exploring the brutal maps and scavenging for valuable loot, players are only tasked with killing each other in Escape From Tarkov Arena on small, close-quarter maps. The good thing about Escape From Tarkov arena is the fact that it uses hero-style characters, and players can unlock them by making progress. Each character comes with a fixed loadout, which makes the entire experience a bit more challenging.

  The game works due to its varied and engaging combat, as well as its seasonal approach that progressively feeds players new content. The battle royale fad isn't in any danger of dying down, but as certain titles fade out of the spotlight, it seems like
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  will remain a major contender with a huge fanbase.

   <em>
    Paladins

  </strong>
  is another free-to-play shooter that’s set in a fantastical land where superpowers and unbelievable weapons are the norm. The gameplay in
  <em>

  isn't that different from its competition, it's a hero shooter that prides itself in the crazy characters that it provides.

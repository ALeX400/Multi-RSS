      <title>Ghost of Yotei May Not Be Exactly 'Ghost of Tsushima 2', But It Doesn't Mean Jin is Done For</title>

 <p>
  There were a lot of exciting announcements at the recent State of Play, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Yotei
   </em>
  </strong>
  definitely stole the show. News of a sequel to
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  has been long-awaited, but
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  took many by surprise. Not only is the game set over 300 years after the events of its predecessor, but it's introducing a brand-new protagonist.

  Atsu, a female Ronin, takes the stage as
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's lead. It was both a shocking and thrilling revelation, but there has also been sadness in regard to Jin Sakai being taken out of the picture. Much of the speculation surrounding a sequel predicted that a follow-up would revolve around the second Mongol invasion of Japan that happened only a few years after the first. Sucker Punch making the bold decision to make the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  franchise more of an anthology is ultimately a stronger move, but that doesn't mean Jin Sakai is completely gone as a character.

  Bringing a New Meaning to the Ghost of Tsushima Name
 </h3>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  taking place 300 years after its predecessor, Jin is clearly dead. However, this doesn't mean he can't live on in some capacity. Jin's story and the events of
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  have likely become legends that are passed down from generation to generation, making Jin a folk hero. He can still live on through stories, and this presents plenty of opportunities for the character to be mentioned and hinted at during various points in
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's story.

 <p>
  Whether it be through interactions with descendants or writings found throughout the game, Jin can still be an important presence, even if he is not physically there. Showcasing a new region and era of Japan is an intriguing change, and it could be fascinating to see how Jin's story has evolved through word-of-mouth storytelling. Despite many decades passing since
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , Jin's efforts to push back the Mongols wouldn't be forgotten. There is even the possibility that Atsu could potentially be a descendant of Jin. Since the announcement of the sequel is fresh, there is barely anything known about the character, but being part of Jin's lineage isn't off the table.

 <p>
  It would also be a beautiful way to pay homage to the franchise's "ghost" title if Jin were to subtly haunt the story in some small way. A Sucker Punch dev has hinted that
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  may be the first of many spin-off stories. Creating a chain reaction of each preceding protagonist touching the story in an unexpected way may be a smart way to make the games feel connected while also standing on their own.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tshusima

  and
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  setting the stage for a new ongoing PlayStation franchise shows that Sucker Punch isn't afraid to take risks, and that's exciting. The developer could have easily gone the expected route and featured the second Mongol invasion, but it chose fresh storytelling over the clear path forward. Although
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's appearance matches its predecessor, it's clear that the game also aims to be its own special stand-alone story.

 <p>
  Despite controversy surrounding
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's new protagonist, Atsu and her story are promising another beautiful and violent adventure on the horizon. Sucker Punch has shocked many with this change of direction, and it could pay off in spades if the story is on par, or even better, than its predecessor. Jin may be physically long gone, but his spirit will likely still be present.

  While exploring the cities in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players will come across peculiar entities, such as Officer Mewmew, whose identity is still a mystery, and the
  <strong>
   Sage in a Barrel
  </strong>
  , which is even more absurd than the large white cat. Kicking this trash can will cause the Sage in a Barrel to request some
  <strong>
   HIA Commemorative Coins in
   <em>
    ZZZ
   </em>
  </strong>
  . There are several types of this item, and the Sage will request different types based on where players are interacting with the trash can.

  's procedural map generation, that can be tricky. But don't worry; this guide narrows down the location of this ring to two possible locations in the Agronomy Sector in N'erud. Players looking for this powerful accessory should start
  <em>
   The Dark Horizon

  one-shot adventure, then pick up this guide from there.

  of the

  Agronomy Sector map, players should go north until they find a fork. Then, they should choose the path leading further north and pick up the first drone that will pop up from the platform.

  If players direct the

  toward the hot air stream that's in front, they'll be propelled upward, to a platform located one level above the ledge. This platform will be big enough to have two of those big orange lamps illuminating the crops, and one

  will be patrolling the area. Defeat the Harvester, climb the ledge on the left side, and then an

  This elite enemy can be a little tricky to deal with, so equipping a resilient melee build with a tank Archetype can help players with the non-stop blows they'll receive from this beast. It doesn't have too much health, so a couple of primary weapon magazines unloaded in its weak point (the shiny orange thing in its head) will do the trick.

     While the Black Greatsword was added to the game alongside the release of The Dark Horizon DLC, some players report that they have been able to obtain the weapon without purchasing the DLC. As such, the Black Greatsword may not be a DLC-exclusive weapon, and it could instead be part of the free update that added

  The Extra tier of the
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  subscription service has been updated to include
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 1
  </em>
  , the PS5 remake of one of the best PlayStation games ever made. PlayStation Plus Extra is the middle tier of Sony's subscription service. With it, subscribers can claim the monthly free PS Plus games, as well as try all the titles added to the Games Catalog.

 <p>
  The PS Plus Games Catalog is a collection of PS4 and PS5 games that are available on a rotating basis. Some of the best games ever released for either platform are readily available to play through PS Plus Extra, and so for many PlayStation gamers, the subscription is really a no-brainer. Yet another game has been added to the PS Plus Extra lineup, giving gamers even more reason to sign up.

  To celebrate The Last of Us Day, PlayStation has added
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 1
  </em>
  to PS Plus Extra.
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 1
  </em>
  is the PS5 remake of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , Naughty Dog's critically-acclaimed action-adventure/survival-horror game that originally released on the PS3 in 2013.
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 1
  </em>
  vastly improves the game's graphics to match modern standards and takes advantage of new features like the DualSense's adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. It's the best way to experience the story of the original
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  game nowadays, and now PS Plus Extra subscribers can do just that without paying more than what they already do with their subscription.

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dino Crisis
  </em>
  are coming to PS Plus Premium at some piont in the near future.

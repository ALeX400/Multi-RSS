  The New York Times’
  <em>
   <strong>
    Strands
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an exciting word search puzzle game with a fun twist. It challenges players to find hidden words within a grid of jumbled letters. The twist lies in the unique way words can be formed: they can be connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and even change direction mid-word.

  The ultimate goal in
  <em>
   Strands

  is to discover a special word or phrase, known as the
  <strong>
   spangram
  </strong>
  , that connects all the theme words and spans across the entire grid. If you’re struggling with today’s

      <title>Overwatch 2's 5v5 Format Will Likely Be Put Through its Paces in December</title>

   <em>

  </strong>
  's visuals and gameplay aren't much of a giant leap from its predecessor's. However, the sequel does deliver some significant changes, with the most polarizing one being the switch from 6v6 to 5v5. Some players liked this new format's faster match queues and gameplay. However, others felt that the change, which cut down the number of tank players from two to one, took away some of the game's complexity. The 5v5 format has been the default mode to play competitive
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  for the past two years, backed by countless hero and map patches to accommodate it. It seems like it will be put through its paces towards the end of 2024, depending on how the
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  's Season 14 6v6 tests fare among fans.

  Blizzard's premier hero shooter has been mulling over the possibility of returning 6v6 as a mainstay game mode since mid-2024. Director Aaron Keller discussed the format's history, the switch to 5v5 for
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  , and the possibility of 6v6's return in a comprehensive blog article published on July 25. The director's, and players', speculations may soon come to fruition in Season 14, according to Keller's latest post.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  will roll out two test modes using the 6v6 format and developers will also lay down some big balance changes that apply exclusively to these modes.

 <h3 id="the-case-for-6v6-rsquo-s-competitive-comeback">
  The Case for 6v6’s Competitive Comeback
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are a few advantages of 6v6, with the most obvious one being the return to the classic
  <em>
   OW
  </em>
  experience. Players can relive the glory of the original dive comp with Winston and D.Va again. There’s also the Reinhardt and Zarya combo that veteran players love, as the pair can tank a ton of damage for their team by playing around each other’s shields.

 <p>
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  ’s 6v6 format also avoids the pitfalls of its predecessor when it comes to having multiple tanks in one team. Since both test modes require at least one hero for every role, pulling off a full-fledged GOATS comp is impossible. Only time will tell if a Ramattra and Sigma double-shield team will slow down the game like Sigma and Orisa did back then. However, this possibility is something that the 6v6 balance patches could address, as Keller stated that they will essentially tune down the survivability and power of tanks for the two test modes.

 <h3 id="why-5v5-should-stay-in-overwatch-2">
  Why 5v5 Should Stay in Overwatch 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  The 5v5 format is working well for
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  , as it solves some of the issues that plagued the old format. For one, it accelerated queue times, as there were two fewer players to consider when creating a match. It also makes for faster-paced games, as there are fewer chances to stall with just one tank compared to the two that
  <em>
   OW1
  </em>
  had. Another advantage it has is that years of hero and map patches are already in place to accommodate this format, so players who prefer a consistent and stable meta have cause to want
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's 5v5 mode to stay.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":973} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The 6v6 renaissance is in full swing, with the upcoming hero shooter
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  also adopting the format. Its impending launch and
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  ’s Season 14 test in December will likely overshadow
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  's 5v5 format.
  <em>
  </em>
  However, the latest Director’s Take post also discusses the possibility of the two modes coexisting permanently. Either way, shifting to 6v6 or making both formats accessible will definitely be an interesting shakeup for the game’s casual and pro scene.

  One of the first characters to officially join Rook's group in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Neve Gallus, is a powerful investigator and mage. As a user of ice spells, the companion excels at assisting the protagonist during combat, offering not only damage but also crowd control to manage enemies during battles.

 <p>
  Therefore, Neve's best abilities in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  are those that enhance her strengths. When combined with a good character composition, they allow her to shine even more in combat. Players should progress by choosing what best fits the group's needs at the moment.

 <p>
  Neve can deal area damage with the spell Blizzard, conjuring an ice vortex that hits all enemies within that circle. Although it doesn't cause a burst of damage like some of her other spells, it's an excellent ability for handling multiple enemies during combat.

 <p>
  Players can also choose the Greater Passive Flash Freeze to further enhance the spell's capability. While it doesn't increase the attack's damage per se, it
  <strong>
   freezes all enemies affected by the ability.
  </strong>
  This prevents them from escaping the received damage and provides an opening for Rook and other companions to attack.

  One of the mechanics players need to deal with in combat is the armor or barrier that some powerful enemies have, which reduces incoming damage until broken. Fortunately, Neve has an ability in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  that can help simplify fighting these opponents.

 <p>
  Chill Out is a passive that, when chosen,
  <strong>
   makes the spell Icebreaker deal extra damage to all barriers
  </strong>
  , the blue HP bars. This is an excellent way to speed up combat, as it helps characters start dealing real damage to opponents earlier, making it a strategic choice.

 <p>
  Neve is an excellent option for combating enemies with magical protection on their HP, because two of her main abilities can be upgraded to
  <strong>
   deal more damage to those fortified foes
  </strong>
  . In the case of Glacial Pace, this is achieved through the skill Barrier Buster.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1026} -->

 <p>
  Thus, Neve becomes a prime candidate during moments when dealing with such enemies is necessary. Additionally, it's important for Neve to have two abilities with extra damage to barriers, as she can combine her spells with those of other characters to perform powerful combos.

 <p>
  Although not exclusive to Neve, Time Stop is one of the most interesting abilities in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
  </em>
  It
  <strong>
   reduces the speed of everything around Rook during combat,
  </strong>
  except the protagonist himself. This gives the character ample time to deal significant damage to enemies without the risk of counterattack.

 <p>
  It's also possible to further improve this ability through skills like Windfall. This passive doesn't provide any benefits during the spell's effect, but grants a bonus to Rook's Rage once time returns to normal. This allows combat to resume with the protagonist ready to use additional abilities.

 <p>
  By making certain choices during Neve's progression, the spell Icebreaker can become even more powerful, offering not only damage, but also crowd control effects against enemies. An excellent ability option for her in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is the passive Deep Freeze.

 <p>
  With this ability, whenever Neve lands a critical hit, the enemy, in addition to the damage and other conditions received, will also be
  <strong>
   inflicted with the Frozen status.
  </strong>
  Players can then exploit this opportunity to deal more damage without concern or eliminate other targets first.

 <p>
  Combat in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  can be somewhat complicated, especially as players get accustomed to it, mainly because they will need to control companions' abilities. Fortunately, some companions like Neve have an upgrade that enables them to automatically cast certain abilities.

 <p>
  Cold Front is an essential choice for virtually all of her builds in the game, as it
  <strong>
   allows her to cast Glacial Pace without instructions,
  </strong>
  making fights easier. This passive can be obtained early in the game, not only enhancing her combat power but also making the overall experience more satisfying.

  Freezing Point is essential for maximizing Neve Gallus's crowd control in

  . By upgrading Glacial Pace with this ability, Neve
  <strong>
   applies the Frozen status to enemies hit,

  immobilizing them immediately. This allows Rook and other companions to seize the opportunity to attack without resistance.

  In addition to dealing damage, Freezing Point dominates the battlefield by neutralizing multiple adversaries simultaneously. The Frozen status prevents enemies from performing offensive or defensive actions, reducing pressure on the team. This strategic enhancement is indispensable for players seeking a tactical advantage in challenging combats.

  Shattered Resolve boosts Neve's effectiveness when synergizing with allies who apply the Sundered status, like Rook or other companions. By upgrading Icebreaker with this ability, Neve can trigger powerful combos,
  <strong>
   causing additional Stagger on affected enemies.
  </strong>
  This is crucial for breaking adversaries' defenses and creating openings for lethal attacks.

 <p>
  When an enemy is under the effect of Sundered, Shattered Resolve amplifies the impact of Icebreaker, making them even more vulnerable. This combination allows the protagonist to unleash finishing attacks more easily, especially if the opponent's HP is low. This ability is indispensable for players aiming to maximize team damage and conclude combat swiftly.

  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment

  .

  Excitement for
  <em>
   Gears of War E-Day
  </em>
  has been at a high ever since it was first revealed at the end of the Xbox Games Showcase in June. After the game’s first reveal back in June, Microsoft saw a huge surge in gamers heading back into the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  universe, thanks in part to its availability on Game Pass. It was
  <em>
   Gears of War Ultimate Edition,
  </em>
  a remake of the first game that saw the biggest jump in player count.

  While the casting news was to be expected, fans will no doubt be happy to hear that the original actors will be reprising their roles, although some gamers would have preferred a look at gameplay. Apart from the reveal trailer and the few tidbits of information that set the story, little else is known about the game; the status of
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  multiplayer is even up in the air. While it's likely multiplayer modes will return, The Coalition's Creative Director Matt Searcy gave a vague response when asked about its inclusion.

 <p>
  Fans will no doubt be happy to get hold of the third-person shooter when it eventually releases. There are rumors that
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  could be released in 2025, and it will appear on PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles. It must be said that Xbox’s 2025 slate is already filling up with shooters such as
  <em>
   Perfect Dark
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom Dark Ages
  </em>
  .
  <em>
  </em>
  Adding Activision’s annual
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  entry into the mix could mean gamers have to wait until 2026 to see Marcus and Dom reunite.

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard: Solas’ Most Trusted General Explained</title>

   This article contains story spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard and The Masked Empire.
  </span>
  Solas's memories make up a large part of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  and offer valuable insight into his past. A recurring figure in his memories that Rook sees is Felassan, whose name means "slow arrow" in the elven language. Felassan was one of Solas's most trusted generals. Notes and diary entries written by Felassan can also be found across
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  in the Lighthouse and the Crossroads, and one of the revenants to be defeated is a manifestation of Solas' regret in the form of Felassan.

 <p>
  Despite his first in-game appearance being in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , Felassan has played a part in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  saga before as an Agent of Fen'Harel and was active in Orlais several months before the events of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . He was killed by Solas, but
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  goes deeper into depicting their relationship and how they worked together during Solas' rebellion against the Evanuris.

  Felassan made his first appearance in
  <em>
   The Masked Empire
  </em>
  , a novel written by
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's lead writer, Trick Weekes, and published in 2014. Felassan was mentioned in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  's DLC
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  in Cole's dialogue, where Cole says, "His friend had to die. Because he thought they were people. A slow arrow breaks in the sad wolf's jaws," which confirms that Solas was indeed the mysterious figure who killed Felassan at the conclusion of
  <em>
   The Masked Empire
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  As depicted in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , Felassan is an ancient elf who was one of Solas's most loyal supporters. In
  <em>
   The Masked Empire
  </em>
  , he plays the role of Briala's mentor and is a major figure in the book's events. He's described as having Mythal's vallaslin, despite not identifying as Dalish, and tells Briala several stories about the Dread Wolf. Over the course of
  <em>
   The Masked Empire
  </em>
  , it becomes clear that Felassan has knowledge beyond what any modern elf would have, and the conclusion of the book confirms that he is an ancient elf. The eluvians are a major feature of
  <em>
   The Masked Empire
  </em>
  , and Briala manages to secure the password to the local eluvian network.

  It's later revealed that Felassan was working for a greater being, and was tasked with procuring the passcode for the eluvians. Because of his experiences with Briala, and his affection for the people of Thedas, he chooses to defy Solas' orders and refuses to give him access to the network. In response, Solas kills one of his most trusted agents and allies.

 <p>
  Solas's decision to kill Felassan is made all the more heartbreaking after seeing them fight against the Evanuris together. Felassan's loyalty to Solas even after thousands of years later, and only choosing to defy him because of his convictions, speaks to the strength of his character and morality. The fact that Felassan forms a massive part of Solas's regret, so much so that it manifested as a powerful revenant in the Crossroads, implies that Solas dwelt on the deterioration of their relationship, and his own action against his old friend.

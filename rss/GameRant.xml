      <title>Switch 2’s Latest Launch Window Rumors Explained</title>

  Ever since Nintendo acknowledged its existence back in May 2024, the successor to the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  , often called the Switch 2 by fans, has been shrouded in mystery. Only three things have been officially confirmed about the elusive next-gen console so far: it will be backwards compatible with the current Switch, have Nintendo Switch Online functionality, and be announced sometime between now and March 2025. Even though the Switch 2 is supposedly only a few months away from being revealed, one may think, given how silent Nintendo has been on the matter, that it isn't going to be shown off anytime soon.

  While Nintendo has given a broad idea of when the Switch 2 will be unveiled, it hasn't provided any hints about its release date. For a while, many fans believed that the upcoming system would be announced in late 2024 and launched in the first half of 2025. Now that the year is almost over, however, this outcome seems less and less likely. Most industry pundits currently surmise that the Switch 2 will be revealed early next year and, as a result, may not hit store shelves until mid-to-late 2025. Having to wait an entire year for the Switch's successor to be released would be incredibly disappointing, but fortunately, this may not be the case. According to a new rumor, Nintendo may launch its next console far earlier than some may expect.

  A New Rumor Suggests That the Switch 2 Will Come Out in the First Quarter of 2025
 </h3>
 <p>
  Stephen Georg, a long-time streamer on YouTube and Twitch, recently made some comments on Twitter that caught the attention of many Nintendo fans. On November 22, Georg tweeted out that he had received an e-mail from a developer about an upcoming game, which apparently included a line that hinted at a potential release window for the Switch 2. According to Georg, the e-mail said that the unspecified game would be released in "Q1 2025 on PC (Steam), Xbox One &amp; Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch(es)!" The fact that the statement used the term "Nintendo Switch" in plural form and not singular, Georg suggested, was a sign that it was referring to the Switch 2.

 <p>
  If the game this e-mail is alluding to does come out on the Switch 2 the same day it launches on other platforms, then that indicates that the console will be released within the first three months of 2025. This, assuming it's true, means that the marketing cycle for Nintendo's next-gen system is going to be very short, which is quite unusual. Consoles are typically announced several months before their initial debuts. The original Nintendo Switch was revealed around 5 months ahead of its launch, while the Xbox Series X/S was unveiled nearly a year before its worldwide release.

  The Switch 2 Being Released in Early 2025 Seems Unlikely, But It's Not Out of the Question
 </h3>
 <p>
  Normally, it wouldn't make sense at all for a company to launch a console with only a few months of pre-release marketing. In the case of the Switch 2, however, it may not be that unreasonable. Unless some unexpected circumstances arise, Nintendo's next system is pretty much guaranteed to be a hit. The current Nintendo Switch is one of the best-selling consoles of all time, so it's likely that its follow-up will be at least somewhat successful. Because of this, it's possible that Nintendo thinks the Switch 2 doesn't need a massive marketing campaign and believes it is okay to release the system only two to three months after it's formally announced.

 <p>
  While the idea of Nintendo releasing its next console in the first quarter of 2025 seems pretty far-fetched, it's not outside the realm of possibility. Even still, it's important to keep in mind that Stephen Georg's claims about the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  's successor have not been corroborated by reputable insiders just yet, so it's best to take them with a large grain of salt.

  A simple challenge between
  <em>
   <strong>
    Half-Life 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  developers led to the creation of the game's Gnome Chompski prop and its associated achievement, a Valve employee has revealed. Aside from
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  , the infamous garden gnome has appeared in other Valve titles as well.

 <p>
  To mark the 20th anniversary of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  on November 16, Valve released a massive update for the legendary shooter that introduced Steam Workshop support, improved visuals, and some fixes, among other things. The major content drop also included a developer commentary, which is a feature that became a staple in Valve titles only after the launch of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  . An interesting detail that was mentioned in these developer diaries was the origin of Gnome Chompski, a garden gnome prop in
  <em>
   Episode Two
  </em>
  that is crucial to unlocking the game's Little Rocket Man achievement.

 <p>
  In a commentary bubble that can be found midway through
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  's first level, Point Insertion, Valve designer Scott Dalton revealed that Gnome Chompski, seemingly a reference to popular American linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, could trace its history to a silly little challenge between the game’s developers. Testers would put a small baby doll in a blue crate at the start of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  and carry it as far as they could throughout the title in an effort to make trial runs more fun, according to Dalton. This supposedly ended up inspiring Little Rocket Man, the difficult
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  achievement that tasks players with carrying Gnome Chompski for most of
  <em>
   Episode Two
  </em>
  and placing it inside a rocket near the very end.

  Valve's critically-acclaimed

  The development of

  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  was announced back in 2021, and it took time for the game to make it to market. This free-to-play title takes the typical hero shooter formula and injects it with familiar sights and sounds from a galaxy far, far away. Upon release, the game was met with mixed critical reception, garnering an average score of 60 on OpenCritic. Despite this, it hasn't deterred developer Zynga from continuing to update
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  with new seasonal content, keeping things fresh for returning players.

  It was revealed in an official blog post that
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  is coming to PC in 2025. The PC version is set to come with improvements, including "visually enhanced battlefields." The trailer includes side-by-side comparisons between previous versions and the PC edition, and the difference is surprisingly stark. The lighting effects make a huge difference in helping make the maps of
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  look much more vivid. According to the blog post, keyboard, mouse, and wireless control support will be added to the game, as well as the ability to rebind keys.

  With
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  coming to PC next year, it could be a good time to dive into the other versions to get familiar with its mechanics. Just recently,
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  revealed its Season 4 plans, with new characters and game modes coming to the free-to-play hero shooter. Season 4 is set to run until late January 2025, which will coincide with the release of
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  on PC. Nothing is confirmed yet, but it's a safe bet to assume that the PC launch may also see the launch of Season 5.

      <title>Larian Studios Profit After Releasing Baldur's Gate 3 Revealed</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3-profit/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  was easily one of the biggest games of 2023, and as a result of its roaring success, Larian Studios posted a profit of €249 million, with a revenue of €427 million. As the Game of the Year in 2023,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  enjoyed accolades from critics and players alike. It succeeded in living up to the vast legacy of the
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  franchise, and it rejuvenated mainstream interest in the CRPG genre.

 <p>
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  continues to grow in popularity even a year after launch, but its success has been difficult to measure in numbers alone. Over most weekends, it sees around 100,000 concurrent players enjoying an adventure on the Sword Coast – which is beyond impressive for a single-player game this far after its release. In terms of sales, recent information estimates that
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  sold over 15 million copies across all three platforms.

 <p>
  However, the holding company for Larian Studios based in Dublin, Ireland, confirmed the profit and revenue that
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  accrued in 2023 – shared via the Irish Independent. Namely, Larian's pre-tax profit for 2023 ended up being €249 million (approximately $260.9 million), while its revenue was €427 million (approximately $447.5 million). Despite its major success,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  will not have any DLCs or sequels made by Larian Studios, as the developers parted ways with Wizards of the Coast shortly after the release of the game.

  It's safe to say that
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  have plenty in common, as both games became cultural touchstones of their respective eras. More importantly,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  enjoys enduring popularity despite being a single-player title, propped up by impressive replayability and a thriving modding community. While
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  was ridiculously profitable for Larian Studios in 2023, the company posted a loss in profits the year prior. In 2022, Larian lost €214,000 (approximately $224,100), while only having €22.7 million (approximately $23.7 million) in total revenue.

 <p>
  It should be noted that, prior to
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , the last title that Larian Studios released was in 2017. In many ways,
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  was the blueprint for how Larian adapted the Fifth Edition in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , but much like its successor, it was designed as a single-player experience with no monetization. Larian was prepared to take a loss in 2022, and it's safe to say that the company's gamble paid off. While it remains to be seen what comes next for Larian Studios, the developers left quite the mark with
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  .

  A new rumor indicates that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  could be using procedural generation during its development and may be coming to PC after all.
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  is the most eagerly awaited game of 2025, and fans have been clinging to essentially any rumor about its development, while Rockstar has still not released the second official trailer for the upcoming open-world action game.

 <p>
  Last year, Rockstar unveiled the first official
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  trailer, offering gamers a glimpse of what the game would be and presenting its protagonists, Lucia and Jason. The
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  trailer was a huge hit, with over 220 million fans watching it. Unfortunately, news about the title has been scarce since then.

 <p>
  Now, a gamer has discovered the LinkedIn profile of a Principal Engine Programmer who has been working at Rockstar since 2020 and has
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  listed as the only project they’re working on. In the post, the developer lists out some of the work they have done, which included working with Rockstar’s in-house engine, RAGE, to develop the game for both consoles and PC.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  has not been confirmed for PC, but this indicates that it may eventually be released on the platform. The post also says that the developer has worked with ray tracing, and “procedural generation for objects and game environments.”

 <p>
  These details hint that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could have used procedural generation to create its vast open world. That’s not surprising, considering that most large games utilize it in some manner, and populating the world with trees, grass, and small objects is a greatly time-consuming procedure. In any case, considering how handcrafted Rockstar’s worlds often are, it’s unlikely that the feature will be used to create large chunks of the game. Obviously, the information on this LinkedIn profile does not guarantee that any of these features will be in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  when it’s finally released in 2025, so it’s worth taking the rumor with a grain of salt unless Rockstar confirms it.

 <p>
  Another recent
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  rumor indicates that the next trailer will come out soon. According to some gamers, it’s possible that Rockstar will follow the same pattern as last year, releasing the new trailer one week before the December update for
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  . This would put the trailer’s release on December 3, 2024. However, it’s impossible to predict the exact date, so fans will have to wait until the official announcement to know for sure.

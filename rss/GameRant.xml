  The Wish Carnival Party is the theme for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Infinity Nikki
   </strong>
  </em>
  1.4. Players can join the Faewish Sprites' celebration at the Floating Wish Isle, where everyone can dance, have fun, and make friends with the Faewish Sprites.

  After unraveling the chaos behind the evil-yet-good Carnival Mask, Stylists will get additions to their Carnival in Frames album. However, unlike previous photo events where players simply must do quests to fill the book, the
  <strong>
   Carnival in Frames event in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  also demands miscellaneous things for some pictures to appear.

  After capturing at least 10 Faewish Sprites dancing in lines at the Floating Wish Isle, add the photo to the event by
  <strong>
   pressing the upload button right after taking the picture
  </strong>
  . Without pressing the upload option, the photo won't appear, so make sure to do this
  <strong>
   right after snapping the photo
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are the steps to complete this task:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Head to the Floating Wish Isle, located southeast of the Wish Pass Office Warp Spire in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
   . The Warp Spire itself is available south of Wishing Woods, or to the far east of Florawish. On the map, players will see a large circular isle colored in gray.
  </li>
  <li>
   Open the photo mode in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
   and take the Faewish Sprites inside the frame, which will be indicated by golden squares.
  </li>
  <li>
   After capturing the picture, press the upload button to add it to the Carnival in Frames event book.
  </li>

  <li>
   Enter an Illusion Zone and

   Before leaving the zone, take a picture of the one wearing the mask, then upload it.

 <p>
  Survival games generally place the player into a harsh, dangerous environment, requiring them to find a way to thrive and survive. This usually means exploring, finding resources, crafting weapons, clothing and equipment, and some form of shelter. These are the staples of survival games, but some offer other types of content as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dungeon crawling is a feature of some survival games. Sometimes traditional dungeons, other times dungeon-like caves or underground structures. Often, these dungeons are used as a way to gate valuable resources, or to hide valuable, powerful items. These dungeons provide players with a way to test their skills, and have some fun exploring and defeating enemies, often tough bosses.

  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  is a multiplayer, sandbox survival game. However, it is not a full-blown MMORPG. It is set in a game world that is based on the lore of Conan the Barbarian, filled with mythical beasts to conquer and valuable resources to accrue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The multiplayer feature makes
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  stand out, as players can group together to build entire settlements if they wish, and of course, to tackle the dangerous dungeons. Dungeons can be found in most biomes, and offer a significant challenge to players who are either not ready to tackle them, or lack the proper equipment.

  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  is another open-world, sandbox survival game. It is based on elements from Norse mythology.
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  follows an interesting progression mechanic, with players needing to defeat a number of bosses in turn, to gain access to the next tier of resources and materials. Dungeons are not just about fun combat in Valheim; they are a requirement to progress through the game. Some resources, such as iron, can only be found in dungeons, so every player will need to tackle them eventually.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trick with
  <em>
   Valheim’s
  </em>
  dungeons is not to try them until geared up sufficiently, especially the dungeons that feature archer enemies. These dungeons include Burial Chambers, filled with skeletons and Surtling Cores, Sunken Crypts in the Swamps, where iron scrap is hidden behind muddy scrap piles, and Frost Caves in the Mountains, where werewolves and cultists lurk. Each dungeon has unique enemies, hazards, and treasures, making exploration a thrilling yet dangerous necessity.

   In Ark: Survival Evolved

  , the player inhabits a prehistoric world, populated by dinosaurs and other mythical creatures. The game offers an open-world, sandbox style of gameplay, with a focus on taming and even riding dinosaurs, alongside traditional survival tropes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cave dungeons in
  <em>
   Ark: Survival Evolved

  are the best places to find legendary artifacts. However, they are, of course, the place where the most powerful enemies are found in the game as well. They are also the locations where players can summon the toughest bosses in the game.

  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  is a very successful 2d indie game, that combines survival with exploration, combat, and crafting. The game has been heavily influenced by RPGs, with a very similar progression system that RPG fans will recognize. The dungeons in
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  are dangerous for many reasons, including the intricate traps, and many hidden, secret areas, all generated procedurally. The boss battles require some strategic thinking to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then there are the two mega-dungeons, including the famed Underworld, a huge cavern that players need to explore and survive in. And, of course, the Dungeon itself; a sprawling, perilous fortress teeming with traps and guarded by Skeletron, with formidable foes like Cursed Skulls and Dark Casters lurking within. Later in the adventure, the Lihzahrd Temple presents yet another ruthless ordeal, housing the mighty Golem and packed with lethal Lihzahrds and spiked hazards.

 <p>
  The dungeons in
  <em>
   Don’t Starve Together
  </em>
  are huge cave systems, that are completely unpredictable. They are grueling at times, and offer a significant challenge even to experienced players. But with good preparation and teamwork, they can be beaten, but never easily. These caves include dangerous biomes like the Spore-laden Mushtree Forests and the deadly Ruins, home to powerful creatures such as Depths Worms and Ancient Guardians. The Ruins, in particular, hold valuable loot like Thulecite and the powerful Ancient Pseudoscience Station, making them a high-risk, high-reward destination. Players must navigate darkness, hunger, and aggressive enemies to survive in these treacherous underground landscapes.

  If you're able to get inside the tower, you'll find a note that reveals that the keycard is in an old military bunker called the

  This note will also tell you that the only way in is through a hidden entrance close to some nearby greenhouses.
  <strong>
   This entrance is located at 43.4 E, 74.6 N on the map.

  It'll look like a
  <strong>
   rusty metal door with the words "Access L1"

 <p>
  While the enemy faction you'll run into the most in Skethermoor is The Protocol, this bunker is surprisingly populated by outlaws like the ones from Slatten Dale. It's easier to explore this bunker if all the outlaws are dead, so you can silently take them down or go in guns blazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the doors on the left side of the bunker will be barred from the other side, but there will be
  <strong>
   one door that can be opened that will have a window next to it.
  </strong>
  Enter that room and be prepared to fight with a horde of poisonous rats. Use a melee weapon or an explosive lure to get rid of them. There will be a rat's nest in this room that you can destroy to prevent any more rats from spawning. There will be an
  <strong>
   open passage in the wall
  </strong>
  with red light pouring out of it. Head through that and then climb up some crates to reach a platform where there will be another
  <strong>
   passage that you can crawl through.
  </strong>
  This will lead you inside of an office.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Go upstairs and the
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Skethermoor Radio Tower Keycard will be sitting on a desk.

  Loot the rest of the items in this room and then exit the Vehicle Storage Bunker.

    <p>
     Before leaving the bunker, there's a room with double doors on the right side of the room. It'll be locked and require the Vehicle Bunker Storeroom Key to open. This can be found in the first room on the left sitting on a bed. You can then open up the storeroom to score a stock-level Lee No.4 rifle, an Atomic Battery, and some other items. Just be wary of the busted Atomic Batteries in this room that will be leaking deadly radiation.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Return to the radio tower and use the keycard. You'll either get a message from Joyce or you'll hear a different message if this is the last tower you've activated. Either way, that's Skethermoor's radio tower taken care of.

  Creative thinking and innovation are at the heart of all great
  <strong>
   city-builders
  </strong>
  . It is the foresight to envision a mass metropolis and see it all come to fruition a hundred hours or so later. The genre, however, has traditionally depended on grid-based building, which confines structures to rigid squares or rectangles and can often stifle that much-needed prerequisite of imagination. Nevertheless, a growing number of city-builders have embraced
  <strong>
   gridless mechanics,
  </strong>
  allowing for more organic methods of city planning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Gridless city-builders
  </strong>
  remove the restrictions, supplying players with the means to shape their settlements how they see fit, fitting them with sprawling town centers, winding roads, and uniquely shaped districts. The end result is an immersive and dynamic experience where cities evolve in response to player preferences.
  <strong>
   These games are high-quality examples of city-builders that chose to employ a gridless form of building.

   <em>
    The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  comes from a long line of city-builder royalty. For a game released in 2010, it features some positively freeing building mechanics. It allows players to drop buildings anywhere within the player-controlled territory, unburdened by the constraints of the grid that many city-builders used at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the game has certainly come to show its age and predominantly follows more of an RTS dynamic, enshrouded in a steep learning curve (which may bottleneck the creativity of a city-builder player), it still offers some engaging gameplay that is not found in many other strategy games. Ultimately, while it doesn't fully explore the potential of a gridless building system,
  <em>
   The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom
  </em>
  offers some enjoyable creation tools for crafting visually appealing cities in an RTS landscape.

  Although
  <strong>
   <em>
    Planetbase
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not offer the most fluid building system or the most visually appealing designs, it still supplies a sense of wonder by enabling players to create a self-sustaining colony on a distant planet in whatever way they imagine. The building process involves placing prefabricated structures anywhere the player wishes and then connecting them to existing structures with tunnels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of land to build on, hindered by the set maps and the rocks and mountains surrounding it. This can sometimes create a sense of rigidity in building, making it feel less open compared to other titles in the genre, particularly the more expansive
  <em>
   Surviving Mars
  </em>
  . Still, for a relatively relaxing colony space builder that challenges creativity in a hostile environment,
  <em>
   Planetbase
  </em>
  is worth a playthrough.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Land of the Vikings
   </em>
  </strong>
  presents an excellent opportunity for those looking to create a thriving Norse community in intricate detail from the ground up. Without a grid restricting the placement of Viking longhouses in symmetrical spaces, this game allows players to position buildings anywhere on the map, enabling them to construct their Viking village according to their vision. To support this creative endeavor, the buildings are designed with a strong commitment to historical accuracy, reflecting the traditional Viking architecture that many will recognize.
 </p>
 <p>
  One key feature that deserves significant praise is the in-game building editor, which offers players the chance to customize an unlimited number of buildings or decorations. These designs can then be used in any desired location within the game, further reinforcing the flexibility of the game's gridless focus. Once a village is finished and the journey from humble wooden huts to bustling market town is complete,
  <em>
   Land of the Vikings
  </em>
  places itself as a distinctive creative experience.

  Certainly the most original entry on this list, and one that may diverge from the essence of a typical city-builder,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles
   </em>
  </strong>
  , challenges players to construct a thriving community in the most hostile of terrains. A loose sequel to
  <em>
   The Falconeer
  </em>
  , the inhabitants of The Great Ursee universe build densely packed towers bolted to the sides of cliffs, interconnected by a complex web of rickety walkways and bridges, all surrounded by an endless, open-world ocean. In a place like this, a grid can't possibly exist.
 </p>
 <p>
  The concept behind this city-builder is truly captivating, making it even more fascinating to engage with and see it all come to life. While it may not rank as the most in-depth or even the most replayable title in terms of traditional city-builders, there's nothing shallow about
  <em>
   Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles'
  </em>
  wholly unique approach to the genre.

  Stepping back to 2005,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black &amp; White 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a monumental addition to the city-builder genre, offering a unique experience unlike anything that came before it. The game featured brilliant, puzzle-like gameplay, combat, an interactive map, and, of course, colossal creatures to command. It was also one of the first to move away from a grid-based system, allowing players the freedom to place buildings anywhere within the designated area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though it doesn’t follow the typical structure of gameplay found in traditional city-builders, operating instead with a series of level-based areas of increasing difficulty,
  <em>
   Black &amp; White 2
  </em>
  still leverages its gameplay strengths effectively and is undoubtedly part of a franchise that deserves a reboot.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Memoriapolis
   </strong>
  </em>
  prides itself on being a city-builder that allows players to guide a civilization through multiple historical ages, starting in the Age of Antiquity and progressing to the Middle Ages. While it offers the freedom to choose the placement of buildings, similar to many gridless city-builders, in this case, a settlement will gradually develop autonomously, constructing itself around existing structures as more inhabitants arrive to settle.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a unique system that effectively capitalizes on the lack of a grid, enhancing the sense of an expanding civilization while minimizing the micromanagement often required in many other city-building games. With intricate faction and policy mechanics that guide a city toward success, along with the inclusion of Wonder buildings reminiscent of the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Memoriapolis
  </em>
  is a remarkable historical addition to the genre.

  Focusing more on village-building exercises than city-building,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Ostriv
   </strong>
  </em>
  allows players to create an 18th-Century Ukrainian settlement featuring thatched houses and asymmetrical neighborhoods. While it may not sound glamorous,
  <em>
   Ostriv
  </em>
  offers a high level of personalization in how the player imagines their village. The game uses a drag-and-drop system of pinning the size of houses and resource buildings, permitting the player to shape their village and the game map according to their preferences.
 </p>
 <p>
  The building mechanics in
  <em>
   Ostriv
  </em>
  come together to create a village that feels genuinely organic and lived-in. This sense of realism is both heightened and tested by the game's emphasis on resource management and labor dynamics, which are crucial aspects of this title's sometimes challenging gameplay, especially towards the endgame. With the freedom to build as they wish, players are encouraged to adopt a strategic mindset and plan ahead, enabling them to overcome obstacles effectively as they arise.

  Another remarkable entry in the historical city-building genre,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Manor Lords
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands out for its impressive use of a gridless design that captures the essence of a Medieval European town in exquisite detail. The game's city-building mechanics are not only intricate but also historically accurate, often leaving players amazed at how closely the in-game towns mirror actual reconstructions of mid-14th-century settlements. One of the standout features of this gridless system is the introduction of burgage plots—versatile living spaces that can be uniquely tailored into almost any shape imaginable.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  poses some optimization challenges regarding the dimensions and location of building placement, players essentially have the freedom to create a vibrant and dynamic settlement in any way they choose. Starting from a humble camp, they can transform it into a sprawling town in no time with just a few clicks.

  Charming, adorable, and relaxing,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Foundation
   </strong>
  </em>
  provides immense joy in constructing a whimsical Medieval village. Instead of manually placing residential buildings, like
  <em>
   in Memoriapolis,
  </em>
  villagers autonomously build in areas designated by the player. This creates highly lifelike and organic gameplay, ensuring that no two villages ever look the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the key feature of
  <em>
   Foundation
  </em>
  is the ability to construct buildings without relying on prefabricated structures. This brilliant system allows players to assemble a building incrementally, room by room, reaching heights not thought impossible. It serves as an advanced personalization tool that seamlessly fits into a game already centered on individual creativity, utilizing its gridless formula in the best way possible.

  Aero Rover is the next elemental variant of Rover in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Wuthering Waves
   </strong>
  </em>
  , set to debuting in Version 2.2. Their kit revolves around being a sub-DPS and team-wide healing, making them a versatile addition to any team. Aero Rover's most notable abilities include Resonance Liberation, Omega Storm, which not only deals damage but also heals all allies. Similarly, their Forte Ability also allows them to heal allies, while also with Windstring stacks deal more damage. Additionally, Aero Rover's Skyfall Severance removes other elemental debuffs from enemies 9Spectro Frazzle, Havoc Bane, Fusion Burst, Glacio Chafe, and Electro Flare) and converts them into Aero Erosion stacks, making them a suitable ally for various team compositions - regardless of elements especially if they apply elemental effects often.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  What makes Aero Rover particularly appealing is their accessibility and ease of building, even for free-to-play players. Their signature weapon, Bloodpact's Pledge, is a
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2172819">
   free 5-star sword
  </span>
  obtainable through following the main quest of version 2.2, which perfectly complements their abilities by boosting healing and Resonance Skill damage. That said, while it may take some time to fully build Aero Rover due to the inability to pre-obtain their ideal Echoes, weapon, or Resonance Chain, players will not need to rely on an extensive amount of resources to complete their build.

 <p>
  When building Aero Rover in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , the standout weapon choice is undeniably their signature 5-star sword,
  <strong>
   Bloodpact's Pledge
  </strong>
  . As a free-to-play option specifically tailored for Aero Rover, this weapon perfectly complements their abilities, providing Energy Regen, Resonance Skill DMG and Aero DMG Amplification. Given its accessibility and alignment with their kit, players don’t need to look much further, as this weapon ensures Aero Rover can perform at their best without requiring premium pulls or excessive resources, while having mostly a DPS focus as far as it's effects go.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, some alternative 5-star and 4-star weapons could also work for Aero Rover, depending on availability and specific playstyles.
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2185059">
   Changli's signature Blazing Brilliance
  </span>
  boosts both Attack and Resonance Skill Damage while also providing Crit DMG, making it a viable offensive choice.
  <strong>
   Emerald of Genesis
  </strong>
  , with its Energy Regeneration, ATK% and even some crit rate, is another excellent option for balancing utility and damage output. It can be a great option for those that don't enjoy swapping weapons between characters or builds in particular, since Emerald of Genesis also works for Spectro and Havoc Rover variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, players can also opt-in for some 4-star options like
  <strong>
   Overture
  </strong>
  for
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2171789">
   Concerto generation
  </span>
  and Energy Regen or
  <strong>
   Commando of Conviction
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Lumingloss
  </strong>
  if they need more ATK which will come in handy for more healing and DPS potential. Generally speaking however, Bloodpact's Pledge should be the option they are aiming for, as long as they have the resources to upgrade it right away while also progressing in the story.

 <p>
  To optimize Aero Rover in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , the best Echo setup prioritizes maximizing Aero DMG capabilities while allowing flexibility for supportive roles.
  <strong>
   Reminiscence Fleurdelys
  </strong>
  as the Main Echo is specifically designed for Aero Rover, offering a 10% Aero DMG Bonus, with an additional 10% bonus when equipped by Aero Rover. This makes it the optimal choice for maximizing Aero Rover's output. It is part of the newly introduced
  <strong>
   Gusts of Welkin Echo Set
  </strong>
  , launched alongside Aero Rover’s debut. This set grants a 2-piece bonus of +10% Aero DMG and a powerful 5-piece effect that increases Aero DMG for all Resonators when Aero Erosion is applied—a mechanic Aero Rover frequently utilizes. This setup is the most effective for players aiming to maximize Aero Rover’s Aero damage potential over their healing capabilities.

  For players unable to immediately acquire Reminiscence Fleurdelys and Gusts of Welkin, the
  <strong>
   Sierra Gale Echo Set paired with Nightmare: Feilian Beringal
  </strong>
  as the Main Echo is a suitable alternative for an Aero DPS focus. While Sierra Gale provides a solid Aero DMG boost, Feilian Beringal increases Aero Rover’s Aero DMG
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2174270">
   without requiring Echo skill activation
  </span>
  . However, the Heavy ATK Bonus from Feilian Beringal is less useful for Aero Rover, making it a secondary option compared to Gusts of Welkin. For players focusing primarily on healing and team support, the
  <strong>
   Rejuvenating Glow Echo
  </strong>
  Set is recommended. This configuration, when paired with
  <strong>
   Fallacy of No Return
  </strong>
  as the Main Echo, emphasizes healing while providing an ATK buff for the entire team. This allows Aero Rover to take on a defensive or utility-focused role without sacrificing all offensive contributions.

  The recommended Echo loadout should follow a
  <strong>
   4/3/3/1/1
  </strong>
  cost distribution, effectively balancing Aero DMG and supportive stats. Aero Rover benefits most from stats like
  <strong>
   Healing Bonus, Aero DMG Bonus, ATK, and Energy Regeneration
  </strong>
  , so players should adjust these based on their team’s needs and the intended role for Aero Rover. Substats such as Resonance Skill Bonus, Energy Regeneration, and ATK further enhance their flexibility and utility. Generally, prioritizing
  <strong>
   ATK%
  </strong>
  sub-stats is ideal for both offensive and defensive capabilities, as Aero Rover's

  . Players should typically gain sufficient Energy Regen for enabling Aero Rover’s Resonance Liberation through the bonus stat of Bloodpact's Pledge, or by using 3-star Echoes with Energy Regeneration. Resonance Skill Bonus is a secondary consideration for increasing Aero Rover’s damage output, though it generally provides diminishing returns. Crit values are also useful for players focusing on heavily optimizing Aero Rover for damage, even without relying entirely on Aero Erosion mechanics.

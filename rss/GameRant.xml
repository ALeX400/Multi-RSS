 <p>
  Valve’s recently revealed MOBA game, titled
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deadlock
   </em>
  </strong>
  , became one of the most popular games on Steam over the weekend, surprising very few. Even while still unannounced,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  was a common topic on social media, thanks to its rather unorthodox method for gaining alpha test players, which made it inevitable that the game would not be secret for long.

 <p>
  In May, Valve made its upcoming game
  <em>
  </em>
  available to play testers, but the only way to get into the
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  alpha was by receiving an invite from somebody who was already in it. This led to several threads being created on Valve’s official Reddit page and Discord for people to exchange Steam ID numbers. The unannounced title amassed tens of thousands of players, with
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  surpassing even
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s numbers.

 <p>
  Valve lifted the embargo on
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  alpha players on August 23, allowing details of the game to be openly discussed and screenshots, videos, and guides shared online. Since then, the game has performed exceedingly well on Steam. While it currently sits at a modest 26,000 players, over the weekend, the now highly anticipated game hit 89,203 peak players and became the 12th most played game on the platform, falling just below the likes of
  <em>
   Call of Duty, Apex Legends,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5.
  </em>

 <p>
  This is particularly noteworthy because, even though
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  now officially exists, very little is known about the game. It is riding primarily on the tailwinds of Valve’s reputation as a top tier game developer.
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  ’s Steam page is about as barren as they come, with its description stating vaguely that it’s “a multiplayer game in early development” with lots of “temporary art and experimental gameplay.” The product page doesn’t even provide PC requirements, besides specifying that it requires a 64-bit processor and OS to play.

 <p>
  Despite this, there are a few details that were leaked about the 6-vs-6 hero shooter over the past few months and have since been confirmed.
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  was initially meant to be a
  <em>
   Dota
  </em>
  spinoff called
  <em>
   Neon Prime
  </em>
  and was being developed by that game’s lead designer, an individual called IceFrog. Though
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  ’s Steam page lists the developer as Valve, IceFrog is still generally believed to be part of the team working on the company's newest title, and according to play testers, the game plays similarly to
  <em>
   Dota.
  </em>

  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  will reportedly also feature a roster of 19 diverse characters, which were leaked prior to the embargo lifting. These will fill the expected range of roles required for a well-rounded MOBA, including a healer with crowd control named Kelvin; a warrior called Lash; Grey Talon, who wields a bow and sets traps; and an assassin known as Infernus who can use fire and DoTs.

  However, as always, with the new Competitive Season, content, and Hero tweaks and changes, there is also a series of new cosmetics and collectibles that can be obtained from sources such as the Season 12 Battle Pass, or the Overwatch Shop. Among the cosmetics available this season, there is Sojourn's Barista Bundle, which includes the much-loved Barista skin, a victory pose, voice line, weapon charm, and more. This bundle can be earned for free during a limited time this season, so if you're wondering how to obtain it, then the guide below will provide you with all of the knowledge you'll need to do so.

  Luckily for those who are seeking to earn Sojourn's Barista Bundle for free, the process is relatively straightforward, as this is a Twitch drop available between the dates of
  <strong>
   August 20 - August 31, 2024
  </strong>
  . Players who watch a certain amount of hours on
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  streams with Drops enabled during this period can earn each part of the Bundle one by one. However, there you will first need to ensure your Battle.net and Twitch are linked beforehand, to ensure you don't miss out on the opportunity and can successfully claim your freebies.

  has officially revealed the characters and weapons that will appear on the first banner of the upcoming Version 5.0.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  's next update will introduce the long-awaited Natlan region, meaning players can expect tons of content to arrive, including new characters and weapons.

 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  's updates are divided into two banner cycles that offer different sets of limited characters and weapons. It has become standard for each of these cycles to feature a double banner, allowing players to pull for two different five-star characters simultaneously while building up the same pity count. Five-star units have a 90-wish pity, meaning players are guaranteed a five-star drop within 90 pulls.

  's official Twitter account has revealed more details about the weapons and four-star characters that will be featured on the Phase 1 banner.

  Surf's Up will be a powerful catalyst that can be used by many DPS characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . The fact that its passive is tied to Vaporize indicates that it will be a great fit for both Hydro and Pyro users whose team comps revolve around this powerful elemental reaction.

 <p>
  Kaedehara Kazuha is one of the best supports in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , which is one of the reasons why his signature weapon, Freedom-Sworn, is considered by many to be a must-have. It amplifies Kazuha's ability to adapt to almost any team composition and provide multiple buffs while shredding the enemy's resistance.

      These claims match with prior reports suggesting the PS5 Pro will hit the store shelves during the 2024 holiday season.

  The
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5 Pro
  </strong>
  announcement could be imminent, as suggested by some recently surfaced reports. This turn of events adds to the growing list of indications that the new PS5 console could hit the market in late 2024.

  PS5 Pro rumors have been circulating the industry since spring 2022, though it took another year for them to start yielding some concrete claims about the purported console's specs. According to several subsequent insider accounts, Sony started sending out the PS5 Pro dev kits circa March 2024. This made some industry watchers convinced that the mid-generation PS5 refresh is targeting a late 2024 release.

  PS5 Pro Is Reportedly on the Horizon

  This was now once again suggested by Lorenzo Fazio, an editor at Italian gaming outlet Multiplayer. During a recent Twitch livestream, Fazio reported that one of the developers he met up with during Gamescom 2024 mentioned that their company delayed its game, which was targeting a late 2024 release, after learning that the PS5 Pro was coming soon. The journalist did not elaborate whether the postponement was made in order to match up with the much-rumored console's release or with the goal of avoiding it. Regardless, this second-hand information suggests that the PS5 Pro will be announced sooner rather than later.

  Wccftech later corroborated this report, also citing an unnamed developer source from Gamescom 2024. The same source is also said to have insisted that the PS5 Pro will have a much easier time running Unreal Engine 5 games on account of its hardware improvements.

  PS5 Pro Announcement Might Happen in September 2024
 </h3>
 <p>
  Both of these claims match up with several prior reports from industry insider Tom Henderson, who suggested that Sony is planning to release the PS5 Pro during the 2024 holiday season. If that time frame were accurate, the console would likely be revealed a few months ahead of its commercial debut. For reference, the PS4 Pro was officially announced in early September 2016 before hitting the store shelves in mid-November of the same year, so there's still time for history to repeat itself with the PS5 Pro this year.

 <p>
  Even if the much-rumored console isn't made official in early September, there will be at least one other opportunity for Sony to announce it next month. Namely, the Japanese gaming giant recently confirmed it will attend Tokyo Game Show 2024 as an exhibitor, returning to the annual convention for the first time in half a decade. This prompted some speculation that the PS5 Pro might be announced or showcased on September 26, which is when TGS 2024 is scheduled to kick off.

  For some gamers, romance is an integral part of any
  <strong>
   RPG
  </strong>
  experience. In the midst of saving the world, grinding out enemies, chasing down better gear, and leveling up, some players feel the need to find that special someone for their characters. For many, it's an important part of role-playing within the world of the game.

  Many of the more modern
  <strong>
   RPGs have embraced romance
  </strong>
  and given players a number of NPCs for their characters to woo. Here are some RPGs that have the most options when it comes to courtship, marriage, or just casual flings.

   RPGs are all about immersing the player in a new universe and giving them a new identity. This new universe could be different from the real one in many ways, but there is no doubt that love exists in every given universe, and the player can create a bond with other in-game characters and strengthen it.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Many RPGs do care about love, and they give the player the option to have relationships with certain characters, have romance options, marry them, and even give birth to children. And all of this just adds up to the level of immersion, helping players to lose themselves in the game's world.

  As one of the best indie roguelikes on the market, Hades is not just a game about beating bosses and strengthening a build. The game also has a deep story to tell with a few romance options that let the players form a bond and strengthen them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, there are 3 romanceable options in Hades, and the player can build up relationships with all three characters in a single run, and it will not affect the story. Enabling the romance, however, requires a lot of work, as the players need to do some favors to those characters and give them gifts to add more depth to their relationship.

 <p>
  For a survival RPG like
  <em>
   Medieval Dynasty
  </em>
  , it is quite refreshing to feature a romance system that focuses on forming a family. The game doesn't have any cinematics or animation for the romance, but it mostly focuses on the actions of the player and the choices they make to attract girls.
 </p>
 <p>
  The player first needs to flirt with the girl they love to increase the affection. Once this parameter reaches the threshold, the player can offer a marriage, and if it is accepted, a family is formed. The player's wife does help him with different parts of managing the dynasty, but managing the relationship is still important during the marriage. Otherwise, the affection would start to decrease, and the wife could eventually leave the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Medieval Dynasty
  </em>
  also provides the option to have a child. Once the child is born and raised, the player can choose to continue playing as the heir when the original character gets too old or even dies.

  The first BioWare game to delve into romance, BioWare did so wholeheartedly with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In a world fraught with danger and various factions levying their power for good or otherwise, not to mention the evil mage serving as the main antagonist, the player character can still make the time to woo their traveling companions if they wish to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original game consisted of only four romanceable companions, but the Enhanced Edition included a further four eligible bachelors and bachelorettes players could court while facing off against the dangers in the world. But there are some gender and race exclusions for certain characters. For example, players wanting to romance Jaheira must be a male human, elf, half-elf or halfling, something to take into consideration if the player's eye falls on someone in particular.

  Romance is a staple component of any BioWare game, and this holds true in the fourth installment in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Set after the events of
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  , and subsequently
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  , Rook stitches together a rag-tag group to put a stop to the machinations of two elven gods who are trying to infect all of Thedas with the Blight.
 </p>
 <p>
  In between fights for their lives, Rook can hop on back to the Lighthouse and spend some time getting to know the various companions, getting even closer to one of them if they wish. With seven disparate and intriguing romances, players will be spoiled for choice when selecting their chosen paramour.

  As the title of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem: Three Houses
   </em>
  </strong>
  suggests, there are three main houses that players will be given the option of joining as a teacher, but there is more to the job than grading assignments or pushing pencils. They will instead be readying their students for combat, teaching them mastery of weapons and even leading them into battle. The different routes lead the narrative in some different directions, affecting who Byleth will meet and potentially romance.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a grand total of 35 romances, dependent on which House the player allies themselves with and whether they play male or female Byleth, there is an overwhelming amount of options. Thankfully, players aren't just limited to one option and can instead romance more than one character if they find the decision too difficult to make.

  is a game all about balance. In it, players need to devote their time to their studies, delving into the TV world to try and find the culprit of the murders while cultivating their bonds with others to strengthen their power of persona.
 </p>
 <p>
  While developing these bonds, players can choose to take things to the next level with the girls they become friends with, totaling up to a generous 8 options. Each character is completely distinct, embodying a different personality the players may like or dislike depending on their tastes. If they have a tough time choosing, they can date more than one, but most of the girls won't look too kindly on this decision, resulting in a sad Valentine's Day for everyone involved.

  Leading a quiet life as an apprentice to a blacksmith during the troubled 15th century, Henry's quiet life is brought to an abrupt halt when soldiers attack and kill both of his parents, leaving him as an orphan with only one wish: to see his parents avenged. Achieving said revenge will be no small feat, however, as Henry will need to cultivate sword-play to stand a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there is more to life than blood and steel, and a young man fueled by revenge will need to settle down some way. Within the world of
  <strong>
   <em>

   </em>
   ,
  </strong>
  Henry can have his fill of ephemeral dalliances with countless bathmaids, and even a trio of witches, but there are only two women he can truly give his heart to: Lady Stephanie and Theresa. In order to woo either, Henry will need to fulfill certain requirements, such as choosing the right dialogue options and completing specific quests.

  When one slays a local bandit leader in a troubled territory that is ruled by no man, the last thing they expect is to be crowned the region's next leader. Well, this is exactly what happens to the player character in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pathfinder: Kingmaker
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as this act of heroism lends them the title of the Baron or Baroness of the region, and they inherit all the troubles that come with it. Trolls, an infection turning people into beasts, and even an ancient lich are all troubles they must contend with, but players need not do it alone.
 </p>
 <p>
  They can recruit companions to the cause, and the time spent together along with the dangers they survive can strengthen the bonds to friendship or maybe even something more. There are 3 romances in the base game, with the tiefling DLC adding a set of twins that the players can choose to woo if they wish. Each is well-written with its own merits that can make choosing a tough decision.

  </strong>
  changed many things, adding new mechanics while tweaking old ones. But the roster of characters never altered, and neither did the romance options players had the pick of.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to woo the lady of their choice, players would need to spend time with them to increase their Social Link while choosing the right dialogue options. Even the Velvet Room guide Elizabeth could be 'romanced' in a way, but she would not become the protagonist's girlfriend in quite the same way as the others. Nevertheless, each pick provides a different sort of romance, as every character has a unique personality, with different prerequisites.

  The long-waited successor to
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  sees players taking on the role of the Arisen once more, charged with the onerous task of slaying the dragon that marked them as two rival kingdoms clash. In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon's Dogma 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , players can summon Pawns to aid them with their quest and explore the fantastical world by their side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like it's predecessor, players can romance nearly every NPC they meet, but there are two NPCs that grant them a more in-depth romance: Ulrika and Wilhelmina. Romancing them won't be easy, however, as there are certain prerequisites that must be fulfilled.

  This classic JRPG offers a refreshing and unique game with its Steampunk setting and how intrinsically dating is tied into the gameplay. Players can recruit many different characters, who are essential for leveling up weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  As those weapons will be necessary in order to defeat the Dark Acolytes organization that seek to corrupt the peace of the world, players will need to raise the intimacy levels of the cute characters they recruit and take them out on dates. It's a win-win situation.

  for the most part, following the Hawke family as they flee to Kirkwall from the threat of the Darkspawn. Unfortunately, they come to find life in Kirkwall anything but peaceful, as political tensions ramp up between the Mages and Templars, eventually breaking out into a civil war.
 </p>
 <p>
  When not trying to ease tensions and solve other peoples' problems, Hawke can spend time getting to know their rag-tag group of fellow adventurers and even get cozy with a couple. The four main companions, Fenris, Anders, Isabela, and Merrill, can be romanced by Hawke of any gender, but the DLC character Sebastian is available only to female Hawkes. Each of the characters is totally disparate from the others, giving players plenty of different romance options to choose from.

  In this fantasy RPG, there is a dragon who is a herald of the end days and is defeated by a noble Knight and his other brave companions, resulting in them believing the world to be saved. But this peace is fractured when the same dragon returns and steals the heart of the protagonist, marking them as the Arisen, the one destined to face the dragon and stop the apocalypse or die trying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with the stakes so high, there is still time for the player to meet some of the eligible bachelors and bachelorettes that can become the Arisen's beloved. Nearly every character one can meet is romanceable, opening up hundreds of options, including notable characters such as Quina.

  is an AAA title with romance options that could benefit the player at the end. Players will explore their family's past, grow in the ranks, and take some much-needed downtime doing various activities, like dating. With six options, players will have to develop a certain aspect of personality, as well as offer gifts to romance certain women.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each character is different and is interested in certain personality quirks, so players should look ahead at what they should work on when pursuing. Once players reach a certain bond with these characters, they'll receive rewards that could help them in the future. They also have the chance to date every character to receive the best rewards.

  -themed RPG is a fantastic example of the famed tabletop game in video game form, following the story of the player character and their companions who have been infected by a mind flayer parasite that will transform them unless they find someone capable of removing it. Traveling with a party of companions guarantees bonds will deepen, and said connections might even flourish beyond friendship.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  only has six romance options, it's still a well-diverse, great list of characters that can be romanced. Like most of the RPGs listed, all characters have a specific list of needs that need to be met in order to gain a relationship. And like more of the recent releases of RPGs, these characters are all romance options, no matter which gender the player is.

  might be surprising to see on this list due to there only being two well-known romance options; however, there are five minor characters who Geralt can romance that have no effect on the choice of either picking Triss Merigold or rekindling the love with Yennefer of Vengeberg.
 </p>
 <p>
  Granted, players can even choose an eighth option if Geralt ventures into the Brothels to enjoy some added company along his journey. However, whether players want to enjoy their time with several ladies or just stay loyal to the one, it's completely up to them.

  Like a lot of more popular shonen anime,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto
   </em>
  </strong>
  and its follow-up series have spawned many video game adaptations. There are fighting games, RPGs, and even an arcade card battler based on the ninja series. Many of these games have tried their hand at retelling the story arcs of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  , with varying degrees of success.
 </p>
 <p>
  A handful of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games have even tried telling their own original stories featuring the series' main characters. Not all the games have put the story front and center, with some choosing to focus more on action and vs. fighting gameplay. Many
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games have done a good job bringing the anime to life in 3D though, whether that's through telling their own story, or recreating classic arcs. These are the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games with the most complete stories.

 <p>
  Released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2008,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs Sasuke
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a sidescroller that continued the
  <em>
   Naruto: Ninja Council
  </em>
  series and retains much of the gameplay from those earlier 2D games. The game focuses on a smaller series arc to tell a complete story, retelling the Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's the part of the series where Team 7 goes after Sasuke for a supposed rescue, along with new member Sai. It's a relatively short arc, spanning around 20 episodes of the anime. The story focuses heavily on the relationship and rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke, hence the title of the game. Focusing on a small, but significant, arc like this means the game gets to tell a deep and complete story that will be intimately familiar for
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  fans.

  While many of the more recent
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games have included exploration and open environments,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Rise Of A Ninja
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the first
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games to adopt this structure. Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, the game combines full 3D exploration and platforming sections mixed with 2D fighting game-style combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also tells a faithful recreation of the original
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  series, including scenes from the anime itself, from the beginning all the way to the end of the Invasion of Konoha arc. Rather than chopping up scenes and skipping the less action-based parts of the series as many of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fighting games do,
  <em>
   Rise Of A Ninja
  </em>
  captured more of the series' identity with the acrobatic exploration, side quests, and NPC interactions.

  Building on the fighting game combat of the previous
  <em>
   Naruto: Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ultimate Ninja 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  took an interesting approach to its story. The game featured RPG-like progression in its single-player story mode, and had players complete an original storyline set before the start of
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  , before transitioning into retelling the early part of
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  's story.
 </p>
 <p>
  The retelling of the
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  introduction arc ends abruptly, but the original storyline, The Black Shadow, tells a complete and engaging story. The gameplay also took a step forward from the previous
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  games, introducing the idea of clashes and taking advantage of the series' flashier aspects, like Naruto's Nine-Tails transformation, with the addition of Awakening Jutsu.

   <em>
    Naruto: The Broken Bond
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the sequel to
  <em>
   Rise of a Ninja
  </em>
  , and it goes deeper into the series with another faithful retelling of the anime's story. It picks up where the previous game left off at the end of the Invasion of Konoha arc, and continues the series up to the end of the Sasuke Retrieval arc - around episode 135 of the anime.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the previous game,
  <em>
   The Broken Bond
  </em>
  recreated all scenes in 3D, instead of mixing in cutscenes from the anime itself. The game retained the 3D adventure gameplay of
  <em>
   Rise of a Ninja
  </em>
  , adding more environmental exploration aspects, and iterated on the fighting game-style combat with the addition of tag-teams. Its retelling of these pivotal arcs from the main series is well executed, and the game world feels more alive and populated than its predecessor.

  There aren't a whole lot of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games that tell their own original story, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the few that does. The story isn't going to satisfy fans in the same way as the classic arcs of the main series, but it does tell a complete, self-contained tale. It's a typical video game setup. The player needs to collect 5 items, in this case Hope Mirrors, to face off against the antagonists and thwart their plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the game wouldn't win any narrative awards, it at least gets some credit for telling an original story. It further differentiates itself from the majority of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  -based games by using turn-based combat and RPG progression mechanics. The combat has a surprising amount of depth, using front and back rows for unit placement to give increased strategic options to the player. It only really forces the player to make use of their strategic options in the game's harder boss fights, but it's a nice translation of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  character roster's abilities into turn-based RPG form.

  Fighting games aren't generally known for their stories, but one of the core concepts of the
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  series is recreating
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  's most epic battles in a cinematic way. This means that each game has tried to incorporate elements of the series' story to connect these events.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  attempted to elevate this storytelling, using a more linear structure for its story mode than the first game and providing more narrative elements in-between fighting stages.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's still a re-telling of
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  's main events, from Naruto returning to Konoha up to the fight with Pain. It was the best 3D recreation of these scenes at the time, though, and
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
  </em>
  finally told its story in a way that even a player who hadn't watched every episode of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  could understand.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the last game to be released in the
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja
  </em>
  series under its original name. It's one that many
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  fans might have missed out on, as it was only released on the PS2 in Japan, eventually coming to Europe but not the US. It built on the already excellent fighting game gameplay with the addition of assist characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a sign of future
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  games moving toward more narrative elements,
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja 5
  </em>
  separated its story into the single-player RPG mode and allowed players to roam as several Konoha characters to interact with NPCs and follow the series' events that the game focused on (that's the Kazekage Rescue Mission and Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission arcs). It's a familiar part of the series, but interestingly, the game followed the manga rather than the anime, as it covered events past those which had been included in the anime at the time.

  The
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm
  </em>
  games have elevated their storytelling abilities throughout the series.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  might have the best and most complete story of any game in the series, as it was the first one that actually finishes the story of
  <em>
   Naruto Shippuden
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
  </em>
  's main campaign re-tells the Fourth Great Ninja War, the final arc of
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The game arguably tells this part of the story better than the anime did, as it skips some of the unnecessary filler the anime included during this arc. That's not all though. After the main campaign is finished, players can continue to explore and uncover battles that recap the past events of
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shippuden
  </em>
  . That means that
  <em>
   Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
  </em>
  feels like it has one of the most complete versions of the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  story.

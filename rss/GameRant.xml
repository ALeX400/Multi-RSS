  Despite now belonging to one of the countless games in the Soulslike genre,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not without unique features that attempt to set it apart. Even with these unique features,
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  still manages to subject itself to a common criticism of the Soulslike genre.

 <p>
  The Soulslike genre of video games has indeed become increasingly popular over the last decade, to the point that the market is now chock-full of games that are and claim to be Soulslikes. However, Soulslikes aren't without their criticisms, even from loyal fans, and
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  has now joined that list.

 <h3 id="soulslike-games-are-often-criticized-for-relying-too-heavily-on-artificial-difficulty">
  Soulslike Games Are Often Criticized for Relying Too Heavily on Artificial Difficulty
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the biggest criticisms of the Soulslike genre is its frequent reliance on artificial difficulty. The concept of artificial difficulty has been around for quite some time and is especially prevalent in older games that are much shorter than what the industry has to offer today. Shorter games have been known to implement artificial difficulty as a cheap way of preventing players from finishing those games too quickly, and the longer games that take advantage of the concept often seem to rely on it when their well of thought-provoking gameplay mechanics runs dry.

 <p>
  Artificial difficulty manifests itself in a variety of forms, but one of its most prominent forms is simply deepening enemies' health pools to increase their Time-to-Kill. This is an especially common feature in Soulslike games, and one that has been heavily criticized. As the Soulslike genre is all about a challenging experience, its most devoted players expect its games to challenge their strategic decision-making rather than simply increasing the time it takes to complete each game. Soulslike games that rely too heavily on this type of artificial difficulty then subject players to dozens of hours of farming, just so they can make their character strong enough to overpower — rather than outsmart — challenging foes.

  Enotria: The Last Song's Second Region Is a Massive Artificial Difficulty Spike
 </h3>
 <p>
  As many Soulslike games have been known to do,
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  decides to welcome with open arms the common criticism of the genre once players enter its second region.
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's first region is fairly typical of any Soulslike game, gradually introducing players to the game's unique mechanics and increasingly arduous foes, but this also means players can easily learn their way through it and come out on the other side a much more capable version of themselves. The game's second major region, on the other hand, offers players a fake challenge that masquerades as increased difficulty.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":596} -->
 <p>
  While there is a significant difficulty spike when fighting the gatekeeper boss between
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's first and second regions, the rank-and-file enemies of the second region take things up several more notches with much larger health pools than any enemies players may have encountered in the first region. To make matters worse, most of these enemies have similar attack patterns to those found in the first region, so there isn't much room for growth as a player since the only way forward is to farm Memoria, upgrade equipment, and level up one's stats as much as possible.

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_12">

    <p>
     Unfortunately, this trend continues into
     <em>
      Enotria
     </em>
     's third region, showing no signs of quitting, and that includes many of the game's major bosses.

 <p>
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  certainly does its best to set itself apart from other games in the Soulslike genre, but it also chooses to embrace one of the worst qualities of those games in its artificial difficulty spikes. Perhaps there is still time for
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  to receive a patch updating these areas, but that seems like it might be quite a bit of work to implement. Whether that happens, players may have no choice but to spend hours farming Memoria in
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  in order to progress smoothly.

      <title>Best PlayStation Plus Games (September 2024)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  On June 13, 2022, Sony launched its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  in North America. Split into three tiers, this model combines the previous version of PS Plus with PS Now; depending on which level someone subscribes to, they will gain access to certain services and games.
 </p>

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: featured video below first paragraph! -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month):
   </strong>
   This tier is the equivalent of the old PS Plus. A subscription includes online access, monthly free games, and discounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Extra ($14.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential tier benefits, Extra provides access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential and Extra tier benefits, Premium includes a library of classic games (PS3, PS2, PSP, and PS1), trials, and cloud streaming in certain regions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   PS Plus Premium
  </strong>
  has over 700 games covering more than two decades of PlayStation history. Such a huge collection can be overwhelming, and the PS Plus app does not make it very easy to browse through the library; as such, it can be useful to know this tier's highlights before investing in a subscription. Each month, Sony adds a handful of new games. While most of these are PS5 and PS4 releases, they are occasionally accompanied by a few classic titles.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated September 19, 2024 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   The September 2024 PS Plus Extra and Premium lineups are now available, and they feature quite a few decent games. Extra-only subscribers can jump into Night in the Woods, Space Engineers, Road 96, Far Cry 5, or Chernobylite, just to name a few. While none of these are huge names (Far Cry 5 was already on PS Plus once upon a time), they are all unique and top-quality projects in their own right.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, Premium subscribers can boot up a few cult classics like Secret Agent Clank, SkyGunner, and Mister Mosquito. The latter is one of the most bizarre PlayStation games of all time, and it holds up in that area. Pistol Whip is also an option for PSVR2 users, and it is great.

  September 2024 saw the addition of one particularly exciting game to PS Plus Extra, and it was a Day One arrival.

  While not a common occurrence, PS Plus has steadily increased the number of Day One games. September 2024 had two such titles:
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  . The former launched directly on PS Plus Essential, granting subscribers one month to add the magical sports game to their libraries. Meanwhile, the latter is available to everyone committed to the Extra or Premium tiers, and it was the standout game of the month. All Possible Futures'
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  plays around with dimensions as it follows the hero of a storybook who jumps back and forth between their world and the real one. This whimsical premise lends itself well to an imaginative platformer that incorporates fun puzzles along with a bit of action.

 <p>
  Although someone's mileage may vary, this indie project has more than enough charm to warrant a quick try, and the campaign's opening hour should be enough for a player to determine if they want to sit through the whole thing. The PS5 does not have all that many platformers or top-tier family-friendly games, and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is among the console's best efforts in both categories.

  For most months, picking the biggest new PS Plus Extra game is just a matter of personal taste; however, August 2024 was not one of those months. That's not meant as a criticism of games like
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Watch Dogs 2
  </em>
  , but rather a celebration of CD Projekt Red's RPG masterpiece.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the genre, establishing a new era that emphasized storytelling, secondary content, and world-building more than ever before. While not flawless, the 2015 game is arguably timeless, at least up to this point. Hard as it is to believe,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  has been out for nearly a decade, and its shadow continues to loom large over RPGs and even CD Projekt Red specifically.

 <p>
  Due to its popularity and relative accessibility,
  <em>
   Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is probably not a new game for most PS Plus subscribers. Certain projects are so big that they stop being exciting additions to subscription services, simply since most people would already own them. Still, there must be a few exceptions who have never loaded up Geralt's final (full) chapter, and they can now experience the best console iteration since PS Plus Extra has both the PS5 and PS4 versions. They will find an ambitious and (at times) overwhelming open-world RPG with fully realized characters, immersive exploration, rich side quests, and a unique combat system.

  Is this the cutest cult simulator of all time?
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is an unapologetically dark roguelite that follows a Lamb as they diligently work to set the stage for their god's return, a process that involves defeating four bishops, recruiting plenty of followers, and the occasional sacrifice. Roguelikes are a dime-a-dozen nowadays, and the genre can be automatically written off if someone does not see the appeal of endlessly replaying the same loop.

 <p>
  In cases like this, roguelites can act as a fun middle-ground between the replayable nature of roguelikes and more story-driven adventures, and
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  walks this line expertly. While, for the most part, players will revisit the same four (randomly generated) dungeons to try and clear them out and take out their bosses, they will constantly be recruiting new characters for their town/cult, which will further unlock new mechanics and upgrades.

 <p>
  Most importantly,
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is just an absolute sinister delight that revels in macabre imagery and ideas. Along with just being very dark, the humor frequently hits the mark as it constantly pushes the envelope. Furthermore, the gameplay is rock-solid as well, be it the dungeon runs or the town-management aspect. The latter is arguably the best part of the game, as the followers have a ton of personality and evolve alongside the Lamb and cult.

  While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  was the biggest PS Plus game of August 2024, an argument could be made that it was not the most exciting. In a move that was a long time coming, Free Radical Design's
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  trilogy finally made its way to modern systems, with all three PS2 games landing on the PS4 and PS5. These are mostly straight ports of the original versions, and they do show their age in a few ways. However, they are still fantastic console shooters that represent the genre at its early best, especially
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  .

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Both entries are great, and they also shine in somewhat different areas. In terms of pure gunplay,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  is arguably the superior of the two games, and it still sits among the best shooters of all time. Although containing something resembling a plot, the story mode is mostly just a series of extraction-style maps, all of which are well-designed and a blast to master. As the franchise's title suggests, players travel through time, ensuring the stages have quite a bit of variety to them. Co-op is supported as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  has a far more robust and prominent story that creates a cohesive adventure rather than a loosely connected jumble of maps. While not high art, the campaign is fun in the way that a blockbuster can be. The gameplay is quite good, although it is notably less intense and frantic than
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  . Nothing wrong with that, but
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  feels a touch less special in this area.

     The first
     <em>
      TimeSplitters
     </em>
     has charm as well, but it is rightfully overshadowed by both of its sequels. To be clear, the 2000 release is worth a playthrough, as long as newcomers prepare themselves for a somewhat rough experience. Also, its gameplay is not that similar to
     <em>
      TimeSplitters 2
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      Future Perfect
     </em>
     , so do not ignore the latter if the former fails to strike a chord.

  Rockstar's portfolio is not over-represented by PS Plus, but the developer's biggest names are on Sony's service. Added back in May 2024 after already being removed once,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is still a big deal, despite the game being more than 5 years old by this point. An ambitious prequel to 2010's decorated Western,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  brings to life a unique period in American history: the end of the Frontier. The Van der Linde gang represents the dying Wild West, and Arthur Morgan specifically finds himself ripped out of time and in an era that no longer wants his type.

 <p>
  Offering a 50+ hour campaign,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  is an immersive open-world game that emphasizes character-driven storytelling, both in its main quests and also the optional content found across the map. The latter missions tell personal and often emotional stories, and they play a part in shaping Arthur Morgan's personality and (ultimately) destiny. The writing is superb, but that means nothing in the face of unenjoyable gameplay, and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is a peculiar case. Rockstar prioritizes authenticity, delivering an immersive gameplay loop that highlights the tedium that makes up an outlaw's ordinary everyday existence. This decision can be somewhat polarizing, but it does make for a unique experience.

  While the PlayStation 3 had a somewhat slow start to life, the console bowed out in style. Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a haunting action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with infected creatures. The narrative follows the grizzled Joel and the immune Ellie as they travel across the United States in search of a group rumored to be able to craft a cure.

 <p>
  The journey is tough, brutal, and unforgettable. Both of the main characters undergo a great deal of development, particularly Joel, while
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  raises questions of morality through its ambiguous narrative. Even though PS Plus does not have the PS5 remake, the PS4 remaster of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  holds up well and offers a fantastic means to experience an industry-defining gaming story.

  FromSoftware has cornered the hard-hitting action RPG genre through its immaculate
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, and that looks set to continue with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Out of all the studio's many great games,
  <em>
   Bloodborne

  might just be FromSoftware's magnum opus.

  Boasting a Gothic aesthetic and reflex-based combat that demands aggression from players,
  <em>

  There are a handful of
  <strong>
   PS Plus games
  </strong>
  that everyone with an account should play, and 2018's
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  should be at the top of that list. This "reboot" of the series sees Kratos living in a different part of the world, far from the Greecian roots players are used to seeing him in.

 <p>
  Kratos' move to Midgard gave developers a chance to shine a spotlight on some different gods, tapping into the deep Scandinavian folklore surrounding the Norse Gods and their mythology. With RPG elements, an incredible story, breathtaking visuals, and some awesome combat mechanics,
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   must-play PS Plus game

  While not unheard of, Day 1 PS Plus arrivals are rare, with most months not featuring this type of release. Consequently, whenever an exception materializes, it is always a cause for celebration; more importantly,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is an exceptional exception. Technically, Mintrocket's indie darling has been around since 2023, but it had to wait until April 16, 2024, to make its PlayStation debut, so it still counts as a Day 1 addition. When this year comes to an end,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will almost certainly be remembered as one of the best PS Plus newcomers.

 <p>
  Combining restaurant management with fishing, Mintrocket created a package that feels oddly unique, despite sharing similarities with many other projects. As Dave, players have two general responsibilities: catch and serve fish. The former takes up the protagonist's days, forcing him to constantly make trips into an evolving ocean in search of materials that can be used to create sushi at his restaurant. Naturally, the nights are spent running the establishment, making sure that customers are satisfied. While the management aspect is not as deep as some other titles on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  gives players more than enough control to make these segments engaging. However, the fishing element is the game's highlight and adds the most replay value.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is without question the most famous horror franchise in gaming, and it is eternally linked to the PlayStation brand. Premium subscribers can play through a healthy selection of entries from Capcom's license, including classics such as
  <em>
   Resident Evil Code: Veronica X
  </em>
  , polarizing sequels like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , and HD remasters of masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . The Extra tier does not have quite as robust of a catalog, although it includes two notable projects in 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake and its sequel. When the main entries successfully shifted to a first-person perspective with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , some fans might have feared that could spell an end for classic third-person releases; fortunately, Capcom relaxed those anxieties with a couple of stellar remakes.

 <p>
  2020's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is the weakest of Capcom's modern remakes, although it is still a solid action-horror game that does justice to the classic PS1 original. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is considerably more complete and satisfying, delivering a robust two-protagonist campaign that is consistently intense and terrifying. The controls are immaculate, the visuals are stunning, and the sound design is among the best in the genre – an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is almost the perfect horror game.

  is an inspired Metroidvania with simple but effective controls. For the most part, the game sticks very close to the genre's standard formula of unbound exploration, puzzles, platforming, and the gradual reveal of new items that provide access to different areas; however, Shared Memory succeeded in stitching these well-worn pieces together to create something that feels at least somewhat fresh. A big part of this comes down to
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  's haunting aesthetic and ambient music, which combine to create a campaign oozing in atmosphere and style, making up for a lack of a conventional story.

  Although fun, the platforming sections are quite easy, with most of the jumps providing players with plenty of room for error. However,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is still pretty darn difficult due to its puzzles, very open nature, and clever boss fights. The game's brainteasers often require lateral thinking (and clever use of a slink), while the latter could cause players to feel lost on occasion. That said, the in-game map is detailed and useful.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  is among the most high-profile PS5 games available on PS Plus Extra. As a console exclusive, this reveal seemed destined to transpire sooner or later, although almost two years from the game's debut had to pass for this moment to arrive.
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  might very well still be the most beautiful PS5 title on the market, a testament to Insomniac's mastery of technology and talent for creating vibrant and stunning worlds that would not look out of place in a Pixar movie.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  backs up its good looks with fantastic gameplay and an enjoyable story that allows its lovable characters to shine. Although Ratchet and his robotic companion take center stage, they are accompanied by a new playable Lombax in the form of Rivet, who also comes with her own partner. In combat, the characters largely control the same; however, the game does a great job of establishing Rivet's own identity through her personality.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  lives and dies on the strength of its gameplay, and

  While not quite as recognizable as Naughty Dog or Insomniac, Housemarque has been producing PlayStation gold for more than a decade, and the studio was even picked up by Sony in 2021.
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  are fantastic and easy recommendations for anyone who enjoys shoot 'em ups or top-down shooters, respectively; however, Housemarque's portfolio seemed to be all leading to one particular project:
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  . Among the first titles to truly showcase the next-generation hardware, the 2021 release is still comfortably among the best PS5 games, even if it comes with a fairly steep learning curve.

 <p>
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is a roguelike third-person shooter set on a strange alien planet. As Selene, players will have to make their way through six biomes, all of which are reasonably large, filled with secrets, feature unique enemies, and culminate in spectacular boss fights. Death means returning to the start or the mid-point, depending on how far someone managed to get. As with most roguelikes, players need to find and upgrade their weapons and stats during each run, and things like parasites and artifacts add extra nuance.

  The 2010s was the decade of indie games, so much so that it is near impossible to select the independent scene's crowning achievement for that period. That said,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the top contenders. Inspired by the
  <em>
   Mother
  </em>
  series, Toby Fox's RPG follows a child as they explore the Underground, a seemingly typical monster-filled setting for the genre. Obviously, players can decide to adhere to RPG tradition and massacre everything that moves, but they do not have to do that.
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  does not force anyone to play a certain way, and players can follow a few different routes.

 <p>
  Blending meta-commentary with nuanced world-building and a strong narrative,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is the full package. Anyone remotely interested in RPGs or just gaming in general should give this seminal project a try, and the game's player-driven structure means multiple playthroughs are encouraged.

  While no longer exclusive to PlayStation consoles,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  will always be associated with Sony's brand to an extent. In recent years, Capcom has tried to lower the barrier of entry for the franchise, crafting projects that are more accessible in their opening hours, all the while retaining most of the earlier entries' depth.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is the most beginner-friendly project in the series, and it comes with a short "campaign" that should teach the basics in roughly 10 hours. Just to be clear to people not familiar with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , finishing
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  's village quests and rolling the credits only means they have completed the tutorial. Now, they can focus on working through the Gathering Hub missions as they collect resources to craft better equipment, allowing them to take on harder quests that will reward higher-tier resources. Repeat the cycle until the end of time (or until it becomes dull).

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  has a fairly simple formula, but it is expected to perfection. Lasting less than an hour at most (and usually considerably shorter), quests drop players in open but not massive maps which will have a few major monsters, including that mission's specific target. Players will then have to track down the enemy and slowly whack away at their health, all the while utilizing the tools at their disposal. Eventually, the fun comes in the preparation for each hunt, crafting a loadout designed to fully target a monster's weaknesses while elevating the hunter's strengths.
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has a robust selection of weapon types as well, and they all control differently.

 <p>
  PS Plus has more than a few Soulslike games, reflecting the genre's explosion in popularity over the last couple of years. In most cases, people's first exposure will be a FromSoftware project, be it
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  . These are all great places to start, but if the introductory game fails to hit the mark with a new player, they might conclude that Soulslikes are just not for them and ignore any releases by other developers. While most titles take heavy inspiration from the
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games, the genre has enough variety to offer genuine alternatives that do their own thing. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games serve as prime examples of Soulslikes with unique identities that set them apart from their contemporaries. The first game is not available on PS Plus, but Sony's subscription service has the (arguably) superior sequel.

  Starting with the most "obvious" distinction,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is predominantly a third-person shooter, although melee weapons are available as secondary options. Players steadily gain access to a respectable selection of hand and long guns, with the latter generally acting as a loadout's main option. While most guns are purchased rather than looted, enemies regularly drop mods and mutators that can be used to modify builds on the fly, providing customization without flooding the inventory.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  's class system is also fantastic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is at its best when played in 3-player co-op, to the point that many of the archetypes (classes) and bosses feel tailor-made for parties rather than solo runners. The latter can pick a class that includes a dog companion, so they have an option; however, they might find the campaign to be quite difficult, even on the lowest challenge level. Still, the gameplay is fun, the build variety is solid, and the world-hopping structure is pretty awesome. The bosses are also awesome, including a few that have an impressive sense of scale.

  Slow as the process has been, Sony is steadily bringing more PlayStation Portable (and PS1/PS2) games to PlayStation Plus, making a few fairly unknown titles available on modern consoles. Premium subscribers have roughly two dozen games at their fingertips, including some fantastic titles that deserve to be readily accessible. While this selection barely makes a dent in the PSP's vast and impressive library, the fact that minor classics like
  <em>
   Size Matters
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ridge Racer 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Daxter
  </em>
  can now be played with the click of a button is great.

 <p>
  Out of all the PSP games that are part of the Premium tier,
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  presents a convincing case for being the absolute best. Level-5's tactical JRPG was well-received in 2006, but its PSP-exclusive caused it to fall into obscurity after a while. Therefore, the announcement that
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  would be ported to the PS4 and PS5 was a big deal, and the game survived the transition in one piece. As the title suggests, the story takes inspiration from the Hundred Years' War and Joan of Arc, incorporating historical touches and figures. That said, demons are involved, and the campaign takes plenty of over-the-top turns that drop it squarely into fantasy territory. It is a fine story carried by great characters.

 <p>
  The turn-based combat will likely not hold too many surprises for people familiar with the tactical JRPG subgenre, albeit with a few unique touches (like transformations) that help set it apart from the crowd. The battle system is deep and challenging, which it needs to be since
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  is quite long. Whether someone is familiar with the PSP original or not, this title is one to check out or revisit.

  A reliable source claims that
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  is gearing up to announce an "even less exciting" remaster than the recently leaked
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  in the coming weeks. Both of these remasters could show up at the State of Play presentation that PlayStation is heavily rumored to air this month.

  After the May 2024 State of Play accrued mixed reactions, PlayStation fans have been clamoring for a bigger Showcase livestream that announces some new tentpole first-party games from the gaming giant's bigger in-house studios. Contrary to the demands, though, PlayStation is apparently planning a State of Play for late September. However, this presentation may not be as light on first-party announcements as previous State of Plays, as recent reports point to the September livestream being "pretty big."

  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  's recent ESRB rating leak may have been the first proper sign of a potentially imminent State of Play, since the game hasn't been announced yet. Now, credible industry insider Jeff Grubb has chimed in on the discussion, alleging the existence of another PlayStation remaster due to be revealed very soon alongside
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  . In a recent episode of the Game Mess Mornings podcast, Grubb stated that PlayStation is working on an "even less exciting" remaster than
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  , which will "probably" be announced at the upcoming September State of Play.

  The insider didn't name this mystery remaster, but specifically noted that "it's definitely not
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  ." The pleas for a
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  remaster on PS5 and PC have subsisted for years due to the base game's 30fps framerate cap on PS4. Unfortunately, though, despite 2025 being
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  's 10-year anniversary, Grubb said that he hasn't heard of Sony doing anything with the critically-acclaimed FromSoftware title. There's always a chance that the insider could receive new information at a later time that suggests otherwise, but
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  fans likely shouldn't hold their breaths.

  It's also difficult to pin down what Grubb means by a "less exciting" remaster, since games are an inherently subjective matter. As far as rumors go, a
  <em>
   Gravity Rush 2
  </em>
  remaster for PS5 and PC was purported to be in the works earlier this year, but the leaker behind it hasn't provided any updates since. Other than that, PlayStation fans speculate that
  <em>
   Detroit: Become Human
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Order: 1886
  </em>
  are also likely candidates for a remaster, since they're both locked to 30fps via backwards compatibility on PS5. Hopefully, the mystery surrounding this remaster won't last too long, as the State of Play is rumored to air on September 24.

  The head of
  <strong>
   Krafton
  </strong>
  explained that the South Korean publisher acquired Tango Gameworks in an effort to preserve the shuttered studio's legacy. Krafton is the parent company of Bluehole, PUBG Studios, and Unknown Worlds Entertainment, just to name a few.

  In June, Microsoft announced the closure of Tango Gameworks, its sole Japan-based development studio. The move shocked many in the industry as the affected team was behind the well-received
  <em>
   Evil Within
  </em>
  series and, most recently, 2023's critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  , widely regarded as one of the most charming games in Xbox's already limited portfolio of first-party properties. Krafton, the publisher of
  <em>
   PUBG: Battlegrounds
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  , ended up purchasing Tango Gameworks from Microsoft for an undisclosed amount, and the reason behind the acquisition has finally been revealed to the public.

  Krafton CEO Changhan Kim said in an interview with Game Developer that his company wanted to secure as many people from Tango Gameworks as possible to continue the studio's legacy. According to Kim, the developer's releases were not considered massive hits, but the team itself was filled with many creatives who were worth pursuing. The head executive added that the cost of the acquisition, which was apparently a last minute deal, was neither too expensive nor too cheap. Kim pointed out, however, that the amount exchanged was not really important to video game giant Microsoft. "We cannot really translate the volume into money. It's more about the significance," Krafton's head explained.

  Around 50 developers from Tango Gameworks were supposed to be transferred to Krafton's Japanese subsidiary, journalist Stephen Totilo reported. These employees would have continued working on new projects, including an expansion of the
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  IP that Krafton was also able to acquire. Kim is hoping for Tango Gameworks to contribute to Krafton's goal of increasing its lineup of games. While the CEO believes that a
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  sequel would likely be unprofitable for his company, its development would be a part of Krafton's strategy to produce titles that feel innovative rather than derivative.

 <p>
  Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty previously alluded to the dissolved developer's leadership as being a factor in its shutdown. Tango Gamesworks founder Shinji Mikami left the studio in 2023 out of a desire to attain more creative control and to distance himself from the survival horror genre with which he had become largely associated. The veteran game designer revealed that he actually wanted to leave around eight years earlier, but he stayed to finish ongoing projects.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball Daima
   </strong>
  </em>
  has yet to air, but it feels like a video game adaptation of the series is inevitable. Even beyond
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  being one of the most famous anime franchises in existence,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  will bring up some entirely new possibilities. From what has been revealed so far, there are a host of elements that should make
  <em>
   Daima
  </em>
  a unique installment in the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  series. It will be interesting to see how the anime plays out, but it's also worth looking into how well it could lay the groundwork for a video game adaptation.

  Ahead of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  's debut on Crunchyroll, fans have a few breadcrumbs of what to expect. The most remarkable twist revealed is the fact that Goku and friends are going to be turned into children and cast into the Demon Realm by some new foes. Even though Goku and Krillin have been fighting since they were kids in the original
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , it has been decades since that time. As for the rest of the aged-down cast, their fights will be an entirely new experience. The new dynamic of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  will ensure an unique set of fights in the future.

  Dragon Ball Daima's Premise Could Let Players Build Up the Protagonists
 </h3>
 <p>
  A developer could make an action RPG like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  based on
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  for one clear reason. With the main cast turned into children, it would make sense to have mechanics based around them re-developing their fighting abilities and powers. As players go through more fights and level up their characters, they could raise their stats and unlock more abilities. There could even be plenty of customization options as well. Players could build up the fighters similar to canon, or have them develop a new combination of powers.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  's premise is perfect for an RPG.

 <h3 id="dragon-ball-daima-39-s-goku-should-have-a-unique-fighting-style">
  Dragon Ball Daima's Goku Should Have a Unique Fighting Style
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another point is that Goku in a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  game would be different from Goku's variations in other
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games for one reason already stated. In
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  , it's said that Goku will fight with his Power Pole, a weapon that he primarily used in his youth. This addition will give
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  's version of Goku access to a moveset that would differ wildly from most other game appearances. While other characters could have marked differences in their skillsets, Goku's will likely be the most notable.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  could lead to a Goku with a unique style compared to most.

 <h3 id="the-demon-realm-gives-dragon-ball-daima-an-exciting-setting">
  The Demon Realm GIves Dragon Ball Daima an Exciting Setting
 </h3>
 <p>
  The setting of the Demon Realm offers another reason for a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  game. The chance to explore
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  's Demon Realm to a greater extent than before offers up an impressive opportunity. It could provide a whole new part of the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  world to map out, as well as provide a variety of fights against demons, which would be a change of pace from most
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games. Of course, this may depend on how much of
  <em>
   Daima
  </em>
  ends up taking place in the Demon Realm. Either way,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  could break the mold for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games with its setting.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  has the components to make one of the most distinctive
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games in years. While it may be years after
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  for another game in the series to come along,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  has an argument to be next in line. With a premise that lends itself well to a game and a new take on the series' protagonist, there's a lot of potential upside.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  could already have what it takes to make a great game adaptation.

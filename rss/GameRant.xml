      <title>Starfield's New Vehicle Needs a Spiritual Successor in GTA 6</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to be the biggest release of next year. While the wait for a new update continues, there are a lot of questions about what the franchise's return to Vice City will bring to the spotlight. It's already known that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is aiming to be even bigger than its predecessors. From the map size to in-game content, it is expected that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is going to bring the long-running series to new heights.

  Despite the inevitable innovations the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  franchise is set to achieve with its next installment, the game could gain inspiration from an unlikely source.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's new REV-8 vehicle has arrived in the game, finally bringing driving mechanics to Bethesda's sci-fi title. The futuristic buggy may not seem like a good fit for
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  at first, but a spiritual successor could feel right at home in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's setting.

 <p>
  It's exciting enough that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is returning to Vice City after so many years of not seeing the franchise's fictional equivalent to Miami. However, what is even more compelling is the outskirts of the city in the greater state of Leonida. As
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  's interpretation of Florida, Leonida and Vice City need to be rife with content. It's a given that cool cars are going to play a large role in the game, but a buggy inspired by the REV-8 could make
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's crime encounters and outskirts exploration far more fun.

 <p>
  When it comes to Vice City, the urban sprawl is the perfect setting for plenty of heart-pounding police chases. Based on the first and only trailer, it's clear that protagonists Lucia and Jason are going to be on the run from the cops. Various shots of robberies and getaways are showcased throughout the trailer, and throwing a buggy with heavy spring suspension into that formula could make for some hilarious moments. What makes the REV-8 so intriguing is the vehicle's rocket-powered jet mixed with its suspension. Although a rocket-powered buggy may not be featured in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , taking inspiration from the vehicle's bouncy handling would be perfect.

 <p>
  The prospect of being in a high-speed chase and using a buggy's suspension to jump over cop cars in a cartoonish way could bring something fresh to the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  driving mechanics. Even further, the outskirts of Vice City can showcase Leonida's more swampy landscapes, and a flexible, bouncy vehicle similar to the REV-8 could be the perfect way to get around these areas.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is bound to have several vehicles made specifically for swamp exploration, so a versatile buggy seems highly likely.

  From flying cars to armored military machines,
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  features some outlandish vehicles, and
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will probably take this even further.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , and Bethesda games in general, aren't exactly the obvious source of inspiration for vehicles, but the REV-8 has proven to be a promising update to the space exploration title. Thanks to
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  's diverse and occasionally ridiculous vehicle history, a car with a similar concept as the REV-8 is completely possible. Bouncing through the streets of Vice City and doing stunts in the swamps of Leonida is just too fun of an idea to ignore.

 <p>
  Despite last year's announcement trailer, there are still plenty of questions surrounding
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  . Until more information is revealed by Rockstar, the mystery will continue, but it would be surprising if the developer didn't feature a fast, flexible buggy like
  <em>
   Starfield

  's REV-8.

 <p>
  The developers of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Yakuza Kiwami
   </strong>
  </em>
  confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release, which may be disappointing for fans who want a physical version.
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  fans got a very big surprise during the August 2024 Nintendo Direct, where it was revealed that Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  would be coming to Nintendo Switch.
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  is the 2016 remake of the first game in the long-running series, developed as a part of the
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  franchise's 10th anniversary.

 <p>
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  coming to the Nintendo Switch eight years after it first launched was a big shock, as while it originally released on PlayStation 3 and 4, and then later came to PC and Xbox One a few years later, it seemed like there were no plans for a port on Nintendo's systems. Many fans had wanted Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to bring the games to Switch for the longest time, which seemed like a pipe dream until now. Fans may want to temper their expectations a little bit, as the developers have confirmed that
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Switch version will not have a physical release.

 <p>
  This information was confirmed on Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's Japanese Twitter account, stating that the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series is coming to the Nintendo Switch for the first time with the release of
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  . However, the message also notes that it will only be available as a digital download, with no option for a physical version. While the series has done this before, such as the
  <em>
   Like a Dragon Gaiden
  </em>
  spin-off only being distributed digitally in the West but getting physical versions in other regions, it appears that Sega has no plans to do a boxed physical for the release of
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  on Switch.

 <p>
  The lack of a physical version for
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Switch version might be disappointing to hear for some fans, as Sega is usually good at giving gamers the option to own the game physically. The good news is that Sega is pricing
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  appropriately on the Switch, where it costs only $20. This matches the previous price on digital storefronts like Steam, which also costs $20.

 <p>
  It's not entirely out of the question that
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  could get a physical version though, as companies like Limited Run Games usually create their own physical versions to sell to the most ardent fans. For example,
  <em>
   Persona 4 Golden
  </em>
  got a surprise physical release via Limited Run Games after it was ported to Switch, PS4, and Xbox One, so LRG could theoretically do the same for
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Switch version. For the time being,
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  will be a digital-only game on the Switch, and will launch on October 24, 2024.

  players discover a frustrating glitch with Captain America's shield ability, where, under circumstances, they'll be able to use the shield bash technique permanently. Following the mixed reception of last season, most fans were excited to see another new Marvel collaboration for Chapter 5 Season 4 of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . This time around, Dr. Doom is the primary threat as he seeks to gain total control over the island with the aid of the power stolen from Pandora's Box.

  Alongside a collection of Marvel heroes and villains like Gwenpool, Emma Frost, and War Machine to name a few, players can pick up a variety of weapons and items during matches, though one in particular has been proving to be wildly inconsistent. Captain America's Shield, a returning item from the original Endgame LTM, has already frustrated the community due to it being deemed overpowered and tough to counter. Epic has already issued hot fixes addressing the item, though it appears that the shield is plagued by bugs that can impact matches.

  The previously nerfed Captain America's Shield in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  appears to have a new bug which grants players unlimited shield bash. A Reddit user named thatsidewaysdud posted a short clip of them returning to a match and picking up a pistol, Dual SMGs, and a shield potion, though interestingly enough, they were shield bashing the wall like they were using Captain America's Shield. It seems that dying while using the shield and then getting rebooted back into the game may cause that bug to happen, even when not having the item equipped at all. While the attack itself is helpful for breaking walls or pushing enemies away, the bug can't be controlled, which further complicates the issue.

  The user also mentioned that this bug has been a constant problem since the start of Chapter 5, Season 4 on the Xbox Series X, when Captain America's Shield was deemed overpowered by most
  <em>

  players. However, some have found ways around the bug, offering other players tips for potentially solving the issue if it turns up. One user named Commercial_Bag_8729 suggested finding another shield, running with it, then dropping it. While most people in the comments seemed frustrated by this, there were a couple who actually enjoy being able to shield bash at will, damaging other players who are not expecting it.

  Captain America's Shield isn't the only item this season which has struggled to achieve consistency. While Epic has updated Dr. Doom's Monarch Pistol, War Machine's Hover Jets ability has seen a number of changes in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . A recent update brought a handful of nerfs to the item, increasing fuel consumption by 150%, reducing its overall speed, and limiting how often the boost can be used. On top of that, the Hover Jets have been removed from tournament playlists entirely, with many theorizing that it was just easier to disable them outright as even after the nerfs, they can still be problematic.

  seems quite committed to having some fun with its roster choices, as evidenced by Player First Games' choice to re-launch the platform fighter with
  <em>

  ’s Banana Guard. At the time, the pick of playable Banana Guard garnered some controversy, but since then, the character’s been embraced by the community as a goofy, lighthearted addition to the cast with plenty of humorous interactions.

  And it seems the goofy character picks won’t stop there. Reliable
  <em>

  <em>
  </em>
  leakers have shown evidence that the infamous Pickle Rick from the
  <em>
   Rick and Morty
  </em>
  episode of the same name will be joining the game’s roster sooner rather than later. While nothing’s been confirmed by the devs, there’s a lot to break down from the leaks, including some future unannounced roster additions.

  Is Pickle Rick Going to Be a Skin for Rick in MultiVersus?
 </h3>
 <p>
  It’s no secret that Rick Sanchez has been in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  since beta, and most people would assume that his pickle form would just be a skin for the existing character. And that would be a perfectly reasonable assumption if not for the fact that a skin would not nearly be as funny as making Pickle Rick his own standalone fighter. This seems to be the case given the leaked files.

 <p>
  So far,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  characters have been tied to a numbered list in the code. All the Pickle Rick-related files are tied to a unique, yet-to-be-released, fighter on that list. If Pickle Rick was just a legendary skin for the version of Rick currently in the game, one would assume these files would be tied to Rick’s pre-existing code on the list. The player model for Pickle Rick is also properly scaled; being more in proportion to a fighter like Gizmo than Rick’s normal size. Such a hitbox change wouldn’t be possible with a skin and would instead require a new character slot entirely.

 <p>
  As for how the character handles, Pickle Rick seems to play very similarly to the version of the character currently in the game. A leaked gameplay video from before the beta’s shutdown shows a player controlling Pickle Rick with a moveset matching regular Rick almost 1:1, just on a much smaller scale.

     It’s important to note that these are unreleased files from the developers. Early in development, Gizmo and Stripe were listed in the character list as the same fighter. Development cycles change frequently and PFG may end up retooling the leaked Pickle Rick fighter as a simple Rick skin.

  Pickle Rick Voicelines Leaked
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though his character model is already a pretty damning leak, the voicelines that have been coming out are on a whole other level. Pickle Rick’s leaked unique dialogue is all on YouTube, uploaded for all to listen to for more than ten full minutes. All of it has been recorded for the game by Rick’s new voice actor Ian Cardoni, with direct references to other characters currently in the game and not in the game.

 <p>
  Most notable in these interactions are Pickle Rick’s dialogue aimed at the Powerpuff Girls and
  <em>
   RWBY
  </em>
  ’s Ruby Rose. The Powerpuff Girls being referenced in the dialogue isn’t overly surprising as Townsville is already a stage in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  and other Cartoon Network alumni have already made it into the roster. References to Ruby Rose, however, are a lot more surprising, as that would mark the first appearance of an
  <em>
   RWBY
  </em>
  character in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  There's no telling exactly when Pickle Rick may come to
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , if at all. Dataminers from the beta found that Pickle Rick was a fairly finished character nearly two years ago. It could be Player First Games is waiting for an opportune moment to drop the character, or perhaps the studio decided to retool the character into a skin instead. Either way, it seems as if players will soon be able to turn themselves into a pickle in-game. It'll be the funniest thing they've ever seen.

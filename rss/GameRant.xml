  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared a complete Tarot deck based upon Stardew Valley. The Tarot set is impressing fans, and the creator even has permission from
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  developer ConcernedApe to produce it.

 <p>
  An interest in Tarot and
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  may go together for some players. The game certainly isn't without mystical elements, with creatures like mermaids, wizards, spooky reanimated skeletons, and charming Junimos making up just some of the DNA of the game. Whether fans are interested in doing readings or just like the cards for the esthetics, this set is likely to please.

 <p>
  Stardew Valley fan littlemooart previously shared a portion of the
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  Tarot set they were working on, but at that point, it was incomplete. Now, the artist has shared the finished set, which contains 78 individual cards. The Major and Minor Arcana are here, with NPCs primarily making up the Major Arcana, while enemies, items, and animals largely make up the Minor Arcana. For example, Haley is The Empress, Maru is The Star, and Linus is The Hermit. A single Slime is the Ace of Swords, two pieces of cheese make up the Two of Wands, and beer stands in for the Four of Wands.

 <p>
  Players are extremely impressed with the creations, with many getting excited about the idea of owning a set like this. As littlemooart had previously sought and received ConcernedApe's blessing to make this fan art project a reality, they're now running a Kickstarter to get the set produced as a physical set. The Kickstarter closes on August 13, and has already surpassed its goal 4x over, with $3,602 of the $812 goal pledged as of this writing. Those who are interested in buying a set can pledge Â£30 (roughly $39 USD) to get one of the first sets, but only 29 of the 100 slots are remaining at the time of publication. Those who get in later than that will likely have to wait until the additional supply goes on general sale.

  Stardew Valley's Developer Keeps Pleasing Fans
 </h2>
 <p>
  While littlemooart's art and creations are to be commended, the fact that the developer agreed to it, while seemingly taking no cut, is remarkable. ConcernedApe recently made waves by stating that he would never charge for any kind of update made to Stardew Valley. This may not surprise those who know he's been laboring on the game for years to make it what it is today, all for free, but it's still great to hear. The developer is invested in his game's community, and allowing a fan to create a project using his intellectual property is just making players love the game and its developer all the more.

  Twitch streamer MissMikkaa overcame the odds by beating
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  while playing the game on PC and PS5 simultaneously. Famous for her approach to streaming games, this was her way of making
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  even more of a challenge.

 <p>
  The new DLC for
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , called
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , came out this year and has taken the community by storm. It offers players a completely new region to explore, along with powerful new Spirit Ashes, armor sets, consumables, and more. What makes the DLC extremely popular, however, is its difficulty. Players must defeat Mogh, a boss in the main game, before being able to even play the DLC, which in and of itself can take hundreds of deaths to complete.

 <p>
  In a recent Twitch stream, MissMikkaa, The Streamer Awards 2023 top Soulslike streamer, managed to beat the final boss of the DLC while playing the game simultaneously on PlayStation and PC. It took her 239 tries to defeat the final boss of
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , which took place over three separate streams. It's almost double the amount of tries it took for her to defeat Messmer, while it took 609 tries to beat the DLC overall.

 <p>
  Making the game even more difficult is one of the core tenets of the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community. Some players restrict themselves to only using certain weapons or builds that don't take advantage of broken weapons, while others go as far as defeating powerful
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  bosses using rocks as weapons. MissMikkaa went a step even further. Aside from the feat of playing the game on two platforms at the same time, she took it up a notch and is using a dance pad to play the game on PC.

 <p>
  The combination of both feats makes MissMikkaa's skill at playing the game very impressive. To put things into perspective, a famous streamer, xQc, died 25 times trying to beat Rellana using a regular controller, while MissMikkaa beat Rellana with a dance pad in two tries. Add to that playing two separate instances of the game at the same time, and many in the player base are left in awe of her skills. Most state that just watching her play two games simultaneously makes it hard to follow everything happening on the screen, much less trying to emulate her achievement.

      <title>My Time At Sandrock: How To Find Sandrice</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    My Time At Sandrock
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a cozy game that allows players to visit the lovely town of Sandrock and become a builder. In the game, players will be fulfilling orders from customers in town who need different items built. This makes up a large part of the side quest missions. Players will also be able to get points for completing these commissions, so they can work to get a higher score than other builders in town.

  Players will need to go around Sandrock and get materials in order to craft needed items for commissions, and Sandrice is a material players will definitely need to find. However, this one might be a little bit more difficult to track down if players don't know where to find it in
  <em>
   My Time At Sandrock

 <p>
  Sandrice is an ingredient that can be used to cook and craft things within
  <em>
   My Time At Sandrock
  </em>
  . Players are able to find this ingredient on the outskirts of the world, and it grows between the player's home and Rocky's place, east. Players can also grow Sandrice seeds which take about 3 days to grow, but that depends the current in-game season. After the plant is fully grown, it will produce about 6-7 Sandrice with each harvest.

  Sandrice comes in handy outside of side quests as it can also be used as bait while fishing! Asingle Sandrice is required for the Operation: Flowergate missions too, so players should be sure to hang on to one for when the time is right. There is definitely a variety of uses for Sandrice in the game, but simply farming it for money is always useful too. That is everything to know about Sandrice in
  <em>
   My Time At Sandrock

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player managed to catch a Shiny version of Psychic-type Legendary Pokemon Mesprit, which is one of the rarest Pokemon in the game. In
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , Shiny Pokemon appear more often than usual during limited-time events, such as Ultra Unlock and Community Day.

 <p>
  Shiny hunting continues to be a pastime in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , nearly eight years after the game's launch. Since
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  receives new limited-time events and Pokemon on a monthly basis, there are plenty of opportunities to catch Shiny Pokemon in the wild. Specifically, Shiny Pokemon appear more often when encounter rates are boosted.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Fest 2024 and monthly Community Day events are just a few examples of instances where Shiny Pokemon are more likely to appear. On rare occasions, players may encounter Shiny Pokemon in normal everyday encounters.

 <p>
  Reddit user JuixyRaffle recently caught a Shiny Mesprit and inquired about the odds of catching such an elusive Legendary Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  with the Reddit community. The odds of encountering a Shiny variant of any Pokemon are one in 20, but the odds are much lower when trying to encounter Mesprit, according to Low_Hospital1299. The Reddit commenter claims that the odds of catching a wild Shiny Mesprit in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  is one in 100,000, which is one of the lowest encounter rates currently in the game. The odds of catching Shiny Uxie and Azelf are likely identical or very similar to the odds of catching Shiny Mesprit, as all three Legendary Pokemon from Generation 4 were introduced at the same time in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  this past February.

  players in the Reddit community are really impressed with JuixyRaffle's catch, due to Shiny Mesprit's rarity. Although spawns have been boosted since Mesprit's debut in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , many players, including Reddit user psilocinkane, are still hoping to catch a Shiny Mesprit someday. Fortunately, it appears that some players have benefited from the spawn rate boost, with a few chiming in with their recent Mesprit and Uxie catches.

  The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Ultra Unlock: Strength of Steel event began this week and marked the debut of Shiny Togedemaru in the game. Strength of Steel's event bonuses are boosting overall XP gains and Candy drops, along with the encounter rate for the event's featured Pokemon. Similarly to Mesprit raid battles, raid battles featuring Togedemaru are more likely to produce a Shiny variant when compared to ordinary encounters in the wild. The new
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Adventure Week event will also have similar bonuses this August.

 <p>
  When traveling across The Lands Between in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  , there are a few special locations where the player can hear words spoken by Marika. Melina, the NPC who acts as the maiden guiding the player, can somehow channel echoes of Queen Marika and relay her words to the Tarnished at selected Sites of Grace. This allows the player to gain some insight into the history of the Golden Order, through Marika herself.

 <p>
  The words alone can still be quite cryptic, providing just enough to leave them open to interpretation. It is up to players to strengthen their understanding with other clues, but even then, some questions will never have a solid answer. There are seven spoken echoes, all revealing just a little more about the missing Queen of the Lands Between.

  Here, Marika addresses her husband Godfrey, and his warriors. She strips Godfrey and his followers of Grace, banishing them to a distant land where they will remain until death. Grace grants immortality, so taking this away before sending them to

  would likely be the death of many.

 <p>
  Following on from the previous echo, Marika makes a promise. She says she will return Grace to all Tarnished, promising the title of Elden Lord to those with the strength to claim it. Her words don't address Godfrey directly this time, as she returns Grace to every warrior who has become tarnished.

 <p>
  It is unclear how long Godfrey and the Tarnished were exiled. Marika remarried, the Elden Ring was later shattered, and unknown eons passed. Players even wonder if their character was one of the original Tarnished or a descendant, like Godfrey's own Nepheli Loux.

  <em>

  , which could mean a few different things. Perhaps some people were exiled, similar to Godfrey and the Tarnished. These, however, would have been the lucky ones.

 <p>
  Marika's expectations as a mother weighed heavily on her children and stepchildren. These words would likely spark their journeys to become who they were. All the children would reach for their mother's praise. Most aspired to be Lords, and those born as empyreans would aim for godhood.

 <p>
  Even Morgott, raised underground because of his Omen status, would become a beacon of a Golden Order that would never accept him. This pressure likely played a part in the many wars after The Shattering, with demigod siblings fighting each other for power.

  This echo confirms that Marika is indeed Radagon, just as the statue in Leyndell reveals. These may be the words spoken as Marika shattered the Elden Ring, implying her understanding of the consequences of this act.

 <p>
  It also questions when Radagon and Marika became one. It is not fully understood if Radagon can share the body of a god, but not be one himself. Certain details, like Messmer's red hair, may imply a different timeline than the one confirmed. Radagon's connection with Marika may have been much earlier.

 <p>
  Of all the people to doubt the Golden Order, Marika is probably the least expected. From these words, it appears as though she saw problems with the way that the faith was being practiced. This echo reveals her intent to shift from
  <em>
   blind belief
  </em>
  to true understanding.

 <p>
  This echo may provide a possible alternative to the reason for The Shattering. While many accept the fact that Godwyn's death was the sole cause, Marika probably wanted to change things for a long time. This also aligns with her plan to bring the Tarnished back to the Lands Between.

  Here, Marika speaks once again to Godfrey and his warriors. She commands them to
  <em>
   confine the flame
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  eliminating the threat of the Fell God's forge. This war is well recorded. Marika would purge the mountains, leaving one giant alive to watch the flame she was unable to extinguish.

 <p>
  This act would remove one of the main threats to the Erdtree, solidifying the Golden Order as a seat of power in the Lands Between. With the current state of things, it's difficult to imagine the Age of the Erdtree in its prime, but it was surely a sight to behold.

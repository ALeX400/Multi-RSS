      Side characters in
      <em>
       Legend of Zelda
      </em>
      , like King of Red Lions and Great Deku Tree, play vital roles in fleshing out the series' rich world.
     </li>
     <li>
      Characters like Tingle and Beedle, though polarizing, are important in providing key items and services to Link during his adventures.
     </li>
     <li>
      Iconic characters like Epona and Impa have made significant appearances in multiple
      <em>
       Zelda

      games, shaping the lore and storylines.

 <p>
  Although the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Legend of Zelda
   </strong>
  </em>
  series centers on the eponymous Princess Zelda and her stalwart companion and defender of the realm Link, there are many memorable and very important side-characters of Zelda who as well as being well-loved by fans, play important roles in the game series - sometimes even across several games.

 <p>
  Although these side characters can't hold a candle to the main characters of the series, they're well-loved and serve to flesh out the rich and expansive world of the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series in a major way.

 <p>
  The Great Deku Tree is a giant talking tree. That's cool already, but it's also a giant talking tree with massive relevance to the nation of Hyrule and the world of the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  game franchise. With appearances across the franchise, from mainline games such as
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  to spin-offs like
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland
  </em>
  , the Great Deku Tree is a stalwart of the franchise.

 <p>
  The Great Deku Tree is the guardian of the forest and takes care of the creatures that live within it, including the Kokiri or the Koroks. He even sets Link on his journey during
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Tingle is one of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  characters with the biggest polarizing reaction among fans. Some fans love Tingle and his unusual appearance and approach to life, while others hate him and wish he'd never existed as a character. So it would be a stretch to call him a beloved character.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1010} -->

 <p>
  But Tingle is quite important in some of the games in which he appears, and his character has even starred as a playable character in some
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  spin-off games too. Tingle is well known for selling important and useful maps and charts. So despite his polarizing personality and overall vibe, Tingle is absolutely one of the most important side characters in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series.

  Making his first appearance in
  <em>
   Wind Waker,
  </em>
  Beedle is a merchant who buys and sells many items, including quest items. Unlike some other merchants, Beedle doesn't stay in one place. Instead, he's a traveling character who can be encountered in many different locations in the games he appears in, making him a very useful merchant for Link on his journeys.

  Although at first Dampé seems like an ordinary old man with a slightly macabre job as a gravedigger, a little digging into his history and actions shows that he understands a lot more than he lets on. Dampé has a range of appearances, including in
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  . He even makes an appearance in
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  for the Nintendo Switch.

  The Postman is a recurring
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  character who is, not surprisingly, a postman. This guy is a postman with a difference, though, as he manages to get letters and other things delivered to Link in an astounding variety of locations - a bit like
  <em>
   Skyrim's
  </em>
  Courier.

 <p>
  The Postman has appeared in many different games in the

  franchise, sometimes with comic relief aspects and sometimes without. This guy is the real MVP, delivering letters and important items for quests to Link across the centuries without fail.

  Biggoron is exactly what his name suggests: he's a really big Goron. This giant Goron is a fun character to see pop up in a game, but he's more than just a neat cameo. Biggoron in most of his appearances allows Link to forge a powerful sword to use in his adventure.

  For a long time, Link had to just walk around everywhere. Across the whole of Hyrule, the Gerudo deserts, basically everywhere. Sure, there was the odd boat. But
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  was the first game that Link was able to get a leg up - literally - with a much-needed boost to his traveling speed.

  First encountered as a foal, Epona grew into a majestic horse and has made multiple appearances in

  games across the franchise. Although she doesn't say much - except in

   Twilight Princess

  where Wolf Link can speak with her - she's a stalwart companion for Link and literally carries the hero on her shoulders.

  Impa is arguably the single most important side character to make an appearance in a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game. To some, Impa may even be considered more than a side character given her many appearances. But Impa has an important role in many
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, including
  <em>
   Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Impa has been many things: a powerful Sage, a nursemaid to Princess Zelda, a warrior, and even a general in one appearance. Across her many incarnations, one thing has been true though: Impa is a person of importance not just to Princess Zelda, but to the entire kingdom of Hyrule.​​​​​​​

      <title>Wuthering Waves: Prism Heart Location &amp; How To Beat</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The Prism Heart is a surprisingly mighty foe in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  and aside from its general echo stats, it also manifests as a special/red enemy. If you thought the
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  overworld bosses were hard to fight, the red enemies scattered across the land certainly pose a threat. Currently, there are 20 special enemies and the Prism Heart is the only one at Level 90.

 <p>
  Since the Prism Heart enemy resides in packs, there are four of them that you have to beat to successfully fend them off. They easily outnumber you, so you’ll have to be strategic in your fight and be careful not to get hit.

  The Prism Heart gang is located in Dim Forest, near the Giant Banyan. It’s easier to reach it if you fast-travel to the
  <strong>
   Resonance Nexus in the area
  </strong>
  and head
  <strong>
   south
  </strong>
  on the map. Just keep heading straight and you’ll eventually see the four red spiky enemies in an open area.

  Since these are special enemies, they will always be level 90 regardless of your level, and so you need to make sure your characters are built well enough to last through the fight. The only way you can beat them is by dealing with them
  <strong>
   individually
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  instead of as a group. If you fight them as a group, they will overpower you and it will be difficult to come out of it alive.

  The way to do this isn’t that easy and may take a few tries as enemies in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  are alerted pretty easily when you step into their 10ft radar. You’ll need to attract their attention and lure them away into a more stable open area since they will be near a cliff.

  Remember to then slowly approach an individual Prism Heart,
  <strong>
   without drawing the attention

  of the remaining ones in the area, and defeat it first before moving on to the next. Once you have defeated one of them, heal up, rinse, and repeat with the remaining three.

      <title>5 Hardest Borderlands Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/hardest-borderlands-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  When the first
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game was released in 2009, it broke the FPS mold in a myriad of ways. In a time when every shooter felt like a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  clone focused on representing realistic warfare,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  chose to do something different. It was a risk that paid off and Borderlands' cel-shaded graphics, scatological sense of humor, and looter-shooter mechanics earned it a legion of loyal fans.

 <p>
  Much like deciding which is the best Borderlands game, choosing the hardest entry in the franchise is largely a matter of opinion. The series has evolved a lot over the years, and each game features different mechanics, character classes, and progression systems. Later games have also put greater emphasis on super-difficult post-game content and modes. For this list, we're ranking the games based mainly on the experience of playing through the main storyline, and side quests, while taking into account the differences between playing solo and with friends.

  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  might be a
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  -flavored spin-off, but it carries pretty much all the hallmarks of a
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game. Generally speaking, the game was well received by both fans and critics, but there were a handful of things its inevitable sequel can improve upon, one of which is the game's difficulty. In making the game more solo-player-friendly and story-focused, the developers dialed back the difficulty to the point where certain parts of the game became a cakewalk.

 <p>
  For example, thanks to the game's fantasy setting, grenades were ditched in favor of spells. Some of these spells can be insanely overpowered, even if the player's build isn't magic-focused. Likewise, a heightened emphasis on melee builds makes running around and simply smacking enemies to death easier than ever. On the one hand, the lessened difficulty makes
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  the most approachable title in the series, but on the other, seasoned players likely won't feel challenged until they reach the endgame content, like the Chaos Chambers.

 <p>
  Despite its lower ranking, the original
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , one of the best "apunkalypse" games ever made, can still be plenty difficult. There are no sections with AI-controlled allies to help the player out, the gunplay is much more basic (and arguably requires more skill), and in general, there are fewer systems that hold the player's hand. However, the original's relative simplicity is also what arguably makes it easier than later games.

 <p>
  For a start, there is a lot less to keep track of. The player doesn't need to worry about building an optimized character or juggling ever-more complicated systems. Instead, they just need to pick the gun that has the highest numbers attached to it and kill what the game tells them to kill. This is made easier by the fact that there's not that much enemy variety and the enemy AI is less aggressive than in later games. The game also lacks its sequels' level scaling and advanced difficulty modes. This means that as long as the player makes sure to keep tackling side missions and quests, it's surprisingly easy to become over-leveled. Once that happens, ignoring group-focused content like Crawmerax, the rest of the game is a total breeze.

  Ranking
  <em>

  based on its difficulty isn't easy. Playing through the storyline and side quests the first time around really isn't all that hard. The story has plenty of set pieces where allies help the player out, and the game adds alternate fire modes and weapon abilities that can make your character feel much stronger than in earlier games.
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  is also much more generous when it comes to handing out rare loot, and it's much easier to make a good build.

  The sheer abundance of content also means it is easier than ever before to out-level the story missions and feel overpowered. However, some of this is canceled out by the improved enemy AI and more dynamic combat encounters. The game also has some of Borderlands' best boss fights, and bosses like Rampager and Tyreen demand quick reflexes and precise shooting to take down. Of course, the elephant in the room is Mayhem Mode. We said earlier that we wouldn't talk about post-game modes too much, but Mayhem Mode is too big a part of
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  to ignore. It ups the difficulty significantly by enhancing enemy strength and adding random modifiers. Without the proper preparation and a ton of grinding, the higher levels feel downright insurmountable. Oddly, this means
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  can simultaneously seem like one of the easiest and hardest
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games, landing it mid-ranking.

  made a handful of additions to the franchise formula that make it just a little harder than other entries in the franchise. Chief among these are its low-gravity environments and oxygen management system, both of which add a welcome layer of complexity to both combat and exploration. The altered physics can impact both movement and aiming, making it harder to land critical hits and dodge certain enemies' attacks. While the oxygen system was never too grueling, it added something else to worry about in the heat of battle, especially during drawn-out firefights.

  Many fans of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  believe the franchise peaked with
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  . Its story was a big step up from the original, and it introduced a ton of gameplay improvements while avoiding some of the problems that plague
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . It's easily one of the best looter-shooters ever made, and it is just as fun to play now as it was over ten years ago. But that's not to say the game's perfect. Its difficulty can be a problem, especially for solo players.

  For a start, the game's enemies scale aggressively with the player's level, which means the player rarely gets to feel overpowered. This is made worse by the fact that certain enemy types are annoyingly spongy, while others, like the constructor, are nearly always a pain to deal with. Some encounters throw so many powerful enemies at the player at once that it's easy for solo players to be left overwhelmed, especially when some enemies can almost one-shot the player through their shields.
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  also has some of the franchise's most difficult bosses, many of whom have insane health pools, punishing attacks, and a nasty habit of spawning extra enemies. Finally, the game's skills trees and character classes allow for a ton of experimentation, which is great. Unfortunately, all the synergies aren't always that clear, and creating an optimized character can be a daunting task. Poorly designed builds, especially with some classes, can mean the player is left struggling towards the game's end and in the more difficult areas of the DLCs, especially Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Difficulty may be subjective, but these factors mean
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  gets the top ranking here, and that's without mentioning the horrors of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.

  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  , developed by Riot Games, is a tactical first-person shooter that was officially launched on June 2, 2020, after a highly successful beta phase. The game quickly gained prominence in the competitive gaming scene, thanks to its blend of precise gunplay and unique character abilities, appealing to both casual and professional players. A key factor in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  's continued success is its regular updates, which consistently introduce new content and gameplay tweaks.
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  is organized into Episodes and Acts, with each Episode bringing significant changes, such as new agents, maps, and mechanics, ensuring a dynamic and evolving experience for its player base.

  In addition to major updates,
  <em>

  receives minor patches focused on enhancing quality of life, balancing, and bug fixes. The latest, patch 9.03, includes several refinements. One significant improvement addresses interactions with overlapping objects, making actions like attaching to ropes more reliable even when obstructed by other elements, such as Cypher’s Spycam darts. Adjustments have also been made to the ground-spreading abilities of
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  's agents, like Brimstone’s Incendiary and Viper's Snakebite, to ensure their effects spread more consistently and align with their visual indicators. Moreover, map-targeted abilities now feature additional icons on the minimap, enhancing targeting accuracy for abilities such as Brimstone’s Sky Smoke and Omen’s From The Shadows.

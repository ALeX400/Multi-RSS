  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
   </em>
  </strong>
  was greenlit in part because of Konami's growing concern that younger gamers are no longer familiar with its iconic franchise, a senior company official said. This revelation expands on the previously shared story about how the
  <em>
   MGS 3: Snake Eater
  </em>
  remake came to be.

 <p>
  Back in May 2023, Konami said that it was open to remaking more
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  games after
  <em>
   MGS Delta
  </em>
  . On that occasion, a company representative revealed that Konami decided to start with
  <em>
   Snake Eater
  </em>
  rather than
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  due to popular demand.

 <p>
  But popular demand wasn't the only thing that prompted Konami to consider
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  remakes in the first place. Another contributing factor was the growing concern that the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  series was declining in popularity. That's according to series producer Noriaki Okamura, who suggested as much in a recent interview with the UK magazine
  <em>
   Play
  </em>
  (via GamesRadar). "​​A lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  series anymore," Okamura explained, stating that this realization was one of the factors that "really sparked" the team's desire to tackle the upcoming remake.

  MGS Delta: Snake Eater Won't Just Cater to Fans of the Original
 </h2>
 <p>
  Given this state of affairs,
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
  </em>
  will both cater to fans of the original and simultaneously try to appeal to new audiences. Since
  <em>
   Snake Eater
  </em>
  is about to turn 20 on November 17, there's an entire generation of people who most likely never got a chance to experience it. Even the latest mainline entry in the series,
  <em>
   MGS5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , is pushing 10 nowadays, so the franchise is overdue a new big-budget game if it wants to ensure it stays relevant moving forward.

  MGS Delta's Name Reflects Its Appeal to Old and New Fans Alike
 </h3>
 <p>
  This desire to appeal to both old and new fans contributed to Konami's decision to title the remake
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
  </em>
  rather than retaining the original name. As Okamura explains it,
  <em>
   Snake Eater
  </em>
  is chronologically the first entry in the franchise, so between that and the fact that it's the first
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  game to get the remake treatment, it made sense not to attach any numbers to it.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   MGS Delta: Snake Eater
  </em>
  was initially rumored for a late 2024 debut, it is still without a release date or even an official release window as of November. Therefore, the remake currently seems unlikely to hit the market until the first half of 2025 at the earliest.

      Ellen's rerun will debut alongside the release of two new S-Rank characters to Zenless Zone Zero, including highly-anticipated Ice character Hoshimi Miyabi.

  Recent leaks from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  are hinting at the first rerun banner set to arrive to the urban action RPG, suggesting that S-Rank character Ellen will return in Version 1.4. The first few updates from HoYoverse's newest game have introduced a wide variety of characters to the game's roster, expanding on old factions and adding new ones. Factions like the Sons of Calydon and Section 6 have seen new characters like Caesar and Yanagi, while entirely new factions like Public Security have brought fan-favorites like Qingyi and Jane. Now, a beloved character is set to make her return.

 <p>
  S-Rank character Ellen Joe debuted in Version 1.0 as
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's first limited character, featured on the gacha banner with the game's launch. Ellen quickly won over fans with her laid-back and nonchalant attitude, playing a major role in the Victoria Housekeeping chapter of the game's main story. Ellen has also commonly been seen as one of the game's most powerful DPS characters since her release, often paired alongside characters like Lycaon and Soukaku. A leak now suggests new players may soon be able to add Ellen to their teams.

 <p>
  A new leak shared by prominent HoYoverse leaker Dim is teasing the arrival of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's first rerun banner in Version 1.4. According to the post, Version 1.4 will feature Ellen as the game's first rerun banner, with no confirmation about whether she would be featured during the first or second half of the update. An Ellen rerun would also likely feature the return of Ellen's signature W-Engine, Deep Sea Visitor, to the limited banner. Version 1.4 of
  <em>

  is currently expected to launch on December 18.

 <p>
  Ellen's return to the limited gacha banner is expected to arrive alongside another Ice character that has been one of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's most highly-anticipated units. HoYoverse recently confirmed S-Rank character Hoshimi Miyabi will release during the Version 1.4 update as an Ice Anomaly character. Miyabi is expected to debut as a damage-oriented character, likely competing with Ellen for her position as a DPS unit in Ice-focused teams. Version 1.4 will also welcome the release of another member of Section 6 with S-Rank unit Asaba Harumasa.

 <p>
  Ellen's rerun banner in Version 1.4 will follow similar trends with HoYoverse's past RPGs seeing old characters return.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  featured its first rerun banner with the release of Version 1.4, with Seele returning during the second half of the update.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's first rerun also came with its Version 1.4 update, finally allowing players to pick up popular support character and Anemo Archon Venti again.
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's first rerun will likely foreshadow the return of fan-favorite characters like Zhu Yuan and Qingyi in the near future.

  The Tanto .22 punches way above its weight, pushing much further than many of the other submachine guns in terms of power. This is due to the fact that its damage is competitive against many assault rifles while having all of the mobility benefits of a submachine gun.

 <p>
  The gun intrinsically has good hip fire, and has its fire rate increased with Pack-a-Punch, making it a decent offhand gun that can still get used when not aimed. It also has really good stability, making the attachments that detract from that stat, like Rapid Fire and the CHF Barrel much more bearable.

 <p>
  Most of the Assault Rifles are usable for early-mid rounds of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies
  </em>
  , but the AK-74 pushes a bit further than the rest. This is thanks to the fact that it has incredibly high critical hit damage. At full auto, the only Assault Rifle that comes close is the Model-L, which has the same damage output but with an 8% worse fire rate in exchange for better stability.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This makes the AK-74 a really easy weapon to use and build around, with rapid-fire being a viable option for players who can handle the recoil and want a higher damage-per-second, and many stability perks making the weapon in line with others of the same archetype for those who find the weapon a little hard to wield. While no wonder weapon, this gun can push into the high 30s before it starts to slow down and is incredibly good on ammo thanks to having a slower fire rate.

 <p>
  So this entry has some caveats, and that's for two reasons: This weapon shouldn't be used as a conventional weapon, and this weapon cannot have attachments put on it. Because of this, the Cigma 2B players spawn in with will be the same as any Cigma 2B that they get their hands on in the field. However, spawning in with one does guarantee that players have the weapon, and can save a lot of money that would be spent trying to get the weapon from the Mystery Box.

 <p>
  For the other caveat, this weapon is not good on ammo, and as a result, is less useful as a main weapon. However, what this weapon does do very well is buy space. Absurd damage and the ability to fire in full-auto when Pack-a-Punched make this weapon an extremely useful tool for getting out in a pinch when things go south. Pair this weapon with PHD Flopper to avoid self-inflicted explosive damage, and the Frenzy Fire trait for Frenzied Guard which makes weapons fire from reserves, and players can empty a dozen rockets in a matter of seconds.

 <p>
  The Shock Charge is probably one of the best pieces of equipment in the game, and this is because it has both incredible defensive and offensive power. Defensively, the shock stick stops any enemy that walks into its radius, and most importantly, does not affect the player. It's faster to deploy than decoy grenades, and players can hold three of them. One button press is all it takes to stun all of the zombies around players, and they get stunned for a great bit too.

 <p>
  Offensively, these stun all enemies; even Elite enemies like Amalgamations and Abominations. This means that many of the game's spongier enemies can be held in place, allowing for weapons that rely on critical hits ample time to dish out damage uncontested.

 <p>
  The SWAT 5.56 is a mix between a Sniper Rifle and an Assault Rifle, taking the best elements of both classes with few of the downsides. Its defining feature is its headshot damage, which is insane, not showing signs of slowing till the rounds reach the early 40s.

 <p>
  The weapon needs a little help with its slow sprint-to-fire, but its movement speed is fantastic for the amount of damage it does, making it better than assault rifles in terms of damage but just as fast. It's simple and reliable.

 <p>
  No, that's not a typo. The SVD, when Pack-a-Punched, turns into the best shotgun in the game, easily beating out the Marine SP and the ASG-89. This weapon has incredible range, does insane damage against bosses, and still has great hip-fire for clearing basic zombies. Building around sprint-to-fire and mobility can be great, but even with a scope the weapon is incredibly useful, allowing for long-range take-downs, or the ability to chip away at Manglers while staying well ahead of the horde.

 <p>
  Because the attachments help it lean more into being a shotgun, or more into being a sniper, there is a lot of reason to tweak this gun before players drop, as opposed to just grabbing it from the Mystery Box.

 <p>
  The LW3A1 Frostline Sniper is a ridiculous weapon when Pack-a-Punched, firing as fast as a Marksman Rifle while doing significantly more damage. On top of increased rechambering speed, the weapon also gains increased aim-down-sight speed, allowing it to still find use even after round 41 hits and the game starts spawning Super Sprinters.

 <p>
  This weapon is one of the best weapons to use against bosses, just because of how fast it can dish out critical damage. Pair this with the aforementioned Shock Charge, and it's easy to dispose of Elites before their stun animation even ends.

 <p>
  This weapon is not only one of the best weapons a player can bring in but also one of the best weapons a player can use in Zombies. It's damage output, ammo economy, and explosive damage when Pack-a-Punched puts even the Ray Gun to shame, and it can be brought into the game from Round 1. This weapon basically has it all; explosive damage to destroy armor faster, high precision damage for bosses and Elites, customizability in the form of attachments, and compatibility with Ammo Mods.

 <p>
  With ammo that costs 5,000 Essence instead of the Ray Gun's 10,000 Essence, and the ability to kill more zombies with less, it really isn't a surprise that this weapon is as powerful as it is. This weapon can also be used against normal zombies completely in hip-fire, obliterating Super Sprinters without even needing to aim. And while this gun isn't as consistent with boss damage as the LW3A1 Frostline, the LR 7.62 makes incredible companions with just about any gun, be they focused on critical damage like the Frostline or focused on horde-thinning like the Thrustodyne M23.

   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3

  Every choice players make during character customization, from the class to the background, will influence what skills the character has proficiency in. There are eighteen skills available, and each character can only be proficient in a few. With that in mind, these are by far the best skills a player should be proficient in that will help them in their future explorations.

      Baldur's Gate 3 is a long game, and every skill comes in handy at one point or another. This list has been updated to include additional entries, while also giving some best class options for each skill to make sure you get the most out of them. While most skills are good in just about any class, the listed best classes will get just a bit more use out of them depending on your build.

  Nature can be a fairly useful skill to get, though its uses do vary throughout the game. During Act 1 of the game, you'll be working alongside a tribe of Druids out in the wilds, while also delving into the Underdark. Both of these areas are rich with Nature and that skill comes in great use during these early sections.

 <p>
  While this skill isn't useless in later sections of the game, its uses do waver in favor of other skills found further on this list. Act 2 also takes decent advantage of this skill, though it's not as much of a skill that gets you out of bad situations as it is giving you more knowledge on a situation to approach a solution more knowledgeable.

  Performance can be seen as a bit of a silly skill used by Bards to distract people, and that's not always far from the truth. Performance has some checks that are mostly meant for humor, though it does have some situations where you'll need to convince someone with your actions over words, and that's where performance comes in.

 <p>
  Performance can also be used by those who can play an instrument to make a crowd happy and make the party some gold safely in a town. There are also a few situations where a good performance check can help you avoid difficult combat encounters, making it a good option for those who like solving problems without fighting.

 <p>
  Religion plays a large role throughout Faerun, especially if you have Shadowheart in your party and are pursuing her storyline. Even avoiding Shadowheart's story, the game will bring you face to face with many aspects of religion, especially in Act 2, and having the Religion skills can be a huge benefit.

 <p>
  Unlike some skills on this list, Religion can be useful throughout the game, and can even be used to get details of later story elements by passing the right checks during Act 1.

  Faerun is home to many wonderful beasts and animals, such as Owlbears, Displacer Beasts, dogs, cats, bears, and plenty more. Animal lovers can befriend many of these adorable creatures, and those with Speak to Animals can even go a step further and speak to them.

  But for those unable to communicate, the Animal Handling skill is the next best thing. It is a judge of how well they can communicate to animals with gestures and actions rather than words, and how well the animals will receive this method of communication. Clever use of this skill allows players to recruit animals such as Scratch or the Owlbear cub to their camp.

  While some players may consider History boring or lackluster in the real world, History in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  can give players much-needed context when exploring the world around them. Characters that are proficient in History, an Intelligence-based skill, are more likely to recall events from the past that they have learned about.

 <p>
  This can help a player understand some encounters that can occur. For example, in Act One, the player can step foot into a ruined temple. With proficiency in History, the player is likely to learn that this temple was once for a god that is no longer worshiped in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  .

  While exploring in
  <em>
   BG3,
  </em>
  players are likely to encounter various mysteries they may need to look into. Being proficient in Investigation will help players when they are searching for clues in these situations. A player may still be able to come to a solution without this Intelligence-based skill, but they are far more likely to succeed if they are proficient.

  Investigation may appear that it wouldn't be used very often, but like History, it can add context to certain scenarios. Uncovering clues before reaching danger is sure to make some players feel as if they have prepared themselves for the possible fight ahead.

  Throughout their travels, players might meet many people wounded or sick, as the world of myth and magic is not immune to everyday mundanities such as illnesses. This is where the Medicine skill will find most of its uses, as it aids players in diagnosing and treating.

  This can result in saving the lives of others in more drastic scenarios, such as companions who have fallen in battle. Companions who have been downed can be stabilized with a good enough Medicine skill check, allowing players to bring them back into the fight at a more appropriate time.

  Any player can crouch and try to stay hidden, but those who are proficient in Stealth can even hide in plain sight. Stealth, which is connected to the Dexterity attribute, is arguably one of the best skills for a player to be proficient in as it goes a lot further than being used for criminal means.

  Players can ambush their opponents by sneaking into the room they find themselves in and getting to the upper ground. Like Persuasion, being skilled in Stealth can also allow the player to avoid fights entirely as they easily sneak past dangerous foes that may easily dispatch the player and their party.

 <p>
  Dexterity is an attribute that many classes are likely to have a high score in, especially those that take part in ranged combat such as Rangers. When it comes to skills governed by Dexterity, players should focus their proficiency on Acrobatics. Characters that are proficient in this are likely to land on their feet during agile moments. What's more, it is incredibly useful in combat.

 <p>
  An aspect of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is being shoved while in a battle. If a player leaves themselves open to this, they are likely to fall to their death. Thankfully, those proficient in Acrobatics are less likely to be pushed over as they remain steadfast.

 <p>
  Combat isn't the only place where proficiencies are important, and this Wisdom-based skill is a prime example. When engaging in conversations with NPCs, a player may find themselves listening to a lie. With a high score in Insight, the game's narrator will let the player know if the individual they are talking to appears nervous, or seems as if they are hiding something.

 <p>
  Moments like this can open more options in the dialogue that players may have never encountered otherwise. This can go even further than conversations. In certain situations, the Insight skill can, for example, alert the player that they are about to walk into a trap.

  Athletics is the only skill connected to the Strength attribute; the only other thing this attribute is used for is used for melee weapons. However, this skill is still incredibly useful in combat, with a similar role to that of Acrobatics.

 <p>
  Once again players are better defended against being shoved when they are proficient in Athletics. Apart from this, the skill also helps the player when shoving their opponents. This means the enemy gets a taste of their own medicine of being thrown to their deaths when they get too close to the edge.

  Players might think it is overkill to have two Charisma-focused skills for the sake of persuading or scaring the opposing party to get their own way, but it is always useful to have a backup. Persuasion is often championed as the only diplomatic skill a party could need, but sometimes, the honey approach doesn't always work, and then they need to pull out the vinegar.

 <p>
  Also, diplomacy could be beneficial in a role-playing sense as well, as it may be more befitting for their character to try and intimidate others than Persuade. Even if not, it is always a good idea to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.

  Magic plays a large role in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , and therefore knowing about the schools of magic and their effects can be extremely helpful. A player should consider being proficient in Arcana, or at least have a decent modifier attached to it. With the help of Arcana, a player can detect magical presences, such as a tome masquerading as something. This skill can even help them receive further context in some situations.

 <p>
  Players will be surprised how often Arcana shows up in the various dialogue options they encounter on their adventure. This skill's utility makes it vital to have for any worthy Wizard or other spellcaster.

  Of all the skills available in
  <em>

  , no matter what class a player has chosen, they should always be proficient in the Wisdom-based skill Perception. This is one of the most important skills in the game, as it allows the player to be aware of their surroundings at all times.

 <p>
  Perception can come in handy in many situations. With successful checks, players may notice small details of the environment that could reveal a secret. It can also come up in moments in conversation' for example, if a character is attempting to distract the player while they get pickpocketed.

 <p>
  While Sleight of Hand may sound like quite the nefarious skill to be proficient in, it's vital when exploring the world of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3,
  </em>
  and not just for players with nefarious goals. Although it can be used to pick the pockets of any NPC the player passes, an adventurer is more likely to use it when unlocking chests or disarming traps.

 <p>
  A player should always be putting their party first. Locked chests could be filled with all sorts of valuable loot that players may either equip or sell, so they're worth breaking into. Some of these chests may also be trapped as well as locked, which will need to be dealt with before a player dares to unlock it and examine what's inside.

 <p>
  Being charismatic is almost as essential as being able to battle in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3.
  </em>
  Many dangerous or unpleasant situations can be avoided if the player knows how to use their words. Persuasion is one of many skills connected to the Charisma attribute, though it will likely be the one that's used the most.

 <p>
  Players can use their powers of persuasion to get NPCs to look the other way during certain scenarios, or give them information without ever needing to hand a single gold coin over. Sometimes the easiest solution to a problem is just talking it out.

  Game Rant recently spoke with
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  season 2 executive music producer Alexander Seaver, a prominent composer in both seasons of the show, about the songs on the Netflix show that highlight prominent storytelling moments and the importance of season 2's large track number.

 <p>
  When reflecting back on the success of
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  's first season, Seaver mentioned that getting artists to work on the show was a challenge in and of itself since the TV show didn't properly exist yet. It was hard to explain the idea of taking the artists' songs and working with them to put them into an, at the time, unknown animation. Ultimately, of course, the show and music would go on to be considered a classic in the making by critics.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":953} -->

 <p>
  With that success behind them, Seaver mentioned that the exact opposite of season 1's struggle arose. Several artists asked if there was anything they could do for season 2 and said they'd be completely down to be a part of Fortiche's project. As great as this was when it came to allowing the musical segments of
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  to thrive between seasons after its use of musical storytelling was highly praised, it was a matter of making sure these moments stuck out for storytelling value rather than including more music for the sake of it. As Seaver explained to Game Rant,
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":569} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There are a couple of changes. The first thing I want to point out—I’m so curious to see what people think when they see the show because we have twice as many songs this time—is that we wanted to make sure that the genesis of how we created these was exactly the same as season 1, which is about supporting the storytelling. We don't have flashy music moments to be like, “Check out this song that we're going to promote." Every bit of music is in there because it supports the storytelling, and it’s what our team, like Christian and Fortiche, want.
  </p>

 <p>
  Many of the songs in
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  are written to match animations and help tell the story on-screen through music rather than have the show be produced the other way around. This meant Seaver and the other musicians working on the hit show looked at how the story unfolded, even in a rough form, and took that for inspiration behind the tracks they'd create down to even the beats per minute.

 <p>
  It's important to remember that many of the songs in
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  exist for the characters and their perspectives, even as season 2 has its soundtrack stuffed to the brim. For Seaver, season 2 led to many opportunities for him to explore Caitlyn, where season 1 kept him inside Jinx's head for the most part. These songs and their presence in the animation are so important that Seaver admits to even making last-minute changes before the season's release. It's an intricate, but worthwhile process that requires an understanding team, and that's exactly what
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  has in its corner according to Seaver.

   There's like a million ways that this could not work, and for whatever reason, it does. I think it really is the people. It’s just the team, like the spirit is out of this world.

I just can't say enough about how great that family is that's working on it.

 <p>
  Between his many projects at Riot Games such as "Legends Never Die" and "Phoenix,"
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  sits as such a special project to Seaver. In fact, he avoided watching the final animation that he didn't supervise himself, instead preferring to see how the story unfolds just as he did for season 1.
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  has won many hearts through its music and characters, both internally within the project and out, and it's Seaver's hope that fans enjoy the rest of the musical journey as it releases throughout the month.

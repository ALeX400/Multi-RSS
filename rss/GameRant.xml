      <title>Enotria Borrows One of Dark Souls 2's Most Frustrating Aspects</title>

  The recent release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  into the continually growing Soulslike genre was always bound to draw plenty of comparisons to the work of FromSoftware. Interestingly enough, the game tends to stick more to the playbook of the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy rather than other FromSoftware games like
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , despite its heavy emphasis on the parry-centric combat of the former. Thanks to its somewhat stiff movements and animation,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  is garnering plenty of nods to the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , but its enemy placements and emphasis on group encounters share more in common with the series' "black sheep":
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  .

  The original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  forces the player into plenty of situations where they're threatened by multiple enemies but switches gears to a greater focus on challenging, one-on-one encounters in its latter half (beginning with reaching Anor Londo). Conversely,
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  resorts to delivering challenges to the player through sheer volume, placing plenty of ambushes and gank mobs in the player's path. These enemies are weak and easy to deal with individually, but facing them as a group proved to be incredibly frustrating.
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  commits a similar misstep with its enemy placements, and it, unfortunately, draws an unfavorable comparison to
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  because of it.

  It doesn't take long before
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's encounters begin proper, with the game's introduction wasting little time before letting players dive into things headfirst. In just the first area of the game, the player finds themselves not challenged by single enemies but instead groups around just about every corner. Considering the game places a strong emphasis on parrying and singularly focused encounters, these group fights quickly go from tense to frustrating before the game has even had time to properly endear itself to players.

 <p>
  The greatest offenders aren't the melee fighters but instead, the enemies that use ranged weapons like crossbows or throw exploding grenades containing one of
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's many elemental effects. On their own, these enemies are weak and will often go down in a single hit. Taken together with foes that get right up in the player's face for an exchange of blows, though, they become one of the deadliest obstacles on the battlefield. None of these enemies have much health and are easily dispatched, but the constant interrupting of attacks by ranged blows from enemy mobs makes that easier said than done.

 <p>
  Fighting multiple enemies at once is a common Soulslike challenge and one to be expected, but the degree to which
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  leans on this mechanic gives it a somewhat unfavorable comparison to one of the worst aspects of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  . This is made all the worse thanks to the game's emphasis on parrying over dodging, with the dodge mechanic not nearly as useful in tense situations and the parry mechanic impossible after having an attack interrupted by taking damage from an off-screen enemy.
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's dodge mechanic is arguably more useful than, say,
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  's, but it still takes a backseat to parrying.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  fails to provide many challenging individual encounters outside of boss battles. Instead, the game relies on throwing numbers at the player to overwhelm them, and in many ways, it succeeds. This is a disservice to the game's combat, though, because when
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  is firing on all cylinders it feels incredibly satisfying to parry, riposte, and Unravel foes. It's just a shame that, for many encounters, players will be actively seeking out ranged cannon fodder before locking into an engaging battle.

  . While the costumes for the other party members are carried over from the base game or purchased through DLC, Metis' costumes are earned through Elizabeth Requests, which are one of the many changes from The Answer.

  Much like the Elizabeth Requests from the base game, many of them will be focused on fusing specific Personas. While there are easier fusion requests that focus only on level or a skill on any Persona, those requiring a specific skill on a specific Persona require a bit more work to complete. Request 23 is one of these more difficult requests; here's how to complete it. This article is also written without the DLC Personas factored in.

  This request is the point when fusion requests become much more difficult, as Succubus can be obtained through many methods but only one will guarantee her knowing Charm Boost. Other methods will be listed below, though Charm Boost isn't a skill card to be found, and those other options can be checked just in case one of the base Personas you have does already have Charm Boost.

  As her name implies, the main appeal of Succubus is her ability to charm foes with Sexy Dance, which she knows inherently. Charm Boost greatly increases the odds of this ability to succeed, making this an overall very useful fusion request.

      <title>Injustice Getting a Third Game Would Have One Upside a New Mortal Kombat Wouldn’t</title>

  Developer NetherRealm fell into a fairly regular pattern with its video game releases in the 2010s. 2011's
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  brought the franchise back in full force, and the groundwork laid by it was used just two years later for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Injustice: Gods Among Us
   </strong>
  </em>
  , a fighting game centered around the DC universe. In 2015, NetherRealm released
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat X
  </em>
  , which continued to refine and add to the studio's fighting game formula, and just like the first entry did before it,
  <em>
   Injustice 2
  </em>
  carried that formula forward in 2017. But when
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  released in 2019, no third
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  entry followed it.

 <p>
  Instead,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  was followed by last year's
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . However, since
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's release, NetherRealm's Chief Creative Officer, Ed Boon, has teased a new
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  entry a few times. In an interview with The Direct back in July, Boon stated that he "would be surprised if [NetherRealm] never did [
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  ] again." This is far from an official confirmation that
  <em>
   Injustice 3
  </em>
  is in the works, but it does suggest that it's only a matter of time. And when
  <em>
   Injustice 3
  </em>
  does launch, it could come with one big advantage that
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  doesn't get.

  All the way back in January 2013, just a few months before the game's launch, an
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  comic hit digital storefronts. Written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by Jheremy Raapack, this first issue of
  <em>
   Injustice: Gods Among Us
  </em>
  was just the start in a surprisingly long run of comics set in the video game's distinct version of the DC universe.

 <p>
  Over the course of three years, five separate volumes of the
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  comic were produced, each one detailing a year in the
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  timeline.
  <em>
   Injustice: Year One
  </em>
  sees Joker killing Lois Lane and driving Superman to madness.
  <em>
   Year Two
  </em>
  sees Superman take on the Green Lantern Corps.
  <em>
   Year Three
  </em>
  introduces magic-users like Doctor Fate and Constantine and sees them joining the growing Insurgency led by Batman.
  <em>
   Year Four
  </em>
  shows Ares using the ongoing conflict between the Regime and the Insurgency to gain power, and
  <em>
   Year Five
  </em>
  has Batman and Lex Luthor trying to contact a different universe for aid, leading directly into the events of the first
  <em>

  </em>
  video game.

  In the lead-up to
  <em>
   Injustice 2
  </em>
  's May 2017 release date, DC published another handful of comics based on the video game series. Running from December 2016 to July 2017, DC released
  <em>
   Injustice: Ground Zero
  </em>
  , a comic that retold the events of the first game from Harley Quinn's perspective. A prequel comic that filled in the gap between
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  and its sequel, simply titled
  <em>
   Injustice 2
  </em>
  , also ran from April 2017 to October 2018.

  The most recent

  comic series is its most bizarre, with
  <em>
   Injustice vs. Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  running from September 2018 to March 2019. This comic takes place after
  <em>

  's Superman ending, where the Man of Steel reforges his Regime. To try and stop Superman, Batman and the Insurgency recruit He-Man and the rest of the Masters of the Universe.

 <p>
  While the
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  comics have their slower moments, they've generally been worthwhile reads for fans of NetherRealm's fighting games, fleshing out the world and characters a bit more thoroughly than the games' story modes. If/when
  <em>
   Injustice 3
  </em>
  happens, it would be great to see another comic run revolving around NetherRealm's bleak DC universe, with the developer using it as a way to fill in some story gaps between entries.

  Starter Pokemon are an essential piece of any
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  title, but the greatly-anticipated and equally mysterious
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Legends Z-A
   </em>
  </strong>
  , set to release sometime next year, has especially stirred up a lot of discussion regarding starters. With 2022's
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  offering a sort of mash-up of starter Pokemon that originate from different regions throughout the fantasy world, it seems like anything is possible in its upcoming sequel. There are many competing theories that suggest why certain favorites from the past may appear in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter pool, and there's a case for Bulbasaur to return as the game's Grass-type starter.

  With
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  ' starter roster consisting of Gen 2's Cyndaquil, Gen 5's Oshawott, and Gen 7's Rowlet, many fans believe that
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is likely to include starters from a variety of other generations throughout the franchise's history. Even so, exceedingly little is known about
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  just yet. It's possible, if quite unlikely, that
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  could introduce a whole new trio of starters rather than continue the tradition that
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  began. Whatever the case,
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  's many homages to the original Gen 1 titles strongly suggest that the classic Kanto trio will make a return one way or another in the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  game.

  fans who have seen just about everything the Kalos region has to offer are likely to recall the many Gen 1 throwbacks, from the post-game battles against Kanto's legendary Pokemon to the ability to choose a second, Gen 1-exclusive starter a few hours into the game. Not only did
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  allow players to choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle yet again, it even distributed 4 different mega forms among them - a treatment that not even the game's native starters received.

  The Case For Venusaur to Get Its Own Regional Variant
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though any of the original three could realistically appear as a starter option in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , there's a unique case for Bulbasaur. While Charizard is notorious for its popularity in more recent titles, one could argue that Bulbasaur is due some time in the spotlight instead, and Kalos could be the perfect place for that to happen. France is known for various species of popular flowers, and so there's plenty of potential for really any Grass-type Pokemon to receive some beautiful new regional variants.

 <p>
  With Bulbasaur's evolutions already featuring flowers as part of their designs, it seems most fitting for its species to receive such a regional variant, perhaps making use of the Fairy-type that was introduced in Gen 6. That said, it does seem unlikely for Bulbasaur to appear without the other Gen 1 starters, especially considering that each of them received Mega Evolutions in the Gen 6 titles. With Mega Evolution set to return to the core-series
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, any and all Mega Pokemon could well come back in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  .

  Alternatively, all three of the Kanto starter Pokemon might appear in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  independently of the primary starter group if
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  intends to retain the Kalos region's links to Kanto. These iconic Pokemon may just be essential to the completion of the game's Pokedex and might be catchable in the world similar to the Sinnoh region's starters in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  .

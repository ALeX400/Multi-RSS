  With the new 1.0 version of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  mod, sm64coopdx, players can enjoy up to 16-player co-op and additional characters who were never in the original. Even though it's been nearly 30 years since the original launch, fans are still finding ways to add to
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  via mods.

 <p>
  <em>
   Super Mario 64 Co-Op Deluxe,
  </em>
  originally called sm64coopdx, began as a project spearheaded by two separate teams before joining together to be Coop Deluxe Team nearly six months ago. In the project's six months of development, new features, quality-of-life changes, and more have been added to allow more people to enjoy
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  . Complete with a new day and night cycle, the graphics are completely overhauled with all-new functionality implemented with Lua. The mod will likely help make the already widely popular N64 game even more appealing to players.

 <p>
  The newest version of
  <em>
   Super Mario 64 Co-Op Deluxe
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  adds new additions to the game, including a new palette system that can be saved in the presets and a completely new Waluigi model. Players can also use the older character models originally developed by Nintendo. Some of the biggest additions to the mod are the models and character abilities for Yoshi, Princess Peach, Daisy, and Toadette. Not only is each Nintendo character uniquely animated, but their well-known sound effects have also been added.

  Nintendo did not add co-op capabilities to the original release of
  <em>
   Super Mario 64,
  </em>
  which likely disappointed many fans, considering that some previous installments in the
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  franchise, including
  <em>
   Super Mario World
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. 3,
  </em>
  did. The feature has also been added to a plethora of other Nintendo games that support local and online co-op. Some games allow for four-player online co-op, so giving 16 players the chance to play cooperatively with this
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  mod is wildly chaotic in a potentially fun way. In addition, players can customize the game to their preferences, including changes in vertex and light color, fog color, and fog intensity. Coop Deluxe Team's announcement will surely be exciting for fans monitoring the mod's progress.

  The Extraction Shooter developed by Madfinger Studios,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Gray Zone Warfare
   </strong>
  </em>
  , has a long way to go before its full release. While the developers have been quite active in addressing critical changes brought to their attention by players' feedback, there are a lot of things that could be improved to make the game more attractive for new players.

 <p>
  From all the things that can be said about
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  , is that its UI Design is quite lacking. It is not only confusing, due to the sheer amount of information that appears at the same time, but it also blocks most of the screen when using it.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1022} -->

 <p>
  Opening the inventory takes so much of the screen vision that it is easy to become a sitting duck when trying to make all the loot fit in the backpack. The shop and storage interfaces are merged, but are clunky and could use some remodeling to make them more intuitive for the user. The map takes the whole screen, and though players have a mini-map with a GPS-like feature they can activate, they can only call for choppers by entering the main map interface, and that is basically asking to get shot.

  When inspecting weapons, players will notice that a small window pops up, indicating which attachments and stats that weapon currently has. But the window is too small, and the attachment slots seem to offset and become buggy.

  Working towards a standalone weapon assembly system, similar to the one
  <em>
   Arena Breakout: Infinite
  </em>
  has, could be the way to improve the overall weapon modding experience, and to attract weapon customization enthusiasts as well. Besides, two out of three times, when attaching mods to a weapon, it becomes bugged and players need to reset the game.

 <p>
  Speaking about weapon attachments, the game has a way to let players know which ones are compatible with the weapon currently being inspected. Compatible mods appear highlighted in yellow, but since the interface tends to be clogged with hundreds of parts (be it at the store or those players are hoarding in their storage) it becomes near impossible to distinguish them. There are occasions when the attachment system bugs and logging seems to be the only way to fix it.

  When deploying for the first time in Lamang Island, players will soon learn about Helicopters and how extraction works. The noise of the choppers can be overwhelming though, and these tend to be roaming around the map all the time.

  Choppers can steal players' attention during critical moments and completely block their perception. Losing awareness of their surroundings in the middle of a run can be lethal. There should be an option to at least, diminish the noise those annoying birds make when they pass flying over the player's head.

  There are a lot of complaints about this, and hundreds of reports of enemy AI suddenly turning around to face the player (and even shooting them the second they aim at them) even if they know the player is hiding. Even more so, enemy bullets seem to have little to no falloff and will cause full damage to players even when they're protected by armor.

 <p>
  Perhaps Combat AI needs a tweak or two before giving off that sense of peril the developers wish for the game, without feeling like players are facing off against Ultra Instinct Goku all the time. This problem also discourages new users from keeping up with the game, when dealing with uber-powerful AI enemies from minute 0, the game becomes too frustrating and progression stagnates.

  Another weak point the game has is the lack of tools that extracting players have to defend themselves from campers and roaming enemies attracted by malicious same-faction players. Completing all the missions from faction vendors becomes hard if players are constantly being targeted by campers and losing their precious Quest Items.

 <p>
  Some sandbags covering the extraction zones would be nice, and improved smoke grenades would be even better. But what the game really needs is a way to use camouflage to avoid detection from hostile players. Ghillie Suits would work nicely, but the developers may have concerns about these breaking gameplay balance.

  Despite what many players believe, land vehicles are not all-powerful. They get stuck, they’re noisy, and are exposed to enemy fire. Having one teammate play as the driver can bring a lot of value to the game, and offer an alternative to the chopper-extraction. So, why might the developers be reluctant to implement them in
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  ?

 <p>
  Well, the answer might point towards other FPS like
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  , where roaming vehicles can become a menace for distracted players, and the hit-and-run statistics are spiking. But in
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  , where the grasp of a single bullet can make anyone bleed to death in seconds, there’s no point in fearing a small Humvee or Jeep crossing through the jungle. Players should be more concerned about the Supernatural-sense-empowered AI. On that note: want to avoid vehicle roaming abuse? Limit refueling to the base. That way the driver will not roam around killing players and stick to picking up their friends from wherever they are.

  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  is bound to become a fun-for-all game, but first, it needs to go through a deep revision on how Helicopters and Landing Zones/Extraction Zones work. Most of the Points of Interest in the massive Lamang Island map have from one to three LZs tops.

 <p>
  This is encouraging campers to sit all day long just destroying players, without any true objective other than getting more loot than they can actually carry back to base. Meaningless, and frustrating for players just trying to carry that Task/Quest Item back to their base. So why not add a few Landing Zones In The Map? Or even better, make them rotate randomly among factions, to keep the campers guessing.

 <p>
  If players come to
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  looking for an Extraction Looter Shooter, they should know that loot is tremendously limited right now. Except for weapons, ammo, food, and the occasional cash cache players can find by paying close attention to shops, the rest seems deserted. Sure, there are a few lootable containers here and there, but it doesn't quite feel enough.

 <p>
  This is a big issue for a game that is so heavily focused on deploying, looting, and extracting. Purchasing new gear in late-game is expensive, and the sources of income are mostly bound to completing hundreds of tasks instead of a guaranteed return for the players' hard-earned loot.

  The first time players deploy in
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  , they’ll notice that their tactical belt is the designated slot for a Glock-17 sidearm. Many weapon enthusiasts will say: Oh, boy, here I Go John Wick-ing again! But they’ll soon discover the harsh reality: sidearms are no good at the moment. Even a shot to the face does close to no damage to enemies.

 <p>
  From the seemingly impossible-to-handle Glock-17 to the uncontrollable T-51, sidearms need an overhaul. In any FPS, situations where the primary weapon runs out of ammo mean “time to switch to a sidearm.” But in
  <em>
   Gray Zone Warfare
  </em>
  , players are better off trying their luck bringing their knives to a gunfight. The problem is that enemies seem to be immune to melee damage.

  Just because players get to play as a vampire in
  <em>
   <strong>
    V Rising
   </strong>
  </em>
  does not mean that they are immortal. Even though the player may have a nearly unbeatable character, they will still have to deal with taking damage. For this reason, players must be careful about the damage they take and heal in those vital instances where their chances of survival may be slim.

  While healing is common in video games, many players tend to forgo this feature in
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  . Though the game does inform the player about healing, it does not elaborate on exactly what the process entails. For those unsure of the ins-and-outs of
  <strong>
   healing in
   <em>
    V Rising
   </em>
  </strong>
  , this guide will detail how it works while providing some useful tips on how players can approach doing so.

   <strong>
    Updated on July 4, 2024, by M. Salman Shahid:
   </strong>
   V Rising was fully released on May 8, 2024. As such, it has undergone many changes since its Early Access release on May 17, 2022. This guide aims to reflect those changes by providing more context to the Blood Mend ability, including its side effects, the Blood Pool mechanic, and so on, ensuring that V Rising players will always have access to a healing method.

  Using consumables is the
  <strong>
   best way to heal in
   <em>
    V Rising
   </em>
  </strong>
  during battle. The game offers several consumables for healing; some are available early in the game, while others become available later.

 <ul>
  <li>
   The
   <strong>
    Rat
   </strong>
   is the first consumable available for healing, but it offers limited blood.
  </li>
  <li>
   Consumables like the
   <strong>
    Tainted Heart
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Unsullied Heart
   </strong>
   help with healing, but they do not restore health. They can increase blood, which is handy for Blood Mend.
  </li>
  <li>
   The
   <strong>
    Vermin Salve
   </strong>
   is another healing item that is available early on, and it can be crafted from the crafting menu (Press Tab). The Vermin Salve will restore 2.5% of maximum health every 1.5 seconds for 15 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
   The
   <strong>
    Blood Rose Brew
   </strong>
   can be found in camp loot, and once used, it restores 4% of maximum health per second for 10 seconds.

 <p>
  As mentioned earlier, items like the Unsullied Heart and Untainted Heart increase blood, which is useful for Blood Mend. This ability is the strongest healing ability available in
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  , making it perfect for boss battles. Even though Blood Mend will take longer to heal, it will restore the player to full HP.

  Here are a couple of things to keep in mind about the Blood Mend ability:

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":75} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Upon using the Blood Mend ability, your character will stop and hover in one spot, which means that you will need to think twice about using said ability since it will leave you vulnerable. Additionally, moving while the ability is active will end its effects, so be sure to find a safe area where you do not have to worry about enemies attacking you when you plan to use it.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will drain your Blood Pool when you use the Blood Mend ability. The Blood Pool is the total amount of blood you have in store. When your Blood Pool reaches zero, you will not be able to heal and will start taking damage. To replenish your Blood Pool, you can leech blood from a creature nearby or use an item from your inventory, like a dead rat. You also have the option to ask a friend on the same server to let you suck their character’s blood.
  </li>
  <li>
   Leeching blood from another creature may change your blood type, but consuming items from your inventory will reset it. If you find a useful blood type, make sure the Blood Pool does not reach zero.
  </li>
 </ul>

  players will auto-heal. However, the player will start losing health quickly when they are without blood. Players must move to a safe location and not take damage for the auto-heal to kick in. It is also worth noting that

  <em>
   Anime Heroes Simulator
  </em>
  is an exciting and entertaining adventure RPG that differs from similar
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences due to its unique and diverse mechanics and locations. To find success, you'll need to assemble your team of anime characters to defeat enemies, level up, and visit new worlds.

  Due to the game's extensive campaign, it will take a long time to level up your characters, gather resources, and progress. However, by redeeming
  <em>
   Anime Heroes Simulator
  </em>
  codes, you'll receive generous rewards from the developers, which will give you plenty of valuable resources and save a whole lot of time.

  The Black Knight set is one of the 30 new armor sets introduced in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . Like most other equipment wielded by
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  mobs, procuring it requires farming enemies. In this instance, the targets are the eponymous Black Knights, hard-hitting members of Messmer's army who can usually be found in the vicinity of most soldier encampments players come across in the Land of Shadow.

  Elden Ring: SOTE Player Gets Entire Black Knight Loot Table From a Single Kill

  While the exceedingly low drop rates normally make obtaining the full set a long and arduous affair, Reddit user cammdog1515 recently managed to procure the entirety of it by downing just a single enemy. They immortalized their achievement with a photo of their screen that clearly shows their Tarnished obtaining all four pieces of
  <em>

  The ridiculously lucky drop quickly emerged on the front page of the 2022 Soulsborne's largest subreddit, prompting many
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players to express their astonishment with this achievement. While the exact drop rates of the individual Black Armor set pieces haven't yet been data-mined, anecdotal player testing suggests none of them are higher than a few percentage points. Combined with the fact that this exceedingly fortunate haul even included two Smithing Stones, the drop itself may have an approximately one in a billion chance of happening, at most.

  The extremely unlikely nature of the event even prompted some skepticism among the player base, with several fans saying they suspect cammdog1515 was using cheats to trigger this near-impossible drop. But the player attributed the achievement to pure luck, while also claiming that they're playing through
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  on an Xbox console, which would rule out cheating.

  Although the Black Knight set remains extremely difficult to procure, the main motivation for obtaining it would be to engage in "fashion souls" cosplaying. Namely, as was the case with the base game, the vast majority of the best-in-class armor sets in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  can be found at fixed locations instead of requiring the player to rely on luck.

  Age your character until they are eight years old. This will unlock two new activities: Martial Arts and Walking. Go to the ‘Activities’ section and click on
  <strong>
   ‘Mind &amp; Body’

 <p>
  As your character ages,
  <strong>
   go for regular walks
  </strong>
  (15 minutes to 2 hours) to build stamina. After doing martial arts and walking regularly, it’s time to hit the gym. When your character turns 12, go to the ‘Activities’ section, tap on ‘Mind &amp; Body,’ and choose ‘Gym.’

  There are many sports-related careers in
  <em>
   Bitlife
  </em>
  . Your character can become a top player in Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Lacrosse, Volleyball, Wrestling, or Boxing. And, of course, your character needs
  <strong>
   high athleticism
  </strong>
  for that.

 <p>
  Once you enter secondary school, you'll have the chance to do extracurriculars. This is a
  <strong>
   great way to boost your athleticism stats
  </strong>
  . There are many options available, like Field Hockey, Tennis, Golf, and Gymnastics.

 <p>
  As you get older, you might become the head of your school sports team.
  <em>
   Bitlife
  </em>
  has a special career option called '
  <strong>
   Pro Athlete
  </strong>
  ' for sports lovers. When you turn 18, you can apply to become a professional athlete, but you will need to buy the

   Pro Athlete Job Pack

  for that.

   <strong>
    Dungeons and Dragons
   </strong>
  </em>
  is gearing up for its next inspiring chapter with the 2024
  <em>
   Player’s Handbook

  <em>

  The Rogue class is one of the strongest damage dealers and most effective skill mules. The 2024 version updates Sneak Attack, tweaks its subclasses, and grants Cunning Strike, an enormously powerful feature for combat.

 <p>
  Many Rogue abilities remain largely unchanged, such as Cunning Action and the progression of Sneak Attack. Others, like Blindsense, have been removed. Rogues already cover a broad range of skills across gameplay, so the class didn’t necessarily need to be altered from head to toe. That said, the changes are exciting.

  <em>

  </em>
  roleplaying potential is increased with two small but key features. At level 1, the iconic Thieves’ Cant grants an additional language proficiency to emulate the great number of people Rogues are likely to come across in their networks. Reliable Talent is also moved down from level 11 to level 7, meaning players can roll their easy 32s on lockpicking even faster. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg.

 </h3>
 <p>
  While getting steady advantage on attacks and Sneak Attack makes any Rogue build powerful, the class has a reputation for being a tad boring long-term. The standard for most subclasses is simply to hide, attack, and repeat. The new features clearly aim to make their knavish combat a little more versatile.

 <p>
  In 2024,
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  weapons now come with a unique “mastery property.” At level 1, Rogues get Weapon Mastery, where they can choose two weapons they’re proficient with every long rest and access their mastery properties. For example, here are the properties that come with shortswords and daggers, respectively:
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1063} -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Vex: When you hit a creature, you’ll have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
   </strong>
   This essentially guarantees Sneak Attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Nick: You gain an extra attack on your Attack action if you’re using a weapon with the Light property.
   </strong>
   This could replace the extra attack typically made with a Rogue’s bonus action, freeing it up for Cunning Action and especially handy for Thieves with their Fast Hands feature.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  It’s also become easier for Rogues to trigger Sneak Attack. A feature introduced in
  <em>
   Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything
  </em>
  , Steady Aim allows players to invoke advantage on their next attack roll in that turn with their bonus action, but their speed becomes 0 for the duration. In the 2024
  <em>
   PHB
  </em>
  , it is a standard feature of the class at level 3, reliably granting Sneak Attack.

 <p>
  Level 5 has always been huge for Rogues for their Uncanny Dodge, but now this level also comes with the Cunning Strike, the standout feature of the Rogue update with new ways to damage enemies or move unharmed. The feature states that when a player deals Sneak Attack damage, they can choose to forgo Sneak Attack damage die to add a Cunning Strike effect from the following:

  The DC is based on Dexterity. At level 11, Cunning Strike improves and can add two effects to a single Sneak Attack. But it doesn’t stop there, as at level 14, Rogues get Devious Strike, which expands the Cunning Strike options (though with greater Sneak Attack die costs):

  The level 15 Slippery Mind feature has been upgraded, granting proficiency in both Wisdom and Charisma saves. Finally, this
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  class capstone feature, Stroke of Luck, is largely the same but gets a minor shift. The original feature states that an attack that misses a target within range can be turned into a hit, or, alternatively, a failed ability check can be treated as a 20 on the d20. In the new
  <em>
   PHB
  </em>
  , this feature can now be used on saving throws, and the reroll is always a critical.

  Rogue Subclasses Get Exciting New Traits
 </h3>
 <p>
  The 2024 Rogue subclasses included in the new
  <em>
   PHB
  </em>
  are Arcane Trickster, Soulknife, Assassin, and Thief, the latter two receiving the biggest updates. Tricksters can now swap out a cantrip each time they level up, and when using the Trip Cunning Strike on an enemy, they can target an additional creature within 5 feet of their Mage Hand. For Soulknife, the extended range of their Psychic Blade is now 120 feet, and it has the Vex mastery property as with all shortswords.

 <p>
  Assassins’ core appeal in
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  - that is, assassinating - has been made easier. The primary features are that they can move after using Steady Aim, they can ignore poison resistance with Poison Cunning Strike, and with the new rules on how Surprise works, their Assassinate and Death Strike features now rely on other creatures not taking their turn in initiative yet—with Assassins being granted advantage on initiative rolls.

 <p>
  Thieves are now even trickier than before. Where the Fast Hands feature previously did not apply to magic items, Thieves can now activate them as a bonus action. Use Magic Device similarly grants Thieves an additional attunement slot, the chance to activate items without expending charges, and use of spell scrolls. Additionally, Thieves get access to a unique Cunning Strike called Stealth Attack that allows them to remain hidden after attacking.

 <p>
  For
  <em>
   D&amp;D

  fans of these deceptive sneak masters, the thrilling changes altogether ensure that Rogues can make the most of their turns. When not applying their wide range of

   D&amp;D
  </em>
  skills outside of combat, the typical route for damage dealing is made infinitely more interesting. That is, the changes lean into the beloved dangerous trickster archetype that makes players choose Rogue in the first place.

 <p>
  Despite parent company Ziff Davis’ claims to the contrary, laid off staff of
  <strong>
   Humble Games
  </strong>
  insist that the company has effectively been shut down. Humble Games is the indie publishing arm of Humble Bundle, which most gamers will know for the discounted games it sells to benefit charity. The company began offering publishing services to indie developers in 2017 and was officially branded Humble Games in 2020.

 <p>
  Since its start, Humble Games has helped bring a number of popular indie titles to gamers, including the early access version of
  <em>
   Slay the Spire,
  </em>
  2021’s cozy puzzle game
  <em>
   Unpacking
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Chinatown Detective Agency,
  </em>
  and the award-winning
  <em>
   Signalis.
  </em>
  However, on July 23, posts on social media revealed that the entire 36-person team at Humble Games had been laid off. Parent company Ziff Davis released a statement that the layoffs were merely steps in a restructuring and did not mean the studio was being shut down.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":933} -->

 <p>
  Laid-off staff of Humble Games, speaking to Aftermath, have reiterated that the company has indeed been shut down, no matter how it’s phrased. “No one from HG survived the layoffs, nor will they have anything to do with game launches moving forward,” stated one former employee. In their place, The Powell Group, a third-party company, has been brought in to complete their tasks. Social media posts from other staff echo this sentiment. Chris Radley, who left Humble Games in 2022, wrote about the layoffs on LinkedIn: “Do not believe the tailored message written by the parent company… who are trying to mitigate pushback.”

  Humble Games Parent Company Says It's Just Restructuring
 </h2>
 <p>
  During the layoff meeting with staff, which somebody recorded, Ziff Davis President of Tech &amp; Shopping Steve Horowitz explained that the restructuring at Humble Games was due to rising costs and release delays. Attempts to sell the company have been unsuccessful. To remain cost effective, Ziff Davis is turning to a third-party to manage past and future Humble Games releases and provide developer support.

 <p>
  However, given that the entire staff has been laid off and the company’s projects are now being handled by The Powell Group, only the name Humble Games remains. Former employees deny the claim that this is only a restructuring, with some calling the PR speak an attempt to save face and gaslight. Others have called into question the parent company’s understanding of video game publishing, and the reasonable expectations and timelines that go with it, in general.

  Ziff Davis is a well-established company that made its name publishing print magazines like
  <em>
   Popular Aviation, Amazing Stories,

  and
  <em>
   Electronics World.

  Eventually, it branched into television for a few years and, relatively more recently, began acquiring hobbyist websites. It now owns a gamut of properties, including numerous video game focused sites like Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN, Eurogamer, and HowLongToBeat.com.

  Players who wish to get their hands on this
  <strong>
   Ultimate Module
  </strong>
  will want to head to the
  <strong>
   Kingston
  </strong>
  location. This is the first area of the game and is divided into various sections. Players will want to go to
  <strong>
   Slumber Valley
  </strong>
  dungeon, which can be found in the
  <strong>
   Grand Square
  </strong>
  section of the map. However, it is advised that players not try to get this
  <strong>
   Module
  </strong>
  while the game is set to
  <strong>
   Normal
  </strong>
  . Instead, players should complete every kind of mission on the map so that they can attempt missions on
  <strong>
   Hard
  </strong>
  . Playing this dungeon on Hard will raise the chance of getting this Module to 5%.

  Players can also increase their Module acquisition chance by equipping the right gear. Players should check their rare gear, which is purple if any of them raise the chances of them getting modules while they are wearing it. Plates should have unlocked Bunny through a Sub Quest before being able to play this dungeon on hard, and switching to her is highly recommended with how fast she can move and dispatch groups of enemies.

  Out of all the modules in the game, only some will be limited to specific
  <strong>
   Descendants
  </strong>
  . You will find plenty of them that can modify any of the characters you already have. This Module will modify the player’s
  <strong>
   grappling hook
  </strong>
  , and now allow it to reach a distance of 25 meters. This does come with a cost though. The
  <strong>
   Base Charge Time
  </strong>
  for the grappling hook will now be 6 seconds. This charge time is also increased by 20% based on the
  <strong>
   Enhancement Level.
  </strong>
  Enhancing this Module will increase its Max Module Capacity, but will decrease the Charge Time Increase for each enhancement.

  Players will be able to upgrade their Modules back at
  <strong>
   Albion

  by going to speak with

  <strong>
   Max Capacity
  </strong>
  through the use of
  <strong>
   Energy Activators
  </strong>
  . This will give players a significant increase in their maneuverability and traversal options — both while moving to the next mission marker, and while fighting against

   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  is responsible for some of the most iconic JRPGs in gaming history, with one of their biggest grand slams being
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  can get a little wild, there are titles in the franchise that dive into the completely absurd.

 <p>
  Games can get confusing and hard to follow, and this can be because of just how off the rails the story can lead players.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 2
  </em>
  is a great example of how constantly throwing twist after twist can send the story into an utterly bizarre spiral.

 <p>
  The story starts with a standard high fantasy style storyline and one of the shortest ones out of any
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game. A powerful evil emperor poses a threat to the neighboring kingdom and sends forth all manner of hellish forces across the land. While absurdity is pretty common among modern RPGs,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  was one of the first to shove as many ideas as possible into a single story. Technology ranges from magical items and mechanical airships to the sci-fi style Dreadnought of the Dark Knight.

 <p>
  The King of the neighboring kingdom falls deathly ill and the player party sets off to find the last Dragoon, only to end up being attacked by pirates — who join them. The last Dragoon entrusts the players with its egg to take to a magic spring. The game also implements many uses of the “switcharoo” such as when an ally turns out to be an enemy shapeshifter. This is just a small taste of the absurdity that ensues.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy Versus 13
  </em>
  went through a roller coaster of development, making its final form,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 15
   </em>
  </strong>
  , one of the most impressive reveals in the franchise.
  <em>
   Final
  </em>
  <em>
   Fantasy 15
  </em>
  is set in the world of Eos and does an amazing job of capturing a modernized world setting, in a world where magic exists. The way players drive a stylish car down paved roads, set up campsites, and stop to take pictures with a camera, creates the experience of a group of friends going on a road trip. The game’s story itself has been said to be extremely confusing, and this is because not all of the lore is within just the game.

  The story is spread across numerous media, including a series, a film, and a novel. Players that explore these other mediums will have a greater understanding of many of the elements in the game to have the full story come together. Hunting down all the lore elements for Ardyn, the Demons, and both timelines the game is set in can be a little too much for some players to digest.

  In the world of Gran Pulse is the isolated floating city of Cocoon. Anyone in Cacoon who interacts with the outside world will be banished. These laws are enforced by the fal’Cie of Cocoon, beings treated by the inhabitants of Cocoon as gods, despite having been created by an even more powerful being. The story’s main protagonist, Lightning, wishes to save her crystallized Cocoon l’Cie sister by finding a fal’Cie from Gran Pulse. The l’Cie are humans that have been chosen by the fal’Cie to fulfill a special purpose known as their Focus. Those who fulfill their focus are crystallized as a reward, as this grants them “eternal life.”

  Upon confronting the fal’Cie, the protagonist and party are turned into l’Cie. It is revealed that two of the party members are former Pulse l’Cie who awoke from their crystalized state thirteen days before the events of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 13
  </em>
  ’s start. The party discovers their Focus is to destroy Cocoon, as this will summon the being that created the fal’Cie. The party members are able to slay the sleeping fal’Cie which holds up Cocoon, causing Cocoon to fall, fulfilling their Focus and turning into crystals. However, two of the party members transform into a powerful entity known as Ragnarok, and then into a pillar that holds up Cocoon, preventing its destruction. This causes the other party members to all awaken from their crystal states, including Lightning’s sister. This is one of several
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games to spawn several sequels, which are easier to follow.

  Of all the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games released on the PS2 console,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first. The narrative has players following the story of Tidus, who is a resident of the city of Zanarkand. After a giant monster named Sin attacks, he supposedly wakes up in the far future, where Zanarkand is a ruined city. Players will learn more about the world of Spira and beings called the Fayth.

 <p>
  Turns out, Tidus is not from the past, but instead a dream of the Fayth. Both he and the Zanarkand that he is from were both dreams the whole time. The Fayth were people that willingly let their spirits be infused into stone tablets, but still dream in this state. These dreams can be used to call Summons into the world of Spira. There are a lot of fans who are still eagerly waiting to see if this is one of the next
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games to hopefully get a remake.

 <p>
  There are many versions of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  , but the story stays just as bizarre. Players will easily notice that the game is set in a world that has two moons. What they will not be aware of is that one of these moons is a fake created by an advanced alien race. The story follows the game’s protagonist and his close friend, who are following the orders of the king, but turn on the king after realizing how much destruction they have left in their wake under his orders. However, this realization comes just before an earth-splitting cataclysmic event that releases a mighty titan and separates the protagonist from his friend.

  This sets the player on a path of a globetrotting journey filled with characters who are not who they claim to be, including a voice inside the protagonist's head that claims to be his father. The protagonist also reunites with his friend who is now brainwashed and serves as a major antagonist. This is all to create a pathway to the Red Moon, but is thwarted. However, the protagonist is able to acquire an airship capable of sailing to the Red Moon where an alien being resides. It is here the player learns that the protagonist is half-alien and that he has a brother. After defeating the final threat, the alien is able to go back into hibernation as the Red Moon drifts off and out of the planet’s orbit.

  <strong>
   Nvidia
  </strong>
  has commemorated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256 with a lengthy write-up reflecting on the graphics card's transformative role in the company's history, as well as numerous industries. The move also saw Nvidia tease some of its future AI plans, all of which can be traced back to the seminal GPU.

 <p>
  The GeForce 256 was first revealed on August 31, 1999, before hitting the market on October 11. It was touted as "the world's first GPU," promising to offer accelerated graphics-based processing that would solve a wide variety of computational problems. Nvidia saw video games as the killer app for marketing its new product family at the time, not least because gaming was both computationally challenging and looked like it was developing into a humongous industry.

  Nvidia GeForce 256 Turns 25

 <p>
  A quarter of a century later, Nvidia has become the world's second-most valuable company, boasting a market cap of $3.3 trillion as of October 2024, which puts it above technology giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Its meteoric rise can largely be traced back to the GeForce 256, which marked the first visible result of the company's long-term bet on dedicated graphics processing units. Nvidia Director of Marketing John Fenno said as much in a recent blog post celebrating the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, noting how Nvidia GPUs were eventually found to be capable of handling the "immense processing needs" of deep learning computing that previously required supercomputers, which happened circa 2011.

  This discovery, combined with the mass-market nature of the company's hardware, ushered in an era of rapid AI advancements. The growing need for Nvidia GPUs among data scientists and AI researchers informed the company's engineering priorities, as underlined by the fact that its modern graphics cards are specifically designed to handle a wide variety of deep learning tasks. This shift started in 2018, when Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX 20 Series, its first lineup of GPUs with dedicated Tensor and RT Cores geared toward handling AI and real-time ray tracing workloads, respectively.

  <strong>
   Billy the Puppet is located at Freaky Fields
  </strong>
  , where Reckless Railways used to be. More specifically, Billy the Puppet is
  <strong>
   inside the large white house
  </strong>
  on the homestead. Inside the white house, players will see a TV in the center of the ground floor.
  <strong>
   Approach the TV
  </strong>
  , and an image of Billy the Puppet will appear. Players must then hold the interact button (Square/X/E on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) on the TV screen. After which, Billy the Puppet will burst from the screen and begin an unrelenting boss fight.

  Now that players have summoned Billy from Freaky Fields, he will charge at players with his pickaxe. Billy is much taller than normal NPCs, and his unrelenting charge will have him constantly swing his pickaxe, which if it hits the player, deals 12 damage per hit. Billy himself has around 500 to 600 Health, so make sure to lay into him with a barrage of bullets, as a fair pickaxe fight against this behemoth will only end poorly for the player.

  In a recent update, the developers of
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Planet Crafter
   </strong>
  </em>
  added a real vehicle to the game. While you could get around well enough using agility boots and a jetpack, the new rover has a few features you don't get from this regular equipment.

 <p>
  Of course, the rover also has a few drawbacks that come from driving a large vehicle on a map without roads or many flat surfaces. Still, the developers have accounted for these issues, and they added some tricks that make it easier to move the rover across the map. However, the first thing you need to know is how to unlock the rover in

  You can build a rover once you unlock the Vehicle Station structure in
  <em>
   The Planet Crafter
  </em>
  , which has a requirement of 6.5 MTi. This means it appears in the early-mid phase of the game, after you unlock the rocket pad but before the ice starts melting into lakes. To craft the station, you'll need:

  You can then build the station anywhere outside your base. Keep in mind that one side of the Vehicle Station is a ramp, and this ramp should face in the direction you want the rover to point.

  One side of the Vehicle Station has a console with two monitors. The central monitor lets you craft rovers and rover upgrades, with the rover itself needing:

 <p>
  The right monitor lets you respawn any rover on the map. You can't name your rovers, and so the respawn monitor lists rovers based on their coordinates. You can find your current coordinates at any time by checking the numbers in the lower-left corner of your screen.

 <p>
  Once used, the "Return to Garage" function needs 600 seconds (10 minutes) before you can use it again. However, this cooldown period applies separately to each Vehicle Station. This means you can build stations around the map to get your rover around obstacles it would otherwise have trouble with. It also means you can build Vehicle Stations and Teleporters together to get both you and your rover across the map in an instant.

  Along with the rover itself, you can use the Vehicle Station to craft several rover upgrades. These provide benefits like extra speed, bigger cargo, and better headlights. However, not all of them are available immediately. To get any of the advanced vehicle upgrades, you'll need to find and decode random blueprint microchips, while two others demand terraformation milestones.

  The rover is a complex machine, and clicking on it does different things depending on what you're looking at.

 <ul>
  <li>
   If you interact with the main cabin in front, you'll get into the driver's seat and can start driving the rover around the map.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you click on the black box on the left side of the rover, you'll open the equipment slots. This is where you can add all your vehicle upgrades.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you click on the blue chest at the back end, you'll open up the rover's inventory. This is also where you can add or remove supply and demand orders when you have the Logistics upgrade installed.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you click on one of the two seats in the back, you'll sit down and become a rover passenger. This is a useful way for players to stick together during a multiplayer game, but these seats have no purpose in a single-player session. Also, passengers don't get free oxygen even if you have the right upgrade installed.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you have a beacon installed, you can find a display on the right side of the rover. This lets you change the beacon's color. However, you can't remove or change the rover outline in the beacon marker.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the back of the rover is a big red button that says "Grab."
   <strong>
    If the rover's inventory is empty
   </strong>
   , clicking on this button will add the rover to your personal inventory. You can then deploy the rover by right-clicking on its icon.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li>
   The rover has trouble climbing over rocks and getting around trees, but water doesn't even slow it down.
  </li>
  <li>
   The Unlimited Oxygen upgrade has a use even after you reach the Breathable Atmosphere milestone. Swimming underwater still costs oxygen, but you can drive underwater without problems if you have this upgrade.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you manage to flip the rover, and you're carrying too much to use the Grab button, you can press F4 from the driver's seat to reset the rover's location. This places it slightly above and behind your current location, with the wheels pointed down.
  </li>
  <li>
   Another way to retrieve your rover is to head to the nearest Vehicle Station and use the Return to Garage function (see above). Unlike the Grab button, this works even if your rover's inventory is full.
  </li>
  <li>
   A fully upgraded rover and a fully upgraded jetpack are about the same speed. The real advantage of the upgraded rover is that it's a mobile outpost.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you unlock the Logistics upgrade, set your rover's inventory to "Supply All" as soon as you can. With the right base setup, your drones will empty your rover's inventory almost as fast as you can fill it.
  </li>

 <p>
  A novelty in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is the combat system. In addition to the traditional turn-based battles, it introduces
  <strong>
   action moments,
  </strong>
  a mechanic that should be utilized frequently. If attacks are executed well, there are no downsides and several positives.
 </p>

 <p>
  For instance, even if enemies aren't defeated by these attacks, players can initiate the turn-based combat phase with an advantage, causing initial damage and leaving foes paralyzed. Adopting an offensive stance in

  </em>
  is a tip many players should follow.

  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio

  encourages character customization, allowing players to change the class not only of the protagonist, but also of all party members. This is done through
  <strong>
   Archetypes
  </strong>
  , which loosely resemble the Personas from Atlus's titular franchise.

  Even if an Archetype seems to fit a character's concept, players shouldn't restrict themselves to it. Many options emerge throughout the game, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. A great beginner's tip for
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is to adapt to the challenges the game presents and not limit oneself to a few options.

  JRPGs generally require good support in the team to enable other characters to deal damage, and that's the role of the Healer Archetype in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . Players can equip it on the protagonist, who likely has the highest magic values at the game's start, or assign it to another character.

  Therefore, players should always keep an eye out for chests or merchants, investing substantial gold in these items when possible. By utilizing the full potential of Archetypes, it's easy to run out of mana, which can make some encounters tougher or force an early retreat from a dungeon. Make sure to have a way to keep it topped up.

  A tip the game doesn't delve into deeply, but that beginners in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  should explore, is the formation mechanic during turn-based battles. It
  <strong>
   allows characters to advance or retreat during combat

  , affecting how certain skills interact with them.

 <p>
  A frontline character will deal more damage to enemies, but is also more susceptible to powerful enemy attacks. Conversely, retreating a character can be a good option to protect them, albeit at the cost of offensive potential. Recognizing the right moments to make these decisions is crucial, especially against bosses.

  While the game encourages frequent switching between Archetypes, it's also possible for skills from one to be learned by another class, allowing greater customization among characters. Doing so is essential, as well-executed builds can devastate enemies with ease.

 <p>
  For example, the Warrior Archetype has access to a passive skill called Heat Up, which grants a 10% increase in physical attack damage. Combining it with other offensive classes is an interesting possibility. To achieve this, players need to
  <strong>
   speak with More at the Akademia
  </strong>
  and have sufficient MAG to learn these new abilities.

  In the gameplay loop of
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , players will find themselves exploring dungeons and interacting with their party members most of the time. However, they should also make room to complete requests. These small side missions are simple but can also be useful.

 <p>
  Spread throughout all the maps, the objectives are almost like fetch quests. Players must go to a certain place to retrieve an item and deliver it to the requester. Many of these missions don't consume a day's time slot and are along the paths players would normally take. So, in addition to helping an NPC, the rewards can also be beneficial.

  At some point, most JRPGs require grinding to obtain the best items or other in-game resources. This can also happen in this Atlus title, especially concerning Archetypes. A beginner's tip for
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is to always use Hero's Incenses or Hero's Fruits.

 <p>
  These items grant
  <strong>
   additional experience to an Archetype of choice
  </strong>
  , increasing progress toward unlocking new skills. Progress can also be made through battles, but sometimes, particularly when some classes lag behind others, using incenses or fruits is essential to balance the characters.

  Veterans of Atlus games are already familiar with this mechanic, but it's a golden tip for newcomers to
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . One of the best ways to succeed in the game's battles is by exploiting each enemy's elemental weaknesses.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It's important to always experiment with new attacks to discover which elements or damage types they are strong or weak against. By exploiting these weaknesses, players can earn extra turns in combat. However, it's worth noting that the same applies to enemies, who can also exploit the main characters' weaknesses, especially at higher difficulties.

   OD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  in the works, Kojima Productions has its hands full. However,
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  could prove to be an exciting return to form for Kojima.

 <p>
  There isn't much known about what
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  will entail, but Kojima is promising something deeply cinematic with a focus on stealth and espionage. When the game was first announced, Kojima admitted that one of the main motivating factors for
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  was the constant requests from fans for another
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  game. Although he is no longer involved with
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  , Kojima was inspired to revisit this type of gameplay, which makes
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  an exciting prospect.

  Kojima Embracing His Metal Gear Franchise Through a New IP
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's been made clear that Kojima Productions is focused on boldly testing boundaries with its games.
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  is a title that doesn't exactly sound like it would work on paper, but the final product resonated with a lot of players, whether they were longtime Kojima fans or not. Kojima's upcoming horror title,
  <em>
   OD
  </em>
  , also appears to be something completely strange and innovative, but
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  sounds like a trip down memory lane, at least partially.

  The
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  franchise really stood out among a variety of games in the genre at the time, thanks to its focus on espionage and stealth over action-packed moments.
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  's slower approach to telling a spy story really added an extra level of tension that other games lacked, and this offered a great challenge to players. Not only that, but the spy-fueled stories at the heart of each chapter were a compelling draw as well. Now that Kojima is giving the genre another go, it could be exciting to see him return to the approach that helped make him such a heavy-hitter in the industry.

  <em>
   Physint

  acting as
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  's spiritual successor is good news for many Kojima fans, but what's even more intriguing is that the game will potentially set itself apart as a unique IP as well. Kojima has been subverting genre expectations, and it would be surprising if he didn't apply some sort of gameplay or story twist that flips the espionage genre on its head. A
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  -inspired project with Kojima's newfound free reign could be a recipe for something truly special.

  Cinematic and Innovative Projects Define the Developer
 </h3>
 <p>
  Exploring and enacting fresh and strange concepts has quickly become the bread and butter of Kojima Productions.
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  may be its only released title right now, but it has set a clear tone of what is to be expected from the developer in the future. Following Kojima's recent
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  update, the anticipation for an update on
  <em>
   OD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  is mounting.
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  will inevitably be compared to the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  series, but a game that balances plenty of the latter's best qualities with something fresh and experimental could be a match made in heaven.

  There's no telling when new information about
  <em>
   Physint
  </em>
  will see the light of day, but when that time comes, it will be fascinating to see how similar or different it is to

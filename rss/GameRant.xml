   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  has a huge map with several locations that are locked off, requiring players to either find a code or a key to access them. As these inaccessible locations usually have some great loot locked behind them, it's worth checking them out. One of these locations is called the Agricultural Workshop in the Yantar region, with a locked stairwell that leads to some valuable loot. Here's how players can unlock access to upper floors and secure the loot.

  Players can find the Agricultural Workshop in the Yantar region
  <strong>
   southwest of the Rostok Base
  </strong>
  in
  <em>

  . After entering the POI, you'll notice that one of the stairwells in the building is locked. You'll be able to find the key inside the compound, but it'll take a bit of exploration. However, it's worth reaching the top of this building as you'll be getting a powerful armor piece to equip and lots of valuable loot.

 <ol>
  <li>
   Enter the Agricultural Workshop POI, take an immediate left, and enter the building.
  </li>
  <li>
   Keep heading further into the building until you come across an open stairwell. Reach the top and go through the room until you arrive at the catwalk with Electro anomaly.

  <li>
   Carefully follow along the catwalk and make sure to pick up some loot along the way. Once you reach the end, you can pick up the first key beside a body.

  A prominent

  </strong>
  leaker has claimed that The Hood will be coming to the popular hero shooter as a Vanguard.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is currently in the opening weeks of Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, which features Dracula as the title's main antagonist. While Season 0 took place over the course of several weeks, the developers have stated that a typical full-length season will last for three months.

  ' Vanguards act as tanks, utilizing large health pools and damage mitigating abilities to protect themselves and allies. These heroes can often be found leading the charge when capturing a point or guiding a convoy. While some Vanguards, like Doctor Strange, put up a shield to block incoming attacks, others use bonus health and regeneration to soak up damage as they dive on enemies. These characters typically rely on healing from Strategists in order to play their role effectively and benefit from the synergy that comes with a good team composition. It is expected that The Thing will be

  ' next Vanguard when he is added in a mid-season update alongside Human Torch.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent post on Twitter, Rivals_Leaks claimed that The Hood will be coming to the hero shooter as a Vanguard. Many fans seemed surprised by the news, as they expected the pistol-wielding villain to be another Duelist in the game's roster. While the character began as a petty criminal, he gained superpowers after defeating a demon and stealing its cloak and boots. With abilities that include levitation and invisibility, he quickly rose to prominence in the underworld of New York City. There's no telling when The Hood may come to the title, but NetEase Games has stated that players can expect to see a new
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  hero added every six weeks.

 <p>
  The co-op action roguelike
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  is scheduled for a
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  release on February 6, 2025, and it’s a vibrant spectacle from developer Windwalk Games and publisher Team17. The basic premise of the anticipated Steam title highlights that up to four players can take part in the co-op action, exploring a fallen Camelot to reclaim the kingdom from the corruption of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final playtest for
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  went live on January 16, where players could test Ultimate abilities and play through two biomes. It was then announced that
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  would be open for Early Access at the beginning of February, and for gamers interested in the concept, the live demo offers challenges to complete and several weapons and abilities to master. Despite the wait for
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  being nearly over, there’s a healthy collection of Arthurian movies and TV shows to bide medieval fanatics’ time in the interim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Announced on the game’s Steam page and social media,
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  ’s creative team acknowledged the months of playtests indulged by the community and confirmed
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  was ready to advance with Early Access. With Camelot’s gates close to opening, players can look forward to fusing their characters' strengths while mastering abilities to overthrow Arthur’s reign, and the game’s marketing touched on the appeal of multiple runs.
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  will join a host of medieval games due to release in 2025 and beyond, including
  <em>
   Crimson Desert
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Blight: Survival,
  </em>
  and Windwalk Games’ impressive comic world promises to join the best.

 <p>
  <em>
   SWORN
  </em>
  also boasts changing battlefields where players’ creativity can peak, with gameplay resembling some of the most complex roguelike games in the ranks. While it’s advertised as a co-op game, solo play is also on offer, where gamers can undertake the role of a Soulforged knight, befriend iconic characters like Merlin and Nimue, and get to the bottom of a darkness spreading over Avalon. Additionally, players can brush up on their Fae lore after swearing loyalty to the Fae Lords, harboring over 200 unique blessings.

  Another medieval title releasing in February is Warhorse Studios’
  <em>

  </em>
  , and it’s an anticipated continuation of Henry’s story. Despite the recent backlash targeting the inclusion of LGBTQ content in the sequel,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  recently issued an exciting update for fans. Review codes were deployed four weeks ahead of the game’s launch on February 4, 2025, which has also given the developer ample time to iron out any bugs before the game’s full debut.

      <title>8 Best Transformation Horror Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-transformation-horror-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Transformation is a fun concept to play around with. In some media, it’s a bright, hope-inspiring, heroic thing, where the protagonist has become something different and more powerful than their foes can imagine. It’s Goku turning Super Saiyan, Sonic becoming Super Sonic, or a Pokémon evolving into a stronger, more versatile form.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Yet not all transformations are the same. One could become weaker and frailer, or bloodier and more gruesome. Instead of being an exhilarating, liberating process, it can be painful and upsetting, turning the figure into an indescribable abomination. Many games have played around with the horror of transformation, with these games being some of the best examples.

  There are plenty of big-name games for players to draw on for transformation and body horror. But if they go off the beaten path, they can find some particularly gruesome gems, like the works of Yames. He made his name creating creepy computer games with grisly transformative themes, like
  <em>
   Growing My Grandpa
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Father Turned Me into Trees and Rivers
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Discover My Body
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of his more straightforward games. It follows a medical student who, in the hopes of uniting humanity via science, infects himself with a strain of fungus. The players have to scan and examine themselves as the fungus spreads and learn how it affects the human body. It produces happiness and a sense of unity, but at a high price.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Water Womb World
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues that, as its Catholic researcher looks for proof of the Garden of Eden, believing it to exist on the ocean floor. To do that, players have to catch fish and sift through the seabed to find objects to study.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though what he finds is anything but divine, as each discovery is more abominable than the last. Yet the researcher finds each one fascinating, growing blind to his own gradual transformation as he becomes as gruesome as his fishy friends. It won't take players long either as, like
  <em>
   Discover My Body
  </em>
  , it's a fairly short game that doesn't take long to get grisly.

  As Yames' games suggest, the brain is just as vulnerable to being distorted in one way or another as the rest of the body. Once it's under control by an otherworldly being or biological horror, the rest of the figure will follow. It turns up in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
   </strong>
  </em>
  too, as lead character Ethan finds his long-lost wife Mia, who can turn from her usual self to being as violent and psychotic as the Baker Family on a dime.
 </p>
 <p>
  They seemingly can't be killed, as they come back from lethal wounds multiple times. As Ethan presses on, he discovers their inhuman endurance and psychotic fits are the result of a mold infection, where they're being controlled by another figure hiding in the background. If Ethan can't figure out a way to overcome the mold, he could lose Mia for good.

  Aside from being grisly, one of the big fear factors behind body horror is that there’s no escape from it. People can’t run away from their own bodies being distorted one way or the other. Like in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Parasite Eve
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where the titular Eve can manipulate anyone at the cellular level. She could make whole crowds burst into flames, or melt them into a giant, orange pile of slime.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result of a genetic experiment gone wrong, Eve aims to wipe out humanity to replace them with her child, the “Ultimate Being”. The only hope of beating her lies in one rookie cop, Aya Brea, who has more in common with Eve than she thinks. Players could find out how they're linked through the game, or by reading the original
  <em>
   Parasite Eve
  </em>
  novel, which goes further into Eve's creation and mitochondrial manipulations.

  As grim as
  <em>

  gets, the
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  games have offered grimmer transformations.
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  , though diluted by its action movie yucks, churns the stomach with its eerie credits sequence depicting the Ganados' transformation. The
  <em>
   RE1
  </em>
  remake improved the classic game by adding some transformation horror via the Crimson Heads and Lisa Trevor, a young girl turned into a malformed monster by Umbrella. But the first game in the series to really dive into transformation horror was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  One of its main villains, William Birkin, is gradually mutated by the G-Virus until whatever was recognizable about him gets subsumed by the mass of flesh, claws, and eyes. Eventually, he doesn't even look like any natural lifeform on earth. Yet it's suggested he still has some form of his old senses, as he still recognizes his daughter Sherry. Which isn't a good thing, as Claire and Leon have to keep her safe from whatever Birkin's become.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Bloodborne
   </em>
  </strong>
  is practically all about the horrors of transformation. The School of Mensis sought to transcend humanity by taking a substance called the Old Blood, and the Healing Church shared it among the citizens of Yharnam to cure all ailments. It kind of worked in that, over time, it cures people and turns them into the monstrous beasts the player’s Hunter has to fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game goes into the lore behind the Old Blood, and the eldritch Great Ones they’re connected to. Though it also goes into the horror of its transformations, showing how the likes of Vicar Amelia are doomed to turn into lethal monstrosities because of the Old Blood and their faith. Depending on what choices the player makes, the Hunter can achieve the School's goal and become something inhuman themselves.

  It’s hard to imagine many works of transformation and body horror being a thing without movies like
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  , nor
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  being a thing without the work of H.R Giger. The late Swiss artist became the go-to figure for body horror and sickly transformations. Developers Ebb Software took note of his work and combined it with the work of another macabre artist to create
  <strong>
   <em>
    Scorn
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a first-person survival horror game where its leads are trapped in some unearthly realm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its techno-organic abominations, flesh-repurposing Assembly, and fates of its silent protagonists are reminiscent of Giger. Though its broken figures, misty monochrome world, and oppressive structures resemble works by Zdzisław Beksiński, who was no stranger to body horror himself. They add an extra layer of unease, sucking out whatever hope players might've found before they discover how grim
  <em>
   Scorn
  </em>
  gets.

  Creepy religious cults aren’t just for gothic horror. EA Redwood Shores managed to find room for one in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Space
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where adherents of ‘Unitology’ worship artifacts called ‘Markers’, believing they’ll usher in a new world via the “Convergence” (i.e. the end of humanity). Though they’re more than just MacGuffins, as they're also responsible for creating the Necromorphs.
 </p>
 <p>
  They're undead creatures driven by a hive mind to kill off all forms of life in their vicinity. While formed from dead bodies and disembodied bodyparts, they can mutate in different, horrific ways to attack their prey. Some produce extra limbs to slice people apart, others grab them with stretching tendrils, or chuck their own disembodied heads at them, which will then rip the victim's own head off, and hijack their decapitated bodies.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  is of the greatest games in the series, and players can't get enough of it to this day. The shift to a futuristic fantasy setting was a breath of fresh air for a series that had pushed its medieval fantasy roots to their limit. The dark and gritty aesthetic of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  helped its story stand out even more, and the monster designs felt more impactful as a result.

 <p>
  The linework is astounding, giving each sprite a foreboding presence that stretches to the easier enemies as well. Players can gauge the threat of each enemy based on their design. They will either feel a sense of relief at encountering an easy enemy, or find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place when a particularly tough enemy comes their way. The monsters of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  are arguably the best that the 2D era of this genre could afford players. It was the perfect time for these monster designs to peak before the franchise shifted to 3D.

  It speaks to the pride that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12
  </em>
  takes in its monster designs that a major part of the gameplay loop is engaging in monster hunts. These let players encounter a wide variety of enemies who are designed immaculately. The monster variety in
  <em>

  </em>
  is impressive to this day. The designs help convey their dangerous nature and how players must customize their Gambits to employ effective strategies against their enemies.

  To this day, gamers can't stop singing the praises of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  . The franchise's PS2 debut was a resounding success that implemented a unique isekai story with memorable characters and a new take on the turn-based combat system everyone knows and loves. Of course, the biggest reason why players love this game is the monster designs, which offer classic
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  creatures with a fresh coat of paint.

  Every monster in the series oozes personality and is memorable from the moment players encounter these foes. It's easy to progress through the Sphere Grid and make quick work of these enemies, but the game has the ability to throw a curveball and force players into a tough-as-nails encounter against a difficult monster that looks the part. Square's pride in these designs can be seen with the inclusion of a Monster Arena that lets players encounter numerous tough foes.

  The graphical upgrade of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  over its predecessor blew the minds of many fans back in the day. Animations were enhanced extensively, with enemies displaying unique idle states, as well as conveying the damage they're suffering. The game also featured a death animation for the first time in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series. All of this leads to a combat system that is bursting with personality.

 <p>
  The gameplay mechanics of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  may be a bit too experimental for their own good, but the monster designs ensure that combat never ceases to be engaging. The fact that a simple Tyrannosaurus rex looks like one of the most threatening enemies in the game is a testament to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  's amazing monster design and how it made up for most of the game's problems.

 <p>
  There's no denying that the developmental problems of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  hampered the quality of the end product. Players had to see an anime and a movie to get the full gist of the title's epic narrative. This, coupled with a combat system that is often too easy, should have led to the game being derided by the masses. However, it only takes a few hours to see that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  is a labor of love that has a lot of things going for it. Listing all of them may be a bit too much, but one thing that this game must be lauded for is its variety of enemies.

 <p>
  The sheer number of enemy types that players can encounter in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  is astounding. Every corner of the world hides a unique enemy that's a joy to engage in battle with. Each enemy is painstakingly designed to convey its threat with a unique moveset, ensuring that players get to witness the most awe-inspiring versions of their favorite
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  enemies. Even if the vast majority of these enemies are relatively easy to take out, that doesn't take anything away from these amazing monster designs. Players are compelled to fill up the entire bestiary and check out the painstaking work put into every detailed 3D model.

  A skilled group of
  <strong>
   <em>
    WWE 2K24
   </em>
  </strong>
  content creators recently recreated some of Triple H’s most famous outfits from 2006 in a custom playable character.
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  already comes packed with plenty of fun content for wrestling fans, from the 2K Showcase mode featuring some of the greatest matches from the past 40 years of WrestleMania, two MyRise campaigns that allow players to rise to the top of the promotion as a created wrestler, and new
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  stipulations like Special Guest Referee and Casket matches.

 <p>
  Like with most wrestling games, part of the fun of
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  lies with its in-depth content creation options, which let fans create their own in-ring performers, factions, titles, arenas, and more - as well as share them online with other players. Some of
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  ’s content creators have recreated famous Marvel superheroes like Deadpool and Wolverine, celebrities like pop star Chappell Roan, and (naturally) past wrestlers who currently aren’t available to play, like ECW legend Sabu.

 <p>
  <em>

  </em>
  fan creations can also be based on past versions of wrestlers who already are in the game, with TheJumpMan98 recently posting their alternate rendition of former WWE Champion-turned-Chief Content Officer Triple H on r/WWEGames. This custom character model was made in collaboration with another creator by the handle of ApplesAndOranges, and is based on Triple H's appearance as an active wrestler in 2006. Included in the package are custom crowd signs and commentary along with four period-accurate attires, including Triple H’s medieval entrance gear from WrestleMania 22 and the DX outfit he wore during his reunion with longtime partner Shawn Michaels.

  This custom version of Triple H also does a great job of capturing the King of King’s 2006 appearance, from his physique to his long hair and handlebar mustache.
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  already includes some of Triple H’s most notable looks, but it is worth pointing out that the 40 Years of WrestleMania left out his unsuccessful WWE Championship match against
  <em>
   WWE 2K23
  </em>
  cover star John Cena from WrestleMania 22, hence the lack of his attire from that event.

 <p>
  While omissions like this might be disappointing to longtime wrestling fans, talented
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  content creators like TheJumpMan98 and ApplesAndOranges have done their best to add past wrestlers and outfits as downloadable custom characters that can be used in exhibition matches and MyUniverse mode. This in turn adds to

      <title>The Best Games On Xbox Game Pass (August 2024)</title>

  Microsoft’s Game Pass service is easily worth the price of admission. Many might balk at the concept of having their video game library locked behind a subscription service, but the fact is subscribers get access to an incredible selection of titles spanning from indie darlings to triple-A blockbusters for a surprisingly affordable monthly fee.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":354} -->

 <p>
  With such a dizzying array of fantastic titles on display, it can be a daunting task deciding which ones are worth a player’s time. Given that the cost of entry is taken care of with the subscription fee, the most pressing matter is determining the best use of your hard drive space. Thankfully, the diamonds of this collection are readily apparent. Here’s a look at the greatest games that Xbox Game Pass has to offer.

  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  is a masterpiece of cinema. It captured the nuance and customs of one Italian-American crime family, and sparked an interest in the mafioso lifestyle it portrayed. I wouldn’t have thought it possible for a video game to capture that same mesmerizing dynamic, full of vendettas, personal codes, and contracted hits, but the original
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  game did a damn fine job. However, you can’t be expected to play a 2002-era game in this day and age.

  Which is why
  <em>
   Mafia: Definitive Edition

  is a godsend now available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You play as Tommy Angelo, a former cab driver who finds himself joining and rising in the ranks of the Salieri crime family. Tommy, and you as the player, prove your loyalty through various acts of service to the main mafia boss, Ennio Salieri. But, as you may expect, things start to unravel once loyalties are questioned and people try to extricate themselves from the crime-family life.

 <p>
  I know this all sounds like heavy stuff, but it’s an enjoyable as well as an engrossing time. The narrative is the key strength of the game, so if you’re looking for a story-driven title to occupy your time and scratch that Godfather itch you’ve now remembered you have,

  Beyond tweaked and updated version of these definitive 90s FPS titans,
  <em>
   Doom + Doom II
  </em>
  serves as the definitive classic
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  collection by packing in a laundry list of level packs and expansions — TNT: Evilution, The Plutonia Experiment, the Master Levels, and even John Romero’s Sigil are all included. You’re also getting local and online multiplayer, plug-and-play mod support for community content, and, as a cherry on top, the option to enjoy the original MIDI soundtrack or a modernized and remastered version of the entire score by shredmeister Andrew Hulshult.

  With Microsoft’s acquisition of companies like Activision and Blizzard, we’re just beginning to see popular titles from these publishers make their way to Xbox Game Pass. And while getting
  <em>
   Modern Warfare III
  </em>
  on the service has been all well and good, nothing oozes such volatile levels of excitement the way
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  does. So thanks to the addition of the
  <em>
   N. Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  to Game Pass’ library, that excitement is ready to hop, spin, and dash its way into our hearts.

  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  is a competitive tactical shooter with heavy hero shooter elements — there are quite a few different game modes, but it typically boils down to a 5-on-5 with teams alternating attack and defense. It’s a familiar format for any
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  veteran, but the focus on high-octane mobility and character abilities will definitely take some getting used to.

 <p>
  That said, the game hosts a rabidly competitive playerbase. In addition to conventional “Competitive Matchmaking,”
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  features a “Premier” queue and game mode specifically for players that are looking to go pro — so if you’re looking for an esports grind to get good at, this is the title to fill that void for you.

  <em>
   The Case of the Golden Idol
  </em>
  is an exceedingly clever murder mystery game that stages a series of horrible events players need to unspool bit-by-bit. The premise is simple: players are presented with an image of some ghastly event and a block of text where crucial information is missing that they need to fill in.

 <p>
  By poking and prodding at the image like a good detective, players start to uncover the names of people and places, as well as potential murder weapons and actions, that explain everything that transpired the day or night of the incident. It’s clever, satisfying, and its twisted world and events are so inventive, it’s impossible to put down.

  If you’re someone who is tired of FPS games frequently leaning toward the photorealistic and wish there were more that embraced a striking visual art style but still played phenomenally, have you met my friend
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  ?
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  is a must-play FPS game if you’re at all a fan of the genre. We know that’s a phrase that’s used a lot (we’ve probably used it ubiquitously in several entries here), but the flash and polish of
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  makes it more than worthy to be labeled as such.

 <p>
  In a dizzying blend of
  <em>
   Mirror’s Edge
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  pirouettes its way into the genre as a platforming shooter that has you racing as the main protagonist across levels, exterminating heaven-invading demons as you go. For each run, you must shoot all enemies as quickly as possible using the abilities at your disposal, and what follows is a dance of gunplay and traversal that makes you feel like a veritable badass.

  The story (a former denizen of Hell trying to earn a spot in Heaven) is fun, and getting to hear Steve Blum’s dulcet tones is always a plus. But the cream of the crop is the gameplay, which, as we said earlier, is a must-play phenomenon.

  Though it originally surfaced as a launch title for the Xbox One some ten years ago, this fairly straightforward third-person brawler wears its age fairly admirably — though that isn’t to say that it doesn’t wear it at all. It’s definitely an Xbox One game, but it’s a solid one.

  <em>
   Ryse: Son of Rome
  </em>
  slips you into the hobnailed sandals of Roman general Marius Titus, and… well, without spoiling too much, proceeds to unspool a plot more than vaguely reminiscent of the Y2K film
  <em>
   Gladiator
  </em>
  . In terms of story, it does the job, but it’s far from the game’s selling point — the meaty, visceral, highly stylized combat.

  On the tin, it’s a simple enough affair of timed prompts and quick-time events. It never gets too complex, but will certainly offer a challenge and manages to provide some depth with a series of unlockable “perks” that provide different bonuses upon defeating enemies.

 <p>
  The real kicker, however, is the sheer amount of visual flair that it manages to pack in and the fluidity with which it implements its systems into the visual effects. If you missed this one upon the Xbox One’s 2013 launch, it’s well worth the seven or eight hour spin to beat.

  It’s not often that a game comes close to matching the arena brawl perfection that is
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  ; that title has long been the bar that similar games strive to reach. Quite honestly, the first
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  was an absolute failure and didn’t come within miles of that standard. However, with this second entry, the unbelievable has occurred: we’ve gotten a brawler that feels unique, has fantastic, nostalgia-driven fighters, and comes leagues closer to that
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  mark.

  There is twice the polish here than there was before, and the inclusion of Slime-fueled ultimate attacks lends the game an extra bit of identity. And being frank once again, it’s just freakin’ cool to be Squidward slapping the heck out of Jimmy Neutron. We grew up on these cartoons, so getting the chance to play as them with such a silly fun concept is a blast. Plus, there aren’t many fighting games available on Xbox Game Pass, so this makes for a great addition to the library.

  The walking-simulator style of horror games we’ve gotten in recent years have been superb. And one of the most exemplary titles of this genre is
  <em>
   Still Wakes the Deep
  </em>
  . This game places you in one of the most unique settings we’ve been to in a video game, and a ripe one for scare potential. You play as Caz, an electrician aboard the Beira, an oil rig way out in the North Sea. Everyone working on the rig is pretty much isolated from the rest of the world save for some shoddy radio equipment, aged lifeboats, and one lone chopper.

 <p>
  This isolation, as you could probably guess, comes into play when the workers drill into something they should not have drilled into. As Caz, you have to navigate the crumbling rig and bypass these otherworldly horrors that begin enmeshing themselves within the infrastructure of the rig and your human coworkers. The performances in
  <em>
   Still Wakes the Deep
  </em>
  are absolutely phenomenal. No fake screaming here. As the people begin undergoing grotesque transformations, their howls, moans, and shrieks all feel terrifyingly legitimate.

  And while the minimal gameplay is not going to win any awards, it’s an enjoyable, albeit spine-tingling walk through what it would feel like if a Cthulhu-inspired infection/monstrosity broke out in your place of work.

  Work yourself to death. Or, well, a little ways past it. That’s the gist of
  <em>
   Have A Nice Death
  </em>
  . This slick little roguelike puts you into the tattered robes of an adorably stylized Grim Reaper — or Death — and tasks you with getting the whole business of the afterlife back on track. And it is very much a business, these days. Things have gone a bit wonky with Death Inc. and you, as the CEO, have a moral obligation to fix it with some… relatively aggressive micromanagement.

 <p>
  Which, naturally, entails taking up your scythe, spells, and a host of other potent tools and hacking, blasting, and platforming your way through disgruntled minions to get to the bottom of Death Inc’s management woes. The action’s pretty fast-paced — you’ll need to coordinate your dashing, jumping, and various attacks pretty effectively to make meaningful progress, but it’s pretty easy to get the hang of once you’re into the swing of things.

  Most of the game’s trappings aren’t reinventing the wheel. You have limited (but replenishable) heals a la
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , you’ll map your powers and equipment to a precious few limited slots, and spend currency on upgrades between deaths or at the occasional shop along the way. But where
  <em>
   Have A Nice Death
  </em>
  shines is in the tight gameplay elements, cutesy aesthetics, and naturally, the humor born of a corporatized afterlife. It’s bound to be particularly appealing if you loved Team Cherry’s
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , so give it a swing.

  Many were disappointed with
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  when it first launched as they were expecting a direct analog to
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  given that developer Striking Distance Studios’ Glen Schofield, one of the original co-creators of Isaac Clarke’s first adventure aboard the Ishimura, was behind the game. However, when you begin your first forays with
  <em>
   Callisto
  </em>
  , it’s clear that while some inspiration for the setting and monsters are apparent, the gameplay and principle behind combat is wildly different.
 </p>

 <p>
  You play as Jacob Lee, a man wrongfully imprisoned on the moon of Callisto at the worst possible time. An outbreak of something is turning the inmates into monsters, and you play as Jacob as he struggles to make his way out of Black Iron Prison. An intriguing premise, and when you first get control of Jacob’s movements, there’s this feeling that it’ll be just like walking in Isaac Clarke’s shoes once again. However, combat is a more measured affair, relying on timed swings with your melee weapon, dodging swipes from hideous monsters, and conserving ammo for when you encounter larger monstrosities. The fighting is more restrained, and the journey itself is far more linear.

 <p>
  Despite these differences,
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  is a more enjoyable horror romp than people give it credit for. The tension as you trudge through dilapidated prison corridors is vivid, and the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking despite the horrific surroundings. Both its linear nature and inclusion on Xbox Game Pass’ library lend added weight to the game’s approachable nature. So if you’re looking for another horror offering,
  <em>
   Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  is the perfect game for you.

  You might take one look at
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler’s
  </em>
  cover art, skim over a few screenshots, and assume that it’s nostalgia bait — a plainly-written love letter to JRPG enthusiasts stricken with the notion that it never got better than ATB battles rendered in 16-bit graphics. And really, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But you’d be doing yourself a significant disservice if you assumed that was the entirety of what this game is putting on the table.

 <p>
  Octopath Traveler wears its nostalgia trap on its pixellated sleeves, that’s true. But it wraps that core in several layers of modernized goodness that truly make it pop. Firstly, the entirety of the game is rendered in an initially disorienting (and eventually charming) 2D/3D design direction, with 2D sprites for characters interacting in 3D environments. It also sprinkles in a few decidedly “modern” graphical effects — just-modern-enough to give its mid-90’s aesthetic a modern sheen.

 <p>
  Upon getting started, the game immediately confronts you with eight overlapping character stories to choose from (each character resembling a different JRPG class trope, naturally), each with its own arc and satisfying conclusion. That said, having eight distinct character arcs to work through can be a bit time-intensive — but hey, those of us used to four-disc PS1 epics shouldn’t really find that to be an issue.

  You play as a small hermit crab who gets their shell “repossessed” by a Loan Shark (a talking shark head; it’s hilarious) on behalf of the Duchess of Slacktide. And thus begins your journey to reclaim your shell, find out what is going on in this deteriorating ocean land, and battle a heck ton of bosses.

 <p>
  To put it simply,
  <em>
   Another Crab’s Treasure
  </em>
  is a Soulslike with a cute visual style and a whopping amount of humor. When we first picked it up, we were not expecting it to be as charming as it was. But the heart of the game and its fairly deep yet still approachable mechanics make it a fantastic Soulslike game to try.

  Before even thinking about installing
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  , you should know exactly what kind of game you’re getting into.
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  is a glacially-paced, narrative-driven title that, on the surface, doesn’t say much. You’re following along the amiable yet bland Harold aboard the Fedora, an underwater ship that has been marooned on a watery planet for years.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":23,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":23,"nbrPlacementsScanned":23,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":369} -->
 <p>
  This station is full of quirky characters you can talk to and assist throughout the game’s runtime. And while there are a handful of fascinating gameplay moments sprinkled throughout, you’re largely just side-scroll-ambling down corridors to start mild conversations with these people.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":23,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":23,"nbrPlacementsScanned":23,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":668} -->
 <p>
  This all may sound like harsh critiques against the game, but
  <em>
   Harold Halibut’s
  </em>
  status as a hidden gem is enshrined between two pillars: its unique visual style and the unrelenting adherence to the themes it's going for. The handmade, stop-motion techniques on display are both delightful and impressive. There is no other game that looks like
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Similarly, there is no other game that is about what
  <em>
   Harold Halibut
  </em>
  is about. (I’m not going to spoil the plot.) So while there is a possibility you will play through the game and find it resoundingly boring, there is also a chance that the themes it’s trying to convey will just solidly land for you. And if they do land, they will land hard.

  Have you ever wanted to know what Josef Fares was up to before he worked on
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  ? Prior to those amazing, cooperative-driven titles, Fares worked on a small but ambitious single-player puzzle game called
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  . And to our delight, it’s been added to the Xbox Game Pass library. Even though this game is meant to be played by one person, you can feel the seeds of “cooperation DNA” in its bones.

  Each brother is controlled by one half of a controller, with one toggle moving the oldest and the other moving the youngest. At first, it’ll make your brain go cross-eyed as you acquaint yourself with this disjointed style of control, but as you stick with the boys’ journey to save their father, climbing mountains, causing diversions, and dodging enemies, it feels more natural.

 <p>
  As with many of Fares’ games,
  <em>
   Brothers
  </em>
  doesn’t overstay its welcome, with each section of the adventure lasting as long as it needs to before moving on to the next thing. And by the time the conclusion rolls around, you’ll find that this may be one of Fares’ most emotionally satisfying narratives yet.

  The
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  series has a whole host of fantastic games in its history, from the iconic title that started it all to the much-beloved
  <em>
   Tomb Raider: Legend
  </em>
  . And though we often see reboots that don’t do the original justice in the video game world, thankfully, Crystal Dynamics did not let us down with the beginning of its Survivor trilogy.

 <p>
  In this outing, Lara Croft isn’t the seasoned raider of tombs we’ve known for years, but rather an inexperienced explorer thrust into an incredibly dangerous adventure that will have her clinging to life (and a lot of cliff sides) more often than not. This rebooted
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  has you guiding Lara through some of the most harrowing situations you will ever see in a game. Not only does she have to unravel a perilous mystery at the heart of a lost island’s cult, she has to deal with armed thugs and terrifyingly sharp river debris.

  I kid you not, if you thought Lara Croft was a light-hearted adventure with a bit of “archaeology” thrown in, this Survivor reboot will catch you unprepared. Near the very beginning of the game, Lara needs to crawl through a literal tunnel of blood after she and her team crash-land on the island. It’s gritty, but fun, action-packed with a light sprinkling of puzzles, and a joy to run a completionist playthrough on. And while it might feel wildly different from classic
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , as you play it, you can feel the love and respect it has for what came before.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe, despite how oversaturated it may become with films, TV series, and games, is one that’s always ripe for new stories. One of the standout
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  narratives of the past decade was
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,
  </em>
  Respawn Entertainment’s adventure game that follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan who escaped the massacre of Order 66. That was a fantastic game in its own right, but its sequel,
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  , doubles down on those narrative chops.

 <p>
  The gameplay largely remains the same, with a Souls-lite style of lightsaber combat, platform puzzling, and open-world-ish exploration. But the story is seriously where
  <em>
   Survivor
  </em>
  shines. It’s not the typical galaxy-ending conflict that we’ve seen in this franchise before, but it’s got high emotional stakes that will keep any fan of the first game gripping their controller long into the night.

 <p>
  Cal has to confront some ideological differences between himself and others who, while still fighting against the Empire, aren’t exactly aligning with what he views to be the right course. And, as the story proves, surviving and keeping ideologies intact don’t always go hand in hand.

  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is probably the single most divisive point of contention for a lot of dedicated fans of the franchise — and deservedly so. At launch, the game’s many shortcomings, bugs, and awkwardly executed design choices were derided pretty heavily. With that said, it did establish one significant pillar for Bethesda to build upon: it created what was, for most intents and purposes, a multiplayer Fallout experience.

 <p>
  In the years since its unceremonious 2018 launch, the developers have had a lot of time to reflect, adapt, and course-correct — and all that tinkering has manifested in one of those from-the-ashes stories so rarely witnessed in today’s terminally online gaming ecosystem. In its current state,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is a pretty decent game, and a perfectly reasonable answer to the question, “What if
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  were kind-of an MMO?”
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":30,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":30,"nbrPlacementsScanned":30,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":444} -->
 <p>
  Now that we’ve spent entirely too much time on the preamble, the premise of the game is essentially summarized in the preceding paragraph. If you’ve played
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , then a lot of
  <em>
   Fallout 76’s
  </em>
  bones will be familiar to you. Largely taking place in the Appalachian region of West Virginia,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  sees your custom-made character emerge from the depths of Fallout 76 on “Reclamation Day” alongside your fellow Vault Dwellers and try to bring some semblance of civilization to the surface world while surviving its nuclear-ravaged wilderness.

 <p>
  It’s a solid translation of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  formula into a multiplayer format, complete with quests, NPCs, a number of factions both familiar and foreign, and that signature wasteland weirdness that makes the setting so special to begin with.

  If you’re looking for a relaxed, contemplative experience with just a dash of puzzle-solving, then it’s definitely worth stopping in to
  <em>
   Botany Manor
  </em>
  for a visit. Taking the role of Arabella Greene, you’re tasked with carrying out a bit of botany research in and around — you guessed it — the eponymous Botany Manor.

  Progressing through this surprisingly vibrant and colorful 19th-century estate is accomplished by way of researching and growing various fantastical flora. You’ll collect various clues for creating each flower’s ideal growing conditions, note them in a journal, and solve thoughtful, fun little puzzles to get them blooming. All the while, you can observe various bits and baubles fleshing out the life and times of Arabella.

 <p>
  The Skywind team has released another deep dive video that details their progress in porting the beloved island of Vvardenfell into
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Even among the ocean of mods that have made
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  into the ultimate Bethesda sandbox,
  <em>
   Skywind
  </em>
  stands tall as a truly ambitious undertaking. At its core, it is a remake of
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  built upon
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's foundation, but the scope of the project has since outgrown its humble roots and became something closer to a modern re-imagining.

 <p>
  While it is not the only such mod for
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , an argument could be made that Skywind is certainly one of the most anticipated. With over a decade of development, Skywind represents the ultimate collaborative project for creatives in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  community, as many modders have poured years of effort into making the mod a reality. However, a release date for Skywind has yet to be narrowed down.

  As part of the Creation Mod Con 2024, a recent deep dive was posted on the Skywind YouTube channel. Hosted by Overseer, Marco, NewtonsFourth, and Argyle, the video showcased a two-hour gameplay experience in Skywind, taking the players from the Sixth House strongholds in the northern Ashlands, across the Grazelands, and towards the territories of House Telvanni and House Hlaalu. The Skywind team set out to capture the unique charm of Morrowind, and even elevate it, and the results speak for themselves.

  Instead of simply porting over the dungeons and landscapes of Morrowind, the Skywind modders have attempted to build all the interior instances from the ground up – creating a new, modern experience while maintaining its original intent. Whereas
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  had very limited voice acting, even for its main storyline, Skywind is expected to be fully voiced by hundreds of voice actors from across the world. Furthermore, many features that were removed in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  – but were present in
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  – will be making a triumphant return, such as the art of spellcrafting.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  being 12 years old, and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  in active development, it could be argued that there is no better time to release Skywind than now. While areas such as the Grazelands are effectively finished, there is still plenty of work to be done. As a project, Skywind is being built with mod support in mind, and even after its release, other fans will be able to create smaller mods within its framework, such as player housing or even completely new areas.

 <p>
  There are rumblings that
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  may be hosting another one of its Nintendo Direct events this week. Nintendo's Direct events are special showcases where the company highlights upcoming games. Directs often contain both first- and third-party releases, with the main ones typically having a special focus on Switch exclusives.

 <p>
  There are a variety of Nintendo Direct events hosted every year. The main Nintendo Directs are the ones that generate the most hype from the community, but fans are also treated to Mini Directs, Indie World events, and Partner Showcases, the latter of which focus on games being made by third-parties for the Switch. Whatever form the next Nintendo Direct takes has yet to be seen, but there's a chance fans will find out sooner rather than later.

 <p>
  The latest rumors suggest that Nintendo may be hosting a Nintendo Direct event at some point before the end of August 2024. These rumors originated from PH Brazil, who has teased that a Nintendo Direct will be happening before the month is out. More recently, insider NateDrake took to the Famiboards forums to state that he believes we will see Nintendo coverage "soon" and that he expects the info to come via a Nintendo Direct. This doesn't mean that NateDrake is backing up the claims that a Nintendo Direct will happen before August is over, but it does suggest that Nintendo fans can likely expect some kind of announcement sooner rather than later.

  Shortly after the Nintendo Direct August 2024 hit the internet, Nintendo itself confirmed a special Direct presentation focused on its upcoming museum. This Nintendo Museum presentation revealed all kinds of interesting details about what fans can expect if they visit the building, but did not contain any news about upcoming Nintendo games. Some fans believed that the Museum video is what PH Brazil was leaking, but they have since indicated that it is not what they were talking about.

 <p>
  There is plenty of historical precedence backing up the possibility that a Nintendo Direct will take place this month. Almost every year, a Nintendo Direct has taken place in August or September, and there's no reason to assume that 2024 will be any different. Even so, it's best for Nintendo fans to keep their expectations in check until an official announcement comes from Nintendo. If a Nintendo Direct does take place this week or in September, only time will tell what it has in store. It's possible Nintendo will use such an event to finally show off the Switch 2 console, but it's also possible that it will keep the focus on the original Switch for now, especially since it's within striking distance of overcoming the PS2 to be named the best-selling video game console of all time.

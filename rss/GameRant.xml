      <title>Astro Bot Proves Not Even Sony Can Deny Nintendo's Impact on the Industry</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  may very well be one of the biggest surprises of 2024, unassumingly sneaking its way into this year's gaming lineup and already proving itself to be a worthy Game of the Year contender. A significant part of what has led to
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's rapid success is likely its bold pursuit of the mundane, taking players back to gaming's simpler days amid so many other titles attempting to redefine the industry with bigger and better-looking experiences. On that note,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  takes full advantage of the nostalgia of longtime Sony and PlayStation fans with Bots resembling the faces and images they've become familiar with over the last three decades.

  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  may only be Sony on the surface, however, as the fundamental building blocks of its core gameplay loop prove its inability to deny the impact that Nintendo has had on the gaming industry as a whole. It's impossible to play
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  without conjuring memories of Nintendo's classic
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  series, to the point that one perspective suggests
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  may have beaten Mario at his own game. In addition to these apparent
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  influences, there is a generous smattering of other mechanics clearly inspired by some of Nintendo's most recognizable franchises.

  Astro Bot's Platforming Mechanics and Level Design Are Reminiscent of Several Super Mario Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite being designed to showcase decades of Sony's history,
  <em>
   Astro Bot'
  </em>
  s gameplay wears its Nintendo influences on its sleeve. Most noticeably,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's platforming mechanics and level design are
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  through and through. Rather than drawing inspiration from classic iterations of
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  's platforming and level design, however,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  considers the philosophy and design principles of
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  's modern era, where the world is as much alive as the NPCs within it and players can progress through experimentation and occasionally shifting their perspective.

 <p>
  Some of
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's mechanics even mirror specific
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  games.
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's jetpack mechanics, for example, are almost identical to Mario's FLUDD pack in
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  . Specifically, when players equip the Hover Nozzle to the FLUDD in
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  , they can use it to cross large gaps and even stun enemies who get caught in the streams below. In the same way, players can use the jetpack in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  to hover across gaps and also stun or even kill enemies below the jetpack's flames.

  Astro Bot Also Uses Gameplay Mechanics From Nintendo's Pikmin Series

 <p>
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  isn't the only clear Nintendo influence found in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , as it also draws inspiration from
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  , from both a gameplay and a premise standpoint. The first
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  game saw Captain Olimar's ship crash-landing on an unknown planet. From there, players were required to befriend creatures on the planet called "Pikmin," and gather the parts of Captain Olimar's ship with their help. In
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , the bots' ship is torn apart by a strange alien, scattering pieces of it and its bots all over the galaxy. Players must then gather the remaining pieces at the Crash Site after rescuing bots from each world.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  is even more clearly seen in the way the Crash Site is navigated in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , as players seek out obstacles that require the help of a certain number of bots. Upon approaching one of these obstacles and pressing the action button, Astro Bot summons the required number of bots with a whistle, just as
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  's protagonist does to rally Pikmin. There are also hints of other Nintendo games found in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , like
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  , further proving the undeniable impact Nintendo has had on the gaming industry. If Sony can't even avoid being inspired by Nintendo in a game that's supposed to be about Sony, that says something.

  Crypto, a Recon character from the hit battle royale
  <em>
   <strong>
    Apex Legends,
   </strong>
  </em>
  may be receiving a nerf for his kit soon. Crypto recently received a buff with the launch of Season 22 in
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  that granted him invisibility, but this change has been rumored to have been too much and may receive a rollback in some form soon.

 <p>
  The launch of Season 22 for
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  was a divisive one, mostly due to the controversial changes to
  <em>
   Apex Legend
  </em>
  's Battle Pass that were being planned. Once this decision was rescinded, the hype for the new season grew, but the game suffered a turbulent launch for Season 22 due to issues with Ranked mode. In terms of content, Season 22 brought a new map, new weapon, and various balance changes to the game. One such balance change was for the often under-utilized Crypto. While Crypto is a powerful Recon unit, able to surveil from a distance, collect Respawn Banners at low risk, and has a powerful ultimate ability, using any of these leaves him incredibly vulnerable. Season 22 looked to rectify this by giving Crypto the ability to become invisible when he uses his Drone to make the player less exposed and defenseless when using his abilities.

 <p>
  As reported by Dexerto, Crypto is set to be hit with nerfs to his invisibility, according to
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  eSports player Hakis. Hakis claims Respawn itself told him that it is planning to nerf Crypto's invisibility "soon." The changes he received in Season 22 made him one of the most-picked characters in
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  , contrasting his underperformance over the last few years. The ability to go invisible when using the drone allows the Crypto player to worry less when scouting, but it has also resulted in an increase in "ratting" (a term used for players who spend most of the match hiding away) and sees Crypto being used in more aggressive ways by abusing the invisibility in times such as the final ring fight.

 <p>
  While there have been a lot of issues with various Legends in Season 22, the issues with Crypto have been from a more deliberate change. Season 22 of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  has seen bugs with Newcastle that made one of his upgrades non-functional, as well as bugs for Rampart and Vantage that made their ultimates invisible and silent. Meanwhile, the introduction of health bars to the game has been an indirect nerf for deception-based characters such as Mirage. The Crypto change is one in a long line that some players of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  are unhappy with, but time will tell if these changes will be reversed.

 <p>
  There is no official word from Respawn themselves whether this nerf is coming, but given how much Crypto's pick rate has increased and how many players are putting forward concerns about his new power, it's not outside the realm of possibility. Crypto has always been one of
  <em>
   Apex Legend
  </em>
  's more complex characters to play, and while the buff has made him more accessible, it may have been taken a little too far.

      <title>The Witcher 4 Gave Mass Effect 4 The Perfect Blueprint For Shepard's Role</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/witcher-4-geralt-npc-mass-effect-4-shepard/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The handling of Geralt of Rivia's involvement in the next iteration of the famous series,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  , has been on nearly every fan's checklist since
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's conclusion. The assortment of endings featuring Geralt and Yennefer hinted at a possible retirement of one of the biggest staples in fantasy gaming and television, sparking rumors of a 100-year time skip in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  . However, CD Projekt Red recently confirmed that the White Wolf will make another appearance in the upcoming title, albeit as an NPC, putting months of speculation to bed. Although it remains to be seen how this new dynamic for Geralt will pan out, other games in the same predicament, particularly
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , could employ a similar strategy to salute their past protagonists.

 <p>
  Like Geralt, Shepard is the face of the sci-fi giant franchise,
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  . Hardly any tale or plotline in the BioWare brainchild has existed without direct links to the protagonist's choices in the past. In such cases where the main character is intertwined with the overarching plot, in such a way that it's nearly impossible to separate their identity from the franchise at large, trying to flip the script and expand on the lore through another character's lens can prove to be a mammoth task. That's presumably why CD Projekt Red aims to soften this blow in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  by confirming Geralt's participation, and it's one that BioWare wouldn't be out of place to try in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Some narrative problems can be spotted from a mile away, and the manner of
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's conclusion immediately told of an issue on the horizon for CD Projekt Red. There were 36 unique finishing acts for
  <em>
   Witcher 3
  </em>
  , and more importantly, three epilogues for Geralt of Rivia, not counting the bad ending where he goes on a mission to retrieve Ciri's medallion and is swarmed by enemies (although his eventual fate is unknown). Two epilogues depict the White Wolf's retirement with Yennefer or Triss, while the last sees him wandering The Continent's open lands alone.

 <p>
  Paying closer attention to the plotlines available to the protagonist, it became clear that there was no epic comeback on the cards, at least story-wise. It's part of why rumors swirled for the longest time that Geralt wouldn't be in the next title -- because his character had exhausted the narrative provided by the developer. With the recent confirmation that
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  will feature him as an NPC, franchises in a similar pickle could well adopt the strategy and keep their poster character around for nostalgic purposes.

  Shepard Could Take On an Advisory Role in Mass Effect 4
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  is one of the first series that comes to mind in this scenario, especially since Shepard's heroics in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  almost uncannily mirror those of Geralt in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  . The sci-fi storyline had several nodes for players to explore. However, there was a catch. The perfect ending was the only conclusion that saw Commander Shepard make it out alive from the showdown with the Reapers, and it was only attainable if players had a certain level of Total Military Strength. As such, it's logical to conclude that the protagonist's role in the franchise's tale is at an end, similar to Geralt's.

 <p>
  However, removing Shepard, who is essentially the embodiment of
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  's story, is easier said than done, as CD Projekt Red has determined through its new stance. One way to take a page out of
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  's playbook is to bring the commander back as a hologram, akin to Avina's role as an information VI. Shepard could play a role in particularly high-stress situations where players must make a difficult choice, advising the best possible route. By design, the ex-protagonist would have to contain more personality than a simple VI interface, but it's a solution worth looking into. With such an approach, BioWare could craft a natural handover to the next main character, instead of starting a new tale from scratch.

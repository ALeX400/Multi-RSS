  The massive
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  community continually proves to be an incredibly creative one thanks to the countless awesome art projects often shared by fans, but one member of the community goes above and beyond with an oil painting featuring Mimikyu that they created themselves. Though fans of the
  <em>
  </em>
  franchise have been letting their artwork express their love for the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  world and its many inhabiting creatures for decades now, fanmade creations often take many unexpected forms, from reimagined Pokemon designs to Charmander-themed tabletop firepits.

 <p>
  Even nearly 30 years after the release of the original Gen 1 games, fans continue to put together amazing new
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -themed craft projects and creature concepts. Of course, player creativity is inspired and fueled in no small part by the new creatures, locations, and phenomena introduced with each new installment of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series of games, with concepts such as Mega Evolution, Paradox Pokemon, and regional variants showing fans new perspectives on Pokemon that none could have imagined 20 years ago.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans frequently show off their own impressive projects in the form of pixel art, crochet, or even woodwork, some skilled artists prefer to stick to more traditional methods. In this case, a remarkably talented artist known online as Stoneway933R has shared an oil painting of their own creation featuring Mimikyu, the adorable Ghost and Fairy-type Pokemon that has remained a fan-favorite since it was introduced in the Gen 7 games. Featuring Mimikyu as the subject alongside some fruits and a jug, the artwork shares some similarities with many other popular oil paintings, all while boasting a level of detail that would make it seem a fitting installment in the Kalos region's Lumiose Museum.

  Fanmade paintings such as this one are somewhat rare to see, even among a group as creative as the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community. That said, fans have produced many similar works of art over the years featuring a wide variety of different Pokemon. Ever since the concept of custom Pokemon fusions gained popularity many years ago, a lot of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -themed fan artwork has focused on mixing creature aesthetics and overhauling the designs of different Pokemon to envision what they might look like as different types.

  Such artwork is fantastic in its own right, and really highlights how creative fans can be with regard to creature designs. Unofficial Pokemon designs have seen a significant surge in popularity over the past few years with the advent of regional variant Pokemon and, notably, the introduction of Paradox Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  . Many
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  enthusiasts excited for the return of Mega Pokemon with
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  next year have also been busy creating designs based on popular predictions of new Pokemon species and forms that could debut in the series' next major installment.

   </em>
  </strong>
  with balance adjustments for main roster fighters and Kameo fighters alike. Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Johnny Cage are among the many characters adjusted by the

  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  was released in September 2023 as a reboot for the series and a sequel to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  and its Aftermath DLC. Just two months after launch, NetherRealm Studios released the first DLC character for the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  Kombat Pack, Omni-Man from
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  . Quan Chi made his return as the second DLC character in December 2023, followed by Peacemaker in March 2024, Ermac in April, and Homelander from
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  this month. NetherRealm Studios also continues to release new updates over time to rebalance the roster and tweak DLC fighters as they are released.

 <p>
  The June 27 update for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is available right now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC with a slew of character-specific adjustments. Firstly, NetherRealm Studios made adjustments to main roster fighters Geras, Havik, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Li Mei, Nitara, Reptile, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Kombat Pack DLC character Peacemaker. Some of the most notable changes include reduced damage scaling for Kitana's Square Wave and Enhanced Square Wave attacks and an overall damage reduction for Nitara's Must Feed attack. Peacemaker received the most adjustments out of the main fighters, with several changes to his Human Torpedo, Beautiful Bird Bullet, Ground-Air Offensive, Activate Force Field, and Anti-Gravity moves.

  Sonya, Stryker, Motaro, and Mavado are the only
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  Kameo fighters affected by the new update. Sonya's Leg Grab move receives a slight reduction in start-up frames and now hits Overhead instead of Mid. A bug involving Stryker's Grenade Toss was fixed, and his Kuffed move now has fewer frames of recovery and reaches further toward an opponent. Lastly, Motaro's teleport ability has been adjusted, and Mavado's base health value receives a buff from 200 HP to 250 HP.

  Takeda Takahashi will be the final DLC character for the first Kombat Pack, and

  players can expect more updates to be released over the course of the next month. Early access for Takeda begins on July 23, and all players will be able to purchase the character one week later, on July 30. What's more, leaks suggest

  </em>
  Kombat Pack 2 will feature six new characters, but NetherRealm Studios has not officially confirmed the DLC yet.

  There are a lot of
  <strong>
   horror titles available on the PS2
  </strong>
  , and players can expect anything when it comes to these titles. Some are popular stalwarts of the horror gaming universe, while others have slipped under the radar of many fans of spooky games. The monsters are grotesque, the combat is stressful (if available at all), and the scares are constant in these haunted classics.

  Sci-fi stories with rogue AI gaining sentience and questioning their allegiance to their creators is not a new and unique story in anyway, yet

  The AI in question, called Dorothy, was destroyed in the events of the first game, but players must still contend with her creations, the Galerians. The main character called Rion is called upon one last time to defeat the remaining Galerians. Though it received middling reviews, fans of anime and early
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games will enjoy the themes explored and the gameplay on offer, even if it won't scare them as witless as other horror experiences available for PS2 players.

  Considered one of the earliest survival horror games to be released for the PS2,
  <em>
   Extermination
  </em>
  may not go down in history as one of the most memorable horror titles in history, but at the time, it was considered an innovative and frightening game.

  Set in a remote base in Antarctica, players assume the role of marine Sergeant Dennis Riley who is sent to investigate a distress call, and finds extremely distressing events have unfolded within. There are more monsters than people within its confines, and the game places a large emphasis on survival. Despite his combat training, Dennis will spend more time running for his life than fighting, which only makes the threats he encounters all the more terrifying.

  This game would have flown under the radar of many gamers, though those that did give it a try would have found a diamond in the rough. Though it was a gem that could have used some polishing,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Curse: The Eyes of Isis
   </strong>
  </em>
  did still offer some scares and fun to players.

  Set in the year 1809, strange events have begun to occur in the British Museum after a gang of thugs stole one of the items on display, the Eye of Isis. A mysterious fog has rolled through the building, killing or transforming everything it touches. The game will take place for the most part in said museum, but
  <em>
   Curse
  </em>
  will also take players on trips to the coast and even the pyramids in Egypt.

  For those not in the know,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gregory Horror Show
   </em>
  </strong>
  used to be a CGI anime in Japan, proving popular enough to warrant a horror PS2 game. The gameplay is rather simplistic, which sees players gathering the soul bottles in the possession of the guests, who will flee with the bottle if they are spotted. More bottles will increase the number of guests and rooms, as well as increasing the difficulty of sneaking up on guests.

  Another Capcom hidden gem,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Glass Rose

  is a unique point-and-click psychological horror game. In it, reporter Takashi Kagetani explores an abandoned building with his friend before he is knocked out, and awakens seventy years in the past. To escape back to his own time, Takashi must explore every nook and cranny of the mansion, and speak to its inhabitants, unfurling the mysteries hidden beneath the tasteful furniture.

  Honeymooners Richard and Claudia embark on a shuttle to the Moon when supernatural forces cause engine failures within the shuttle as it comes to land, causing a deadly crash that kills many passengers who then become ghosts that flood the base. It's up to Richard to free the spirits that are now trapped in the base, without joining the legion of the dead himself.

  Most fans know that game tie-ins based on movies and TV shows tend to be about as successful as movie adaptations of games — which is to say, not successful at all. But fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The
   </em>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   <em>
    X-Files
   </em>
  </strong>
  may have been pleasantly surprised by this more than adequate
  <em>
   X-Files
  </em>
  video game, with a writer and actors from the show onboard for the project.

  Set during the seventh season of the show,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resist or Serve
   </em>
  </strong>
  aimed to deliver three 'lost episodes' into the timeline of the series, which all revolved around what the show is most known for: aliens. The writing and story delivered a frightening and solid experience, cementing itself as an excellent addition to the PS2's library of horrors.

  A direct sequel to
  <em>
   Siren
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Siren 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  returns with its episodic style game, and survival horror elements as the characters must survive the dangerous inhabitants of the island. While it retains the aspects of the heart-racing gameplay of the original, it loses some of the difficult and trial-and-error gameplay that plagued the original game, creating an altogether more pleasant yet terrifying game.

 <p>
  The game takes place on Yamijima Island, where the entire population vanished during a blackout in 1976. A journalist working on an article, a ferry containing a few other passengers, and a squad of soldiers all find their way to the island, where they are subjected to the dangers and horrors lurking there.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Thing
   </strong>
  </em>
  is from the minds at Konami, and the game acts as a sequel to the cult classic horror film. The player controls Captain Blake, who is sent to investigate a strange facility where concerning events are taking place. This game can be fairly challenging, but there are many weapons available for Captain Blake to blast through Walkers and Scuttlers.

 <p>
  Captain Blake also relies on adrenaline injections to keep his mind from cracking at the horrific beasts he continuously comes into contact with. There's a lot of nightmare fuel in
  <em>
   The Thing
  </em>
  , so it comes highly recommended for players who love strange, grossly held-together creatures.

  The game is set during the start of the virus outbreak in Raccoon City, and tells the tales of these characters as they try to make their escape before the situation spirals out of control. The game allows players to tailor their experience at the start of every episode. They can choose the difficulty level to make it harder or easier, depending on their personal experience. This makes
  <em>
   Outbreak
  </em>
  an impressively innovative title for its time.

  games, and the scary recurring villain, Scissorman, who is hellbent on chopping up his victims with the enormous set of scissors he wields. In the third game, the Scissorman is just one of the many terrifying villains players will have to face.

  Playing as the fifteen-year-old Alyssa Hamilton, a young girl with special abilities, players will travel through time to free the souls of those that have been killed, and defeat some monstrous villains along the way. The ambitious scope of this era-spanning storyline is truly impressive, especially considering the era in which it was released.

  A missing persons case, three concerned friends, and an overnight stay in a school: these are the main ingredients of this creepy survival horror title that plagues the PS2 to a somewhat tepid reception, but the game invoked enough scares to land it in the hall of horror game.

As the game progresses, they soon uncover an ongoing conspiracy that the school is kidnapping students to transform them into mutated creatures.

  <em>
   Cold Fear
  </em>
  is one of the best-looking survival horror games available on PS2, and its graphical prowess only adds to the gruesome imagery Hanson must endure. It's hard to imagine anyone being able to keep cool when trapped on a boat with killer flesh beasts, but Hanson is an ever-fearless protagonist who's strong enough to guide the player through the terror.

   <strong>
    Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
   </strong>
  </em>
  is something of a remake of the very first game, returning players to the familiar story of Harry Mason searching for his missing daughter in the series' famous city, Silent Hill. However, this game retains a unique identity by reimagining small portions of the plot, gameplay, and characters. It expands upon the original with five new endings, and by adding a new gameplay element in the form of psychotherapy sessions.

  <em>
   Shattered Memories

  feeling distinct enough from the original while maintaining enough familiarity for fans of the original to experience on a more recent game console. While it won't be remembered as fondly as the main staples of the series, like the second installment, for example, it is still well worth every second of a horror fans' time.

  The first installment in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fatal Frame
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise proved to be one of the scariest, bringing the legendary series of Japanese ghost horror to PS2 gamers. The first game puts players in the shoes of Miku Hinasaki, who searches for her brother Mafuyu after he goes missing in the haunted Himuro Mansion and falls headfirst into a world of terror.

  With a camera as the player's only means of defense,
  <em>
   Fatal Frame
  </em>
  is one of the most chilling survival horror games as players must confront the ghosts in order to banish them and survive. It's a novel combat aspect that has been replicated in other game series but to a lesser extent.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Manhunt
   </strong>
  </em>
  is another infamous PS2 game that was removed from the shelves in some countries due to how graphic the violent nature of its content was. Players control Cash, a death row inmate who was supposed to receive a lethal injection. Instead, he was only sedated, awakening to hear instructions from the mysterious Director, who promises him his freedom in exchange for him murdering the Hunters throughout Carcer City.

 <p>
  Thus begins Cash's murderous journey through the crime-ridden fictional city. Almost everything found in the city can be used as a weapon, resulting in a variety of executions that can be hasty to gruesome, and which show over-the-top levels of gore. The faint of heart and weak of stomach should be wary if they decide they want to step into the streets of Carcer City themselves.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Suffering
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a mind-bending journey, to say the least. The game has three possible endings, each with its own explanation for what happened to Torque's family. This dynamic makes
  <em>
   The Suffering
  </em>
  very easy to pick up again as players seek the truth of what exactly happened to their friendly inmate protagonist.

  One of Capcom's hidden gems,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Haunting Ground
   </strong>
  </em>
  offers a completely refreshing horror game experience compared to
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , placing a greater emphasis on the survival part of survival horror. Players take control of the mostly defenseless Fiona, whose only option to escape encounters is through running, hiding, or sicking her trusted canine companion Hewie on them.

 <p>
  While its gameplay is very derivative of titles such as
  <em>
   Clock Tower
  </em>
  , it still remains a well-established game with fantastic environments and an atmosphere that crushes the player with tension, wondering what new horror would await them around the corner. Even today,
  <em>
   Haunting Ground
  </em>
  still holds a special place in the hearts of its small but fond fanbase.

  <em>
   Resident Evil

  <em>
   Silent Hill

  Split into episodes and featuring up to 10 playable characters,
  <em>

  dives into the struggles of each of these characters as they grapple with the inhabitants of the island, confronting them with violence or being stealthy around them and making use of hiding spots. With its unique 'sight-jacking' mechanic to allow players to see through the eyes of enemies, Siren had many unique features and an interesting plotline, but unfortunately, some tedious moments of gameplay prevented it from reaching near perfection.

 <p>
  Toru Furuya has been recast in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is one of Atlus' newest projects, set for a release on October 11, 2024. The game is being developed by several industry veterans, perhaps most well-known for their work on the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  franchise. Katsura Hashino, director of the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series from
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  , founded Studio Zero in 2016, and development for
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio,
  </em>
  then-titled
  <em>
   Project Re:Fantasy,
  </em>
  was announced that December.

 <p>
  Atlus has suggested
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  will be a step in a different direction compared to the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games.
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  's director, lead artist, and composer are Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima, and, Shoji Meguro, respectively. Their work has defined the current look of the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  franchise, but interviews and press suggest a darker, more mature tone for
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio.
  </em>
  One strong similarity the game will share, however, is getting to build bonds with other characters and party members.

 <p>
  Atlus has announced that Toru Furuya will no longer be voicing any characters in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio.
  </em>
  This news follows the recent development that Furuya had an almost five-year-long affair with a fan that became physically abusive. In May, Furuya admitted guilt on social media, apologizing to the woman he harmed and stating he would spend the rest of his life atoning for his mistakes. In addition, Furuya apologized for tainting the image of the characters he represented. He has since deleted his social media account. Updates for recast characters in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  are expected to be announced in July.

 <p>
  Fans have expressed their disappointment with Furuya's actions. The 70-year-old actor has spent over 50 years voice acting, previously playing iconic characters like Yamcha in the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  series, Tuxedo Mask in
  <em>
   Sailor Moon
  </em>
  , and anime adaptation versions of Mario. Toru Furuya has also stepped down from roles in
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Detective Conan
  </em>
  following this news, but any plans to recast those characters are still unknown.

 <p>
  So far, there have been no changes to the expected October 11 release date for
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  <em>
   : ReFantazio
  </em>
  . It is likely that Atlus has plenty more to share with fans who are anticipating the release. Aside from showing up at the Xbox Games Showcase, players have been able to preview
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , noting the way the game takes further strides in directions that blur the line between a video game and an anime. It appears that Studio Zero will remain hard at work to ensure that the final product meets the expectations that fans have come to appreciate from other Atlus titles.

   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed the new Aquatic Paradise event, which will add shiny Ducklett to the game. Ducklett is a Pokemon introduced in Gen 5, and evolves into Swanna from level 35. Niantic added Ducklett's regular version during
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's fourth-anniversary celebrations, with its Swanna evolution also available in the game through evolution.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Pokedex keeps gradually expanding with the announcement of events, providing exciting opportunities for trainers to increase their collections with new critters. When it comes to shiny Pokemon, more than 50 critters have joined
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  since the launch of Niantic's game. This year alone,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Pokedex got more than 10 shiny Pokemon, such as Rowlet, Tsareena, and Emolga. This time,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has announced a new event, and another shiny Pokemon will debut in Niantic's augmented reality game.

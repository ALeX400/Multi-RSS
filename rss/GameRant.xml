   <em>
    Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium
   </em>
  </strong>
  has finally been released to players worldwide on Steam, and with it currently sitting at a Very Positive review score, it's easy to see the global launch is going very well for
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  . Naturally, the release has brought many new and long-time fans in to play the long-awaited sequel that has been exclusive to the CN region for the past year. Its updated graphics and stunning new artwork are a big upgrade from the first game, and it seems to be bringing more appeal from a wider audience.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a whole new story, gameplay mechanics, resources to manage, and much more,
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  can seem like a lot to learn for new players just starting out. Not to mention its diverse lineup of new and returning T-Dolls to choose from when building a team, each having unique pros and cons. Players may be tempted to pick team members based on character appearance, but choosing the right T-Doll lineup is crucial for ensuring success across its various missions, challenges, and boss battles.

  Tololo is an elite doll in
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  who is another solid option as a mid-range damage dealer against individual targets. Her abilities deal in both hydro damage and physical damage in the AR class of weapons, where she comes equipped with the Model Alpha AR.
 </p>
 <p>
  She has a varied range of abilities that use two types of damage respectively; hydro or physical, allowing her more versatility in combat depending on the enemy. Quite possibly the best part about this doll is her passive ability, maxing out her Confectance Index at the start of battle. If maintained at the end of her turn, it grants her another action, essentially allowing her two actions in a single turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Tololo is a strong damage-dealer with ARs, the downside is that her passive depends on having another Hydro teammate to be the most effective. That being said, having that Extra Action passive ability is a game-changer, even if it's only for a single turn. Together with her incredibly high-damage output, especially when using her ultimate, this doll is another great AR option for ripping through individual targets.

  Daiyan is an elite doll who was brought in during the Amidst Wings of Gray event, currently being one of the best options as both a damage dealer and utility doll for the team. She deals in physical damage exclusively, having no abilities that deal elemental damage. Using the AR class of weapons, she comes wielding the Type 95 by default.
 </p>
 <p>
  This T-Doll is notable for her high mobility, as well as her ability to dispel buffs from enemies, allowing her to remove one per turn from whatever enemy she attacks. This is incredibly useful in combat with elites or bosses who can have buffs that are unique and much stronger than the average enemy. This doll is unique in that she only deals in physical damage, meaning she has no element-related abilities like most other dolls. Though this isn’t usually ideal, her ability to destabilize enemies allows her to weaken them to a point where she can deal massive damage if used properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  As mentioned, Daiyan lacks the capability of dealing elemental damage and although her ability to destabilize enemies can make up for that, elemental damage is much more ideal as it can work synergistically with other dolls using the same damage type. Regardless, Daiyan is still one of the best options, able to output a solid amount of damage, as well as benefit the entire team with her ability to weaken enemies by lowering their stability.

  Makiatto is an elite doll introduced in
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  's Rhapsody Quartet event and is easily the best option as a long-range attacker with high damage output. Like some of the most iconic anime characters ever, she deals in freeze damage and uses the SR category of weapons, coming equipped with the W2000 SR by default.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her "Absolute Mental Defense" ultimate activates support attacks from allies, allowing them to counter incoming enemy blows. The ability’s key part is that it applies a self-shield, activating her alert effect and making her intercept any incoming attacks against teammates who are in her range. This ability is made even more powerful by the fact that the interception happens before the enemy’s incoming attack, allowing her to possibly eliminate them before they can deal damage to the target.
 </p>
 <p>
  Makiatto doesn’t really have any downsides to note, as she is currently the best-in-class option for an SR doll. Able to output high amounts of damage at long-range, while also providing some defensive support for her team in the process.

  Qiongjiu is an elite doll who is currently rated as one of the highest damage-dealing dolls in
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  , making her pretty much the go-to AR doll for offense, outperforming almost anything in her way. She deals in burn damage and uses AR weapons, coming stock with the QBZ 191 AR. Qiongjiu is one of those characters that might make new
  <em>
   Girls' Frontline 2
  </em>
  players consider re-rolling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qiongjiu’s Ultimate is a self-buff ability that focuses entirely on maximizing her damage output. It applies 3 stacks of Action Support II, +30% Action Support, and an additional Action Support, making her total damage multiplier go up to 450% per cast when at maximum Confectance Index. Adding to this, her ultimate has no cooldown, and the Action Support II buff doesn’t dispel, so it will continue to stack with repeated uses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, Qiongjiu pretty much has no notable downsides at the moment in
  <em>
   GFL2
  </em>
  . Although she doesn’t provide any team utility or support in her abilities directly, her incredibly high damage output is support enough in all situations, especially when it comes to Elite battles and boss fight challenges.

  Suomi is an elite doll who is currently one of the best offered in this tactical RPG and can be effective on nearly all fronts, especially as a supporter for the rest of the team. She deals in freeze damage and uses the Suomi KP-31 SMG by default. Aside from support, Suomi can also deal a considerably high amount of damage on her own, making her a good all-rounder to have in a team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suomi’s ultimate ability, "Snowfield's Radiance", applies a shield to all allies no matter where they are located on the map, allowing them to tank most regular attacks. This is especially effective if Suomi is kept safe away from the center of battle so she can constantly reuse her ultimate to continue shielding. The ability also recovers her stability, removes any debuffs, as well as cleanses the taunt debuff from all the other team members.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only downsides to Suomi right now are her smaller movement range and her abilities being mostly focused on defense rather than offense, but the trade-off is well worth it considering how powerful she can be in almost any team.

  features an expansive open world that players must traverse on foot to reach from one area to another. Since you'll be relying on walking, sprinting, and parkour while traveling, it's recommended that you increase your movement speed early on in the game. Players can acquire the Arcanist's Boots, a unique set of clothing that can increase the base movement speed, making traveling a little bit speedier. Here's how to get it.

  Players can find the Lighthouse
  <strong>
   west of Claviger's Landing
  </strong>
  in the Dawnshore area of
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . After fast traveling to the beacon in Claviger's Landing, keep heading forward, past the houses until you see a vaultable ledge on the left with some boxes stacked along the wall. Vault over the wall and head past the farmstead to spot the towering Lighthouse along the shoreline.
 </p>
 <p>
  After approaching the structure, you'll spot a ladder leading up to the exterior of the Lighthouse. You must start climbing the lighthouse as the Arcanist's Boots are at the top.

  Climbing the Lighthouse to reach the Arcanist's Boots is a little tricky in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . So, here's a step-by-step guide on how to climb it and all the collectibles you'll find along the way.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">

   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Players may switch to third-person mode as it can make the climb a little bit easier.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <ol>
  <li>
   After you climb up the ladder, you'll need to carefully move across the beam and parkour over the wooden platform.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you climb another wooden platform, turn around and walk up the planks leading to an elevated platform.
  </li>
  <li>
   You'll spot a platform above you that you need to jump up and grab to climb.
  </li>
  <li>
   At the top, you'll encounter a higher platform that you cannot climb directly. First, jump onto the roof of the lower platform on the left and then climb to the higher one.
  </li>
  <li>
   There's a crack in the wall with a tree growing out of it. Enter the section and grab the
   <strong>
    Golden Plaque of Promises
   </strong>
   Totem Fragment.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now resume scaling the Lighthouse by walking two sets of beams outside the broken wall to come across a skeleton. Loot it to acquire some valuable items, including
   <strong>
    Captain Henqua's Spoils Treasure Map
   </strong>
   in
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Now you'll need to jump across a series of gaps until you reach a ladder that will lead you to the top of the Lighthouse. Here, you'll find a chest that will reward you with the Arcanist's Boots in
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The Arcanist's Boots has a passive skill called "Lesser Quickness," which will
  <strong>
   increase players' movement speed by 10%
  </strong>
  . In addition to the movement speed buff, it'll also grant an item bonus to players which will increase
  <strong>
   health restoration from all sources by 5%
  </strong>
  . Overall, it's one of the best pieces of unique equipment you can get early on in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  .

      <title>Nvidia RTX: Top 29 Games That Utilize Ray Tracing The Best</title>

    Summary
   </h3>
   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Real-time ray tracing, like Nvidia RTX, guarantees more physically accurate graphics for visually stunning gameplay experiences.
     </li>
     <li>
      Many games, like
      <em>
       Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Wolfenstein: Youngblood
      </em>
      , benefit from ray tracing to enhance their visuals.
     </li>
     <li>
      RTX technology is advancing to make most games look photorealistic only seen in a handful of titles, like
      <em>
       The Witcher 3
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Cyberpunk 2077
      </em>

 <p>
  It was in 2018 when
  <strong>
   Nvidia
  </strong>
  revealed its real-time ray tracing technology for games, titled Nvidia RTX. At the time, many people thought it to be the next best thing for video games, while others felt that it was going to be a side thing, like Nvidia Physx. Fast-forward to 2021, it's been over two years since RTX cards hit the market and many new games have opted for the technology. This is why it's interesting to see how many of these games have used it to goodwill.
 </p>
 <p>
  RTX technology is all about real-time lighting, and its interaction with the environment. This doesn't always mean good visuals, but yes, guarantees more physically accurate graphics. As graphics cards become more and more advanced over time, ray tracing technology will reach new heights that will make most games look downright photorealistic, which is groundbreaking for obvious reasons. Players will have their minds blown once ray tracing technology reaches a level where pretty much every game will have it, but for now, only a handful of titles have managed to integrate this technology with great finesse.
 </p>

  <em>
   Having ray tracing as a toggle in-game is not an achievement in and of itself. It's only when the implementation is so good that players can immediately tell the difference between RTX On and RTX Off that one really starts to appreciate how far rendering technology has come in recent years. Games that use a lot of reflective surfaces are the best showcases of what ray tracing can achieve, whereas games where most of the environment is mostly opaque, like grassy terrain, it's very difficult for ray tracing to show its true value. Two new games that exemplify this have been added to the article to give players even more options to choose from.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon's Dogma 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been put through the wringer for its poor optimization, and most players should do their research to see whether this game has received enough updates to finally run smoothly on PC and consoles before taking the plunge. It's a shame since the combat of this title takes all the strengths from the first game and dials it up to a hundred.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's true that
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  may not be a looker compared to other big-budget AAA games, the ray tracing technology at play here does a great job of ensuring that the lighting of the game looks premium, which helps the graphics stand out even more. Players with systems who can support this state-of-the-art technology will get completely immersed in one of the best action
  <strong>
   games with ray tracing
  </strong>
  they can get their hands on.

  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  is a game that came out of nowhere and surprised players with a fun mix of parkour and zombie action. Fans were glad to see that a sequel was in the works that sported a bigger budget and would strive to build on the first game's strengths. While the story-heavy nature of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dying Light 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  didn't wow many fans, the moment-to-moment gameplay and familiar combat made it a worthwhile game to check out for
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bigger budget for this game could be seen in the title's amazing ray-traced visuals, which completely dwarfed the baked lighting and almost made it look like a second thought. Given the first-person viewpoint of this game, anything that enhances the player's immersion is worth sacrificing some FPS for, and the
  <strong>
   game's great ray tracing
  </strong>
  makes it a visual spectacle as players deal with harrowing zombies and the like.

  The fate of Tango Gameworks has sent ripples through the video game industry, with Xbox's decision to shutter this studio being criticized to the moon and back. Reports state that the studio's main project,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghostwire: Tokyo
   </em>
  </strong>
  , failed to meet sales expectations, even if
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  was a surprise hit that bagged a ton of awards. It's a shame, since
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  has a lot of strengths despite its open-world design being slightly uninspired.
 </p>
 <p>
  The visuals of this game are undoubtedly its strongest suit, featuring high-quality animations that are a joy to witness in first-person. If players enable this
  <strong>
   game's ray-tracing
  </strong>
  mode, they'll be greeted with an impressive visual display. This ensures that the city of Tokyo feels more moody and immersive than ever before as players battle ghosts and uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of this city's residents.

  The release of
  <em>
   Marvel's Avengers
  </em>
  made many fans fear the worst for the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Guardians of the Galaxy
   </em>
  </strong>
  game, which is perhaps why so many people weren't looking forward to this release. While this story-driven single-player game was released to poor sales, it didn't take long for public perception to turn after more and more people talked about the amazing nature of this game's narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat, despite being the title's weak aspect, still has many things that go for it. However, it's the story and characters that end up being the saving grace of a video game that knows how to bamboozle players and let players enjoy an intergalactic narrative for the ages. This, coupled with the
  <strong>
   game's great ray-tracing
  </strong>
  , makes it a veritable gaming feast that boasts both style and substance.

  <strong>
   <em>
    HITMAN World of Assassination
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the definitive Hitman experience, combining all of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 in a single package, updated and upgraded to work with the latest RTX technology. Players take on the role of the iconic Agent 47 to carry out target assassinations, using everything from Sniper Rifles to Gas Canisters to poisoned drinks. Planning out the perfect assassination in as short a time frame as possible without being seen is the sign of a true professional.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agent 47's targets are mostly found in crowded urban spaces, environments filled with reflective surfaces like windows. This is where ray tracing really shines, allowing players to appreciate the extent to which the technology can take games on full display.

  title. The focus on dated crafting mechanics and the dependence on scanning for efficient exploration took away a lot from Pandora's gorgeous landscapes, which come to life with the use of ray tracing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The biomes in Pandora are a treat to witness firsthand and one of the strongest aspects of the game. If a huge priority for a player is to witness a wealth of beautiful curated landscapes, then using ray tracing is downright necessary to make Pandora come to life in the best way possible, and to further the joys of James Cameron's

  A game absolutely bursting with style and atmosphere, it's easy to see why
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alan Wake 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the best video games of 2023. Remedy was at its very best when it developed this stellar survival horror game that isn't afraid to take risks. People who love Remedy when they're at their most creative will love just how unique and different
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  is.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's easy to see why fans can't wait for Remedy to churn out another game, especially with
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  essentially creating a shared universe for all Remedy games. With the critical success of
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  leaving many people impressed, fans can only hope that more AAA developers take the same risk that Remedy did in the creation of a unique story-driven adventure that is unlike anything players have experienced before.

  Many people are glad to see huge studios like Sony try their hands out on genres that most AAA games don't try to experiment with. Not only is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Returnal
   </em>
  </strong>
  a pretty excellent roguelike, but the story it tells is a captivating psychological horror drama that will keep players invested from start to end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Selene is a deceptively complicated character whose backstory is slowly revealed over the course of the game's narrative. Repetition is a common theme prevalent in both the gameplay and narrative of the game, showing just how underrated Housemarque's AAA roguelike game really is.

   <strong>
    A Plague Tale: Innocence
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an indie game that came out of nowhere and wowed people with its emotional story and excellent presentation. The idea of playing as two struggling survivors in a stealth-focused indie title during the Black Plague makes for a great time, and the sight of millions of rats hounding them every step of the way will be burned into the player's mind at the end of this experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, it was only a matter of time before this hit title would receive a sequel that is bigger, better, and bolder in every way.
  <strong>
   <em>
    A Plague Tale: Requiem
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an excellent sequel that wraps up Amicia and Hugo's tale in a bold manner, making for a spectacular story-driven journey that is rife with amazing visuals. The title supports RTX, becoming even more visually appealing if players turn this option on.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  doesn't really add all that much to the original game in terms of story, content, or even cosmetics. There are a couple of new suits players can unlock, the GOTY version DLCs and slightly better facial animations, but little else. The value proposition for this remaster lies almost entirely in how they have managed to elevate the graphical fidelity from the base game, primarily through the excellent implementation of ray tracing.
 </p>
 <p>
  For machines that can handle it, there are few things prettier than web-slinging through a hyper-realistic New York City as Spiderman. The easiest way to notice the effects of RTX is to stick to a window on a skyscraper and look at the reflection. It's like looking into a mirror.
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered
  </em>
  is a gorgeous game without RTX, but when it is turned on, it turns into pure eye candy.

  There was a time when the phrase "Can it run
  <em>
   Crysis
  </em>
  ?" became synonymous with video game meme culture.
  <em>
   Crysis
  </em>
  truly was a spectacle when it was launched, with CryEngine flexing its muscles as the next great video game engine in the industry. At the time, only the highest-end PCs could even think about running
  <em>
   <strong>
    Crysis
   </strong>
  </em>
  at its highest setting, with the game looking gorgeous.
 </p>
 <p>
  In many ways, the game itself wasn't a big deal as much as the engine was, but that didn't mean that the title wasn't fun to play through by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, with the advent of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Crysis Remastered Trilogy
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players can experience the magic of the first three games with a fresh coat of paint. Fittingly enough, this collection arrives with ray tracing support, carrying forward the proud legacy of these titles still running rather choppily on regular gaming hardware.

  Many people argued whether
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Space
   </em>
  </strong>
  really needed a remaster, to begin with. The title looks perfectly fine even now and many people argued that any visual improvements would be superficial, at best. However, the release of this 2023 remake ended up silencing any critics by looking gorgeous while also featuring expanded levels and tweaked combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make things look even better, players could turn on ray tracing to make the cramped halls of the USG Ishimura look even more oppressive and bleak. The graphics of this title alone justify its stature as a worthy remake, even if many people won't be enjoying this revamped lighting when Isaac's head is getting ripped off by a necromorph.

  The next-gen update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
   </em>
  </strong>
  updates the visuals in a way that makes this game look pretty modern. While this update had some rough edges that needed to be ironed out, there's no denying that this visual upgrade is a feast for the eyes. The ray-traced lighting and ambient occlusion genuinely look incredible, and players will be dumbstruck whenever they witness a picturesque sunset in this game. Rescuing Ciri can wait since appreciating this lighting and riding off into the sunset on Roach takes priority.
 </p>
 <p>
  If anything,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  is a great example of why ray tracing is proving to be such a mind-blowing piece of technology that can elevate any video game to new heights. It's been almost a decade since the game's release, yet it's hard to point out anything dated from a graphical point of view when players turn on ray tracing and have their minds blown by the incredible escalation in quality this game enjoys.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghostrunner 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes up the mantle from its predecessor and ups the ante in a big way. Players take first-person control of a futuristic ninja in a cyberpunk setting, wielding a powerful sword. Combat is brutal, but the frequent checkpoints make figuring out the perfect solution to a difficult encounter less frustrating than it has any right to be. The gameplay remains top-notch, the one-hit-one-kill mechanic is as satisfying as ever, and the parkour is just as exquisite as the previous game.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the aspects where
  <em>
   Ghostrunner 2
  </em>
  really shines is in the visuals. The futuristic setting lends itself extremely well to ray tracing, with the difference between having it on and off being night and day. The environments are beautiful without any RTX, but with it? They are absolutely stunning.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Portal
   </strong>
  </em>
  was a groundbreaking puzzle game that proved once again why Valve is considered to be the master of its craft. Players who want an excuse to check out this game once again can do the same with a free DLC for the game that adds ray tracing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exploring the test chambers of Aperture with this revamped lighting makes for a great time. The title still holds up to this day, and this visual upgrade makes a new playthrough feel fresh and interesting once again. The fact that a game as clean-looking as
  <em>
   Portal
  </em>
  can somehow look even better with the smart integration of ray tracing is a great endorsement of this technology.

  </strong>
  is a game with a pretty innovative take on DedSec recruitment, but the rest of the title is woefully lacking. It's a shame since this game actually took some innovative steps forward, but this came at the cost of the title regressing in several other departments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Watch Dogs: Legion

  also features ray tracing which makes the title look pretty astounding indeed. Players who want to mess about in an open-world game with beautiful visuals should look no further than

   <em>
    Shadow of the Tomb Raider
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the final title in the rebooted
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  trilogy, which was a disappointment for many players. The enhancement of underwater segments coupled with ray tracing technology certainly helps the title look brilliant, but that doesn't make up for its unimaginative gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the studio behind this game being sold off to Embracer Group, fans don't know what the future of the
  <em>
   Tomb Raider

  series is. Thankfully,
  <em>

  Many people were disappointed with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  upon launch. The game could've been something truly great but was ultimately held back by Ubisoft's cut-and-paste design, rendering it devoid of any creative zeal.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the game itself was undeniably very pretty to look at. Switching RTX on turns
  <em>
   Far Cry 6

  into a beautiful title indeed, with the various reflective surfaces in the game doing a great job of making the title look all the more realistic and engaging.

  The reboot of
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  was nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. So, it was only a matter of time before a sequel to the same was also released, and this appeared in the form of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Doom Eternal
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This title was essentially the first game but bigger, better, and more engaging. It helped that the graphics of this title were spectacular as well and could look even more unreal with the enhancements brought about by ray tracing.

  <strong>
   BioWare
  </strong>
  isn't enjoying the greatest time in the industry right now. The lack of compelling original titles has many fans worried about the developer's future, especially since they used to have no problems enticing players with their amazing stories and memorable characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite these issues, there's no denying that BioWare has developed its fair share of stellar video games that fans can't get enough of. Almost every game developed by this company features real-time combat, with some being more engaging and cathartic than others.

  While the original
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  was fun to play in its own right, it wasn't until the release of the sequel that the full potential of the combat system could be achieved. Magic is more important than ever before, and party members are more durable than before.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means that players are encouraged to take risks with their party members while also employing the skills and abilities required to get through hard-as-nails encounters. The real-time combat is tactical and engaging as players slowly get stronger and try to stop the compelling villain Jon Irenicus from achieving his diabolical plans.

  Even after the many years that have passed since the release of

   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , fans still love the game's strategic combat. Players must be careful about the build they're pursuing as they master an array of powerful abilities to take out the myriad of foes in their way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Warriors should be on the frontlines to serve as tanks. Rogues should use their stealth capabilities and high DPS to quickly kill foes. Finally, mages should stay at a distance and use an array of elemental attacks to make their enemies squeal. If the real-time combat gets hectic, fans can always pause the gameplay and issue individual commands to make things easier for themselves.

  <em>
   Jade Empire
  </em>
  is one of the most underrated BioWare games, and more people should check it out. This wuxia RPG is unlike anything else out there, and it's a shame that BioWare didn't find this IP promising enough for more sequels.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combat in this title involves a ton of martial arts stances that must be switched out from time to time to target enemy weaknesses. As players acquire more abilities to overwhelm their opponents,
  <em>
   Jade Empire
  </em>
  becomes a blast to play through as the protagonist becomes a powerful martial artist who can best their master in combat by the end of the game.

  While many people weren't huge fans of
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  for its lackluster ending, the gameplay is a different matter altogether. Fans were impressed by how great it felt to rain hellfire on their enemies, with Shepard using a wealth of unique abilities based on their class to make combat even more exhilarating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using Biotic powers to propel Shepard's body forward and slam against foes never gets tiring, especially if players have a shotgun to punish enemies at a close range. Along with this, players can command their squadmates to pull off special moves of their own in combat, adding a simple layer of strategy to every combat encounter that players can rely on if things get dire.

  After the lackluster release of

  ' strengths instead of trying to appeal to mainstream audiences. Thankfully, despite the problems
  <em>

  Along with an epic story, combat in

  Fans eagerly anticipating the launch of
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  were left with a bitter taste in their mouths after a botched release full of bugs and other issues. While these were eventually patched, the lack of urgency in the story, coupled with the lackluster writing of each character, turned
  <em>
   Andromeda
  </em>
  into the worst
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  game by a country mile.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, players who managed to ignore its faults were pleased by the improvements made to the series' combat. Players could use jetpacks to fly around combat arenas and decimate enemies in style. These dynamic encounters coupled with some impressive abilities make it clear why combat is one area where
  <em>
   Andromeda
  </em>
  is a massive upgrade over its predecessors.

  People were worried about the release of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , especially with pre-release trailers forsaking the dark edge that made previous
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games such a blast to play. Unfortunately, the milquetoast writing meant that players struggled to get invested in a story where things just had to stay upbeat no matter what.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans were also worried about the action-oriented approach of combat where they couldn't control other party members. However, this is an area where BioWare didn't disappoint. Their modern combat systems have always been action-packed, and the expansive suite of abilities that Rook has access to in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  turns them into a whirlwind of death at higher levels. Players can zip around the battlefield in high-stakes combat encounters and showing enemies who's boss.

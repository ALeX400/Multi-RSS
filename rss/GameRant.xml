   <strong>
    Space Marine 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  rewards players greatly for prioritizing melee combat as it helps recover both health and armor. While ranged combat is very useful and can keep you from taking any damage in the first place, running head first into a swarm of enemies can not only heal you but take them out in a brutal fashion.

  There are many stats to a melee weapon that players should consider as each one will help that weapon fight a specific type of enemy. One stat that can be found on a melee weapon is its Cleaving Potential; here's exactly what that means and what it does on a weapon.

 <p>
  Cleaving Potential is how effective that weapon is at cutting through multiple enemies in a single swing. The
  <strong>
   higher the Cleaving Potential, the wider the area of damage done
  </strong>
  , making it ideal when dealing with larger groups of enemies. Cleaving Potential doesn't determine the damage done, so it doesn't matter how many enemies you hit in a single swing, as they all receive the same amount of damage.

  The bar found towards the

   bottom of the melee weapon's stats also represents how good it is against either singular enemies or groups

  . While Cleaving Potential isn't the only factor that determines a weapon's location on that bar, it is one of the most important.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Thunder Hammer has the highest Cleaving Potential at a 6
  </strong>
  and is far ahead of even the next best option of a Power Fist of 4+. These two weapons have the highest Cleaving Potential and will hit many enemies in a single swing, though those swings can be fairly slow. The Chainsword and Power Sword
  <strong>
   both have a Cleaving Potential of 4
  </strong>
  and have much faster attack speeds, depending on the stance you are using with the Power Sword.

 <p>
  It ultimately comes down to which play style you prefer, as longer and bigger swings hit more enemies at once, while quicker swings hit fewer enemies at once but you can fit more in quickly. The only melee weapon that has a terrible Cleaving Potential is the
  <strong>
   Combat Knife, with a Cleaving Potential of 2
  </strong>
  . While this weapon may not be good against swarms of smaller enemies, it can be very useful in PVP or a boss fight when you are focusing on only a single enemy.

      Legendary Pokemon often have signature moves, giving them advantages in battles.

      Some Box Art Legendary Pokemon, like Zekrom and Reshiram, have paired signature moves.

     <li>
      Yveltal's signature move, Oblivion Wing, is unique because it restores HP with its draining effect.

  Legendary Pokemon have their own set of characteristics that differentiate them from regular Pokemon: they are usually stronger, have some relation to the lore of the world and most of them have their own unique move that no other creature can learn, which are known as
  <strong>
   signature moves
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  After 9 generations, Game Freak has created over 70 different Legendaries, and almost every single one has their own signature move that gives them a major advantage in battle. But what is the best in the entire franchise? Keep in mind that this list is exclusively about Legendary Pokemon and will not take Mythicals into account.

 <p>
  Giving Legendary Pokemon signature moves is a more recent tradition in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise, and thus, many classic Legendaries don’t have a unique move of their own. Mewtwo was a perfect example of this, until Generation Five, when Game Freak gave it the signature move it always deserved, called
  <strong>
   Psystrike
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This is basically a stronger version of Psyshock, which was introduced in the same game since it inflicts a lot of damage, but it uses the target’s defense in order to calculate the total amount. Psystrike is an impressive attack that plays to Mewtwo’s strengths, and it has a small unexpected twist that can take any opponent by surprise.

 <p>
  In Generation Four, the fighting mechanics of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise were completely altered, since now the category of a move doesn’t depend on its type anymore. Ho-oh greatly benefited from this change, as this Legendary Pokemon always had a higher physical Attack stat, and now it could finally use
  <strong>
   Sacred Fire
  </strong>
  to its full potential.

 <p>
  This is just a very solid Fire-type move with great power and accuracy, but the thing that makes it truly special is its 50% chance of burning an opponent. This status condition always reduces the enemy’s Attack stat by half, so Ho-oh will always gain an advantage from using its signature move multiple times. Weirdly enough, Entei can also learn Scared Fire from Generation Seven onwards.

 <p>
  It is common for pairs of Box Art Legendary Pokemon to have signature moves that are variations of each other. Zekrom and Reshiram from
  <em>
   Pokemon Black And White
  </em>
  are no exception, seeing as they can learn two of the strongest and most impressive moves in the game:
  <strong>
   Bolt Strike
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Blue Flare,
  </strong>
  respectively.

 <p>
  Zekrom is a Dragon and Electric Type with a higher physical Attack stat, while Reshiram is a Dragon and Fire Type with a higher Special Attack stat, so their respective signature moves are designed around these specifications. As a result, they are incredibly powerful and useful, although their accuracy of 85% is a minor drawback.

  The Box Art Legendaries of
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet And Violet
  </em>
  , Koraidon, and Miraidon, have a lot of small differences and which one is better depends mostly on the player’s preferences. However, there’s one aspect in which Miraidon is definitely superior to its prehistoric counterpart: its signature move.

  <strong>
   Electro Drift
  </strong>
  deals a lot of damage that is increased if it’s super effective against its target, but it has one major advantage over Collision Course: it benefits from its user’s signature ability, Hadron Engine, which creates an Electric Terrain that boosts its power even further. Whereas Collision Course is not affected by the sunlight that is summoned by Koraidon’s Orichalcum Pulse.

 <p>
  Despite its intimidating name, Yveltal’s
  <strong>
   Oblivion Wing
  </strong>
  is
  <strong>
  </strong>
  actually quite a deceitful move. At first glance, it may seem odd that it’s a Flying Type move instead of a Dark Type move, but it also has a base power of 80, which is somewhat disappointing when compared to other signature moves of Legendary Pokemon.

 <p>
  However, like the mischievous Pokemon it is, Yveltal has an ace up its sleeve: Oblivion Wing restores its HP every time it uses it on an opponent, and it’s even the most powerful HP-draining move in the entire franchise. Not to mention that its typing is also quite beneficial, since Yveltal's main rival, Xerneas, can resist Dark Type attacks, but receives neutral damage from Flying Type ones.

 <p>
  While a base power of 100 is undoubtedly quite good, it’s not as powerful as the signature moves of other Legendaries. However, these two attacks more than make up for their lack of power with their secondary effect, since they can also completely ignore their target’s ability. Because of this, Solgaleo, Lunala, and Necrozma are already quite useful in regular playthroughs, but they really stand out in the competitive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  scene.

  It’s very uncommon for two Legendary Pokemon from two completely different generations to have similar signature moves that are variations of each other. But, oddly enough, this is exactly what happened to Lugia from Johto and Palkia from Sinnoh, who can learn
  <strong>
   Aeroblast
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Spacial Rend
  </strong>
  respectively.

 <p>
  Both of these moves are not only very strong, but they also have an increased critical hit ratio that makes them even deadlier. It would be expected for both of them to have at least one drawback in order to create some balance, but, aside from having an accuracy of 95% (which barely makes a difference), Aeroblast and Spacial Rend are just solid signature moves that Lugia and Palkia should always have at their disposal.

  Ever since it was introduced in
  <em>
   The Crown Tundra
  </em>
  DLC pack, Calyrex has made a huge impact on the competitive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  scene. Its regular form may not seem all that impressive, but its Ice Rider and Shadow Rider forms give it an incredible boost in stats and useful secondary types. But the biggest advantages of these two forms are their respective signature moves.

 <p>
  Ice Rider Calyrex can use
  <strong>
   Glacial Lance
  </strong>
  , while Shadow Rider Calyrex can use
  <strong>
   Astral Barrage.
  </strong>
  Aside from their category and typing, these two moves are almost identical. They are not only efficient because of their immense base power, but also because they can deal damage to all the targets on the opposite side of the field, which is extremely important in most competitive formats, in which Double Battles are preferred.

  Xerneas is the only Box Art Legendary Pokemon who learns a signature move that doesn’t deal any damage. But this is far from disappointing, because
  <strong>
   Geomancy
  </strong>
  actually ended up being one of the most influential moves in the entire franchise, and it helped Xerneas become a major threat among competitive players.

 <p>
  Geomancy raises its user’s Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by two stages, which transforms the Life Pokemon into a dangerous special sweeper. Of course, it normally takes two whole turns to execute this move, which may seem like a disadvantage at first. But skilled trainers like to give Xerneas a Power Herb, an item that negates this effect. Geomancy’s popularity is a sign that Game Freak should make more status moves for future Legendary Pokemon.

  Just like Groudon and Kyogre, Rayquaza didn’t have a signature move back in Generation Three but was eventually given one in
  <em>
   Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
  </em>
  , where it can now learn
  <strong>
   Dragon Ascent
  </strong>
  , the best signature move that a Legendary Pokemon can ask for. This attack is incredibly strong and, while it lowers both of its user’s defensive stats after it's used, Rayquaza is so fast and powerful that this drawback doesn’t really make a difference.

 <p>
  But the best aspect about Dragon Ascent is that it allows Rayquaza to Mega Evolve, instead of having to hold a Mega Stone. For years, Mega Rayquaza was infamous for being the most overpowered Pokemon in the franchise, and it made good use of Dragon Ascent. But even if Mega Evolution is not available in newer
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, the regular form of the Sky High Pokemon still terrorizes players, mostly due to its effective signature move.

      In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the game world remains active even when the player isn't playing, leading to unexpected and humorous encounters.
     </li>
     <li>
      For example, a player recently witnessed their Villager Marina behaving suspiciously near a knocked-out Gullivarrr, sparking a crime mystery.
     </li>
     <li>
      Despite Marina's suspicious actions on the menu screen, the 'evidence' isn't actually something to take seriously, as Gullivarrr is known for being thrown overboard by his crew and can't be attacked by Villagers.

 <p>
  Since the first
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game was released, the series has featured Villager characters that interact with the world around them whether a gamer is playing or not. This is enabled by the in-game clock and tasks that Villagers are programmed to do. When players load a fresh instance of their
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  island, the logo is displayed above in-game footage that follows one of the characters. Villagers can be found anywhere on the island, including inside
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  ' Nook's Cranny, the Museum, the Able Sisters, or their homes. However, one gamer has spotted their Villager Marina suspiciously walking away from an unconscious Gullivarrr.

 <p>
  Reddit user SamFromSolitude recently shared an
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  clip focusing on Marina when their island loads. Marina is immediately seen standing over Gullivarrr before she turns around and hides behind her Rainbow Umbrella next to a beach house. Other than the player, Kapp'n was also a witness to the event. Marina is a classic Villager with the Normal personality in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , and she's known to sing without needing a stereo. This combination may make her unsuspecting to other Villagers in a crime mystery story. Although some players ignore Gullivarrrr when he's washed up on the beach, this introduction may have inspired the Reddit user to interact with him.

 <p>
  Despite Marina walking away from the crime scene, Gullivarrr is known for being thrown overboard by his crew. This obviously makes it unlikely that Marina was involved in any way, but her suspicious act may be why SamFromSolitude thought something else happened as they logged in. While Gullivarrr offers his own pirate-themed
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  loot, players are most likely familiar with his standard form as Gulliver. Gulliver has been featured in the series since the first game, and he rewards players with world landmark-related items for helping him. This used to involve simply waking the seagull from his beach slumber, but it requires digging up or diving for Communicator parts in
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  .

  As
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons

  Villagers act in specific ways, it's unlikely that Marina even interacted with the passed-out Gulivarrr. Fans anticipate a sequel to release on the Nintendo Switch's successor that may expand on Villagers' activities, and if it does, perhaps genuine interactions between Villagers and Gullivarrr will be introduced.

  The majority of the campaign in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  involves landing in a Tyranid-infested zone and using your arsenal of weapons to tear your way through the alien bugs. However, the game may sometimes put you in scenarios where you'll be compelled to focus on more than just shooting Tyranids,
  <strong>
   such as ensuring your survival or protecting an objective from alien attacks
  </strong>
  .

  A similar situation occurs towards the end of the
  <strong>
   Skyfire mission
  </strong>
  , the first formal mission in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  , where you're tasked with defending four antennas from gargoyle swarms. Failing to defend even one of the four antennas automatically leads to mission failure. If you've been stuck trying to accomplish this objective, the following guide offers strategies and tips on how to survive the Tyranid assault and successfully complete the mission.

  As you near the conclusion of the
  <strong>
   Skyfire
  </strong>
  mission,
  <strong>
   Titus and his squad must fend off a gargoyle swarm attacking four targeting antennas
  </strong>
  . What makes this objective particularly challenging is that as you defend the first antenna, subsequent swarms will flock up on other antennas, making the objective challenging. Unfortunately, your AI squad mates aren’t very effective at protecting other antennas while you're focused elsewhere, leaving you to defend all four antennas on your own — a situation that can become frustrating on higher difficulties.

 <p>
  Each targeting

   antenna has its own health/integrity bar

   : Watch out for Tyranids that disrupt you with ranged attacks. As soon as you get a cue that a ranged enemy is nearby, prioritize eliminating it before returning to defend the antennas.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Use Ranged Weapons
   </strong>
   : The platform where you defend the targeting antennas is quite large,
   <strong>
    requiring you to sprint between antennas to protect them from the gargoyles
   </strong>
   . However, using ranged weapons allows you to defend the antennas from a distance.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Use Explosives
   </strong>
   : Fortunately, the targeting antenna platform provides opportunities to restock on ammunition and explosives, ensuring you have the firepower needed to take on the Tyranid forces. Grenades and grenade launchers are particularly effective for quickly dispatching swarms.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Stay On The Move
   </strong>
   : As you defend the targeting antennas, you'll also have to deal with Tyranid forces attempting to slow you down. However, if you move around the platform and avoid standing still, you'll improve your chances of not getting swarmed and focus on the antennas.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lower The Difficulty
   </strong>
   : If you’ve started the campaign on a challenging difficulty, you might consider lowering it for this part of the mission. Playing on a
   <strong>
    lower difficulty will reduce the damage you take while allowing you to deal more damage in return
   </strong>
   . This can help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed as you manage your health and ammunition.
  </li>

    Key Takeaways

   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Silent Hill 2 Remake and Slitterhead are set to compete as notable horror games in October and November 2024.
     </li>
     <li>
      Both titles share a design lineage and other similarities, but may risk player fatigue due to their close release dates.
     </li>
     <li>
      Fans could receive two memorable horror titles this season if both are able to execute their visions well.

  As
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill 2 Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  edges closer to release later this Fall, fans have continued to be somewhat divided on the direction of Konami and Bloober Team's reworking of the groundbreaking survival horror classic. From what
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  has shown about its modern version so far, it seems that it will veer a bit further than many thought in its reimagining of the 2001 original. Still, it has been highly awaited since its reveal in 2022, and many players are at least curious to see how it will turn out and hopefully honor its legacy for the current generation.

 <p>
  In an interesting parallel, Bokeh Game Studio's upcoming debut,
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  was announced in 2021, and happens to share a number of characteristics with the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  . Most notably, it will be a new horror IP headed by Keiichiro Toyama, the original creator of
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  . Given their proximity in overall design and release dates, it looks like the two titles might be shaping up to be fierce competitors, and fans of the genre could be in for a satisfying time if both are able to live up to their expectations and potential.

  Silent Hill 2 Remake and Slitterhead Are Two of the Highest Profile Upcoming Horror Games of 2024
 </h3>
 <p>
  On top of being third-person psychological action-horror titles releasing during the traditional window of the creepy season,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ​​​​​​​share a closer connection between them as above via their respective lineages. This makes the situation more intriguing, since those fans who are already invested in the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  series are also very likely to be interested in what Bokeh and Toyama have been cooking up with
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  . Both thus hold great promise to deliver memorable experiences and continue the trend of excellent horror games coming in the latter part of the year, as 2023 saw some of the best titles in recent memory in this area. ​​​​​​​While
  <em>
   SH2 Remake
  </em>
  arguably has more pressure on it, many eyes are on both, and they will almost certainly be directly compared, with one possibly emerging as the "winner" depending on reception.

  Slitterhead and Silent Hill 2 Remake's Timing Could Be Either a Trick Or a Treat For Horror Fans
 </h3>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  dropping a mere month apart, this could end up quite a boon for gamers, resulting in a back-to-back set of horror games that are equally engaging. On the other hand, it may create a sort of divide, since the tighter schedule might just as easily result in fatigue, as there are also a few other titles to come around the same time. Some other factors may contribute to the success or lack thereof for either. For example,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  will supposedly be longer than the original, and while this could entail some improvements, it also could work to its detriment by over-indulging and watering down the experience, a concern that has previously been expressed.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, even with Toyama's name attached, as an untested IP entering a highly popular sector,
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  could still be overshadowed somewhat and lose some steam with audiences. Given their resemblances in gameplay and adjacent visions, though, the stage is set for them to face off, and it will be interesting to see if one ends up taking the cake over the other. The optimal outcome, of course, would be that both are able to deliver worthwhile experiences in their own right, and keep the genre going strong by giving fans a great double feature for this year's spooky season.

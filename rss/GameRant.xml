  <strong>
   <em>
    The Rise of the Golden Idol
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues the story that began with
  <em>
   The Case of the Golden Idol
  </em>
  , although the sequel was designed to be a stand-alone adventure that players can enjoy without experiencing the original title. The point-and-click, drag-and-drop gameplay remains the same, with players collecting lists of words and determining their correct placement in a variety of texts, notes, and stories.

  The game consists of several chapters, each progressively longer and more difficult than the next, so it helps to have a specific guide in addition to the hints already provided. Chapter Two includes a total of four chapters and is mostly exposition regarding the origin and whereabouts of the coveted Golden Idol.

  There's a lot to take in at the auction house, where there are all kinds of shenanigans that happen when the lights are out. Not only does the player have to sleuth their way through two screens, but each of those screens has a daytime and a nighttime version. Players can change this back and forth using the clock faces on the upper right.

      Skyrim remains popular since its 2011 release, with over 60 million units sold.

     <li>
      Some glitches, like a bleeding floor, continue to surprise players exploring the game's vast open world.

 <p>
  A player has recently discovered an extremely weird glitch in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  that made their house’s floor bleed. Despite being one of the most popular games ever made,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is known for having many glitches, which can often be strange or hilarious.

 <p>
  Originally released in 2011,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim
  </em>
  is still widely played today. Over the years,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  sold over 60 million units, and it has been released for multiple platforms. However, due to the huge scope of the game’s open world, some glitches are bound to continue happening, despite several patches.

 <p>
  Now, one
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  player called carl84 shared a really weird bug that they found in their house in Windstad Manor: the floor was bleeding. The post obtained over 12,000 upvotes, as the community became intrigued by the unique glitch, which does not seem to be very common. According to people in the comments, however, the cause for the glitch is very likely to be mundane: there’s seemingly a dead NPC under the house’s floor. Somehow, one NPC either spawned or phased through the floor and likely died there, and is constantly spraying blood all around due to being constantly “hit” by the floor.

 <p>
  This is far from the first time that a player has discovered a bizarre bug in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , though, as the game is essentially filled with them. Earlier this year, for example, a hilarious
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  glitch gave an NPC a horse’s head. While the reason for the glitch was not detected by the poster, it was likely that a soldier’s helmet spawned the wrong texture, loading a horse's head instead.

  Another noteworthy glitch that happened recently was uncovered when a
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  player was threatened by a fish. In this post, one gamer found a slaughterfish while playing
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , which told them that “Your death has been foretold.” This was not part of any quest or an Easter egg. Curiously, the glitch seemed to also happen to other players, who revealed that they had previously encountered it.

 <p>
  More recently, a
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  player managed to get inexplicably low Speech due to a bug. This gamer was playing Skyrim normally when they noticed that their Speech skill was at -999975, an absurdly low value that should be possible to achieve. Despite using a character with such low Speech skills, the game was still playable for the gamer. However, it was very hard to bribe guards, for example, due to the absurd value asked by them, which could get as high as 20 million gold. Ultimately, these bugs, just like the bleeding floor, are examples of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's many entertaining and largely issues.

  The GameCube was an innovative lunge towards creativity, and it showed this even in its appearance. The console was released by Nintendo in 2001 and stands as an iconic chapter in the history of console gaming. The console departed from its predecessors in terms of technological advancements and design and offered up a small yet exceptional library of games for video game lovers to enjoy.

 <p>
  Over the years, the console's library expanded further, and the community still appreciates it even today. Collectors and gamers alike are often willing to pay a hefty amount of money to get some of these games, as there are titles that sell for as much as four thousand dollars. With so many titles left unattended for many a year, the most expensive GameCube games are now starting to garner the kind of attention they really deserve.

   <em>
    Updated November 16, 2024 by David Heath:
   </em>
  </strong>
  It's a rough time to get into retro games collection, as even some common games from back in the day are now going for high prices.
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  fans can still find the PS2 version of
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  for cheap if they're not picky on condition or extras. But if they want
  <em>
   MGS: The Twin Snakes
  </em>
  , the Gamecube remake of
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  , they're going to have to shell out roughly $96 for it in a box. $5 less if they just want the disc.

 <p>
  Even so, that's a drop in the bucket compared to the Gamecube's rarest games, which are only getting rarer with each year. Some are tempting enough to pop out of their packaging, but others are worth keeping in as pristine condition as possible. That's why this list has been updated with a few more rarities for the Gamecube, including some territory-specific gems, and updated prices for all the old entries, as yesterday's treasure can become today's tin, and vice versa.

    Gotcha Force
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a third-person shooter game that is known for its unique gameplay, which focuses on collecting and using various toy robots called Gotcha Borgs. In the game, players will have battles against numerous computer-controlled robots where they will have to use the unique skills and abilities of their selected robots.

  The game has many Gotcha Borgs to collect and fight with, each one having its own stats and moves, and collecting a good team is the key to overcoming the enemy in battles.

   Gotcha Force
  </em>
  was loved for its unique robot battles and still holds its value as one of the most expensive GameCube games. Well, in North America anyway. Japanese copies are relatively cheap at $60 loose, and PAL copies are double that at $120.

  Some classic arcade games had trouble fitting in as games got bigger. Score attack games like
  <em>
   Breakout
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Frogger
  </em>
  have their place in gaming history, but couldn't compare to wide-spanning adventure games like
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  . That's not to say they didn't try.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Frogger Beyond
   </em>
  </strong>
  gave the frog a story about proving himself to a council of elders — mostly by hopping past obstacles from one end of the level to the other like in the classic game. Just with 3D graphics, power-ups, and a variety of settings.

  It wasn't anything special, and its NTSC prices reflect that. Its PAL copy is even cheaper as a loose disc. But Europe must be full of loose
  <em>
   Frogger Beyond
  </em>
  discs, as it's much harder to find this game in its box. CIB copies have risen in cost to $450 and are climbing, and new copies have climbed even higher. They went from being $217 in late 2021 to being $1,260 now. That price has stayed steady since August 2024, but is unlikely to drop, as it's been on a consistent upward trend.

  One of the ways a game can rise in value is by flopping on release. It's not great for the developers, but neat for collectors. It worked out for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cubivore
   </em>
  </strong>
  at any rate, where players fought their way through the dwindling wilderness in order to grow strong enough to take out the Killer Cubivore and restore the natural balance. It was meant to game-ify nature, as the cubivores can mutate into one of 5 forms, from defensive Yellowbrates to fast-running Greyodons, and mate with others to produce more evolved variants.

  It received above-average reviews for its unusual gameplay and cubey graphics, which didn't result in large sales. However, its cult-classic status and rarity led its prices to surge. The CIB game is now worth over 7 times its cost from 2014, going from $65 to $462. It's easier to get it that way than brand new, as prices for pristine copies are prone to wild spikes. For now, it's steadily risen to $684, but it has spiked to being worth just under $2,000 a few times in the past.

  Thankfully, the days of the NTSC/PAL frame rate difference issues are mostly over. Europeans don't have to struggle with
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  feeling sluggish, and Americans can play
  <em>
   The Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune
  </em>
  without it feeling too fast. Still, these regions can still have exclusive offers in the form of special packs. Different stores in different countries were able to bundle two or more games together in one pack to appeal to new customers. It was more fussy than just having a 'buy-one-get-one-free' deal, but it produced some rare items.

  For example,
  <em>
   <strong>
    A Star Wars Experience Action Pack
   </strong>
  </em>
  combined
  <em>
   Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader
  </em>
  with
  <em>
   Star Wars: The Clone Wars
  </em>
  , and was exclusive to Europe.
  <em>
   Rogue Leader
  </em>
  was a fun arcade shooter,
  <em>
   The Clone Wars
  </em>
  less so, which might be why the Action Pack received a 'Volume 2' that replaced it with
  <em>
   Star Wars: Bounty Hunter
  </em>
  . Both are expensive, with PriceCharting listing CIB copies of Volume 1 at $504, and Retroplay offering Volume 2 for €1,199 ($1,264).

  <strong>
   <em>
    Go Go Hypergrind
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a cartoony skateboarding game released exclusively in North America, despite being designed by Japanese developers Team Poponchi via Atlus Japan. The character designs were by Spumco, the
  <em>
   Ren &amp; Stimpy
  </em>
  creators, where their wacky cartoon figures take each other on in skateboarding trials for a spot in a boarding-based cartoon. Aside from the addition of cartoon violence and slapstick, it was essentially an easier
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Being region-exclusive and one of Spumco's non-
  <em>
   Ren &amp; Stimpy
  </em>
  -related projects before their closure in 2005, it's risen in value over the years. In 2016, it was between $17-35, then started gradually climbing from there to $263 loose, $505 CIB, and $805 new. As more copies either get lost or bought up, those prices are only going to rise higher. So, if anyone has this game lurking in their collection, they might want to dust it off and fix it up.

  Remember when game stores had displays where people could try out games before they bought them? Maybe some places still have these setups, but dedicated displays have become a thing of the past. It's easier for game companies to plonk demos onto their digital storefronts, if at all, than to put them on discs for Gamestop or magazines these days. Though that also means they likely won't mind if these formerly 'Not for Retail' discs ended up on the market.

  The blandly-named
  <em>
   <strong>
    Interactive Multi-Game Demo Disc Version 16
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the most valuable of the Gamecube's demo discs, as it came with a few quirks. Players can use it to download a patch for
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire
  </em>
  that gives them a Shiny Zigzagoon with a Liechi Berry, and fixes a glitch in the game that stopped Berries from growing. Back in the day, gamers had to be in the right store at the right time to get the patch. Now they just need to cough up $239 for a loose disc, $525 for a complete box, or see if it can be emulated.

  Curiously, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Monkey Ball 2 Pack
   </em>
  </strong>
  's prices have been as erratic as the tricky ball-balancing gameplay. For most of the 2020s thus far, its loose copies were going for at least $99, and CIB prices reached their peak in June 2023 at $1,069. Now the loose prices are much more bearable at $14.99, and CIB prices have remained around half-price at $537. The prices for new copies are still astronomical, and there's still a chance all prices could spike across the board again.

  The pack offers the first two
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  games, which revolve around monkeys trapped in balls, which players must roll around various maps with intricate puzzles to solve within the time limit. It was particularly fun in multiplayer mode, as two players had to try and stay on course and reach the goal before their friend did. There are newer
  <em>
   Monkey Ball
  </em>
  games, yet surprisingly, the only way to play the original games (for now) is via the Gamecube versions. Best grab the pack loose while the price is still low.

  Fans know they're going to have to go big when the box for the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Adventure 2 Pak
   </em>
  </strong>
  alone goes for just over $435. This pack includes two classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2: Battle
  </em>
  . The first one is a remaster of the original
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  game, which touches up the graphics and adds Free Camera movement, but as a result, it ended up with some bad bugs the original Dreamcast game didn't have.

 <p>
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2: Battle
  </em>
  had a better transition to the Gamecube, and offers the same high-speed platforming, racing, and treasure-hunting gameplay the players are used to. Both it and
  <em>
   SA: DX
  </em>
  are the most commonly ported versions of the game, appearing on later consoles and PC, and even their original Dreamcast and Gamecube copies can be found for fair prices individually. But they were rarely put together as a bundle prior to Steam deals. As such, this North America-exclusive double pack is a rare gem, and just as pricey.

  Another NA-exclusive two-in-one pack that costs nearly $1,000 is the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metroid Prime &amp; Zelda: The Wind Waker Combo
   </em>
  </strong>
  . As the title suggests, it offers players two critically acclaimed Nintendo titles in one bundle:
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
  </em>
  . In
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  , players will get the classic
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  experience from a 3D first-person perspective. Considering it led to 2 sequels and a highly anticipated 4th game in the works, it was a successful move.

 <p>
  The other game in the pack,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,
  </em>
  was initially controversial for its unique art style, as fans were expecting something moodier, like the later release
  <em>
   Zelda: Twilight Princess
  </em>
  . But its bright cel-shading aged better over the years, and offered a new sea-faring adventure where Link works with his sister Tetra to stop Ganon. Separate NA
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  copies are getting more expensive, with loose copies going for $55, which is still much cheaper than this combo bundle.

  Tiny toy cars have been entertaining kids since the rise of motor vehicles. Some people might remember playing with Micro Machines or their video game equivalents. Japan's Choro-Q toy car line was relatively late to the party, with the lackluster
  <em>
   Penny Racers
  </em>
  on the N64, and the slightly better Gamecube/PS2 racer
  <em>
   Road Trip
  </em>
  , aka
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gadget Racers
   </em>
  </strong>
  in PAL territories. The NA version isn't so hard to find, and is much easier to afford across the board.

 <p>
  But it's the different title and lower frame rate that makes it worth a decent chunk of change. While the game didn't set the European charts alight, its rarity and connection to a long-running Japanese toy brand have seen it rise considerably in price. It spiked suddenly in 2021, then steadily rose over the years until toy fans would have to shell out $717 or so for a CIB copy. So, any Gamecube-owning racing fans in Europe might want to check if they have this game in their collections.

  Everyone knows
  <em>
   Pokémon
  </em>
  at this point. They may even know
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokémon Colosseum
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Gamecube follow-up to the Nintendo 64's
  <em>
   Pokémon Stadium
  </em>
  games. It had similar strategy-based combat, but threw in a storyline and action-RPG elements to offer the player more than constant battling. Players could even trade Pokémon from all 5 GBA games to
  <em>
   Colosseum
  </em>
  and vice versa via the link cable. Some versions come with the
  <em>
   Pokémon Box
  </em>
  , which is now ironically cheaper than getting the
  <em>
   Box
  </em>
  on its own.

 <p>
  The most valuable version of the game is the Pre-Order edition, as it came with a bonus disc that had trailers for the
  <em>
   Jirachi: Wish Master
  </em>
  movie, and let players add Jirachi to
  <em>
   Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire
  </em>
  . The bonus disc can be bought separately for over $200 loose, but if they want it with
  <em>
   Pokémon Colosseum
  </em>
  , they've got to shell out over triple that price at $714, and even more if they want it in-box.

  Developed by Konami,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Sports Basketball
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a part of the
  <em>
   Disney Sports
  </em>
  series, which featured various Disney characters doing sports of all kinds. In this case, players choose from Mickey Mouse and Goofy to Huey, Dewey and Louie, to put together their basketball team. The game was designed to be accessible and family-friendly, so everyone could have a friendly basketball match. In execution, it wasn't so great, getting poor reviews and a Metascore of 37.

 <p>
  For years, the game was practically worthless, since supplies were high and demand was low. But it started spiking in value in the late 2010s, to the point where players who picked up a CIB copy in 2014 for $30 can now sell it off for $1,150 in 2024. Provided it's still in good condition. If it's practically new, they can get just over $3,000 for it. It proves the old adage true: one man's trash is another man's treasure.

  Ever fancied the idea of spending $2,000 on a disc that lets players use their Gamecube as a hard drive for their Game Boy Advance? That's what the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokémon Box
   </em>
  </strong>
  does, as it acts as a literal storage box for Pokémon from
  <em>
   Pokémon Ruby &amp; Sapphire
  </em>
  . By hooking the GBA up to the console, players can store up to 1,500 of the critters on the disc. For players who did splurge on it back in the day, it offered some built-in challenges and rewards for using it, and a Pokédex offering stats, levels and other data for their stored Pokémon.

 <p>
  It's also one of the most expensive
  <em>
   Pokémon
  </em>
  games that money can buy, spiking in value across the 2010s and 2020s. Anyone who bought it new for $20 in 2010, and kept it wrapped and in pristine condition, can now get nearly 300x their investment in 2024 at $6,000+. Otherwise, they'll have to make do with $1,000-2,000 for Loose and CIB copies. If that's too dear for one's blood, the PAL version is only $70 loose, and Japanese ones are common as muck, being $30 loose and $75 new.

   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
  </strong>
  used to be pretty niche, starting off as a Japan-exclusive Nintendo 64 game before getting its more widespread Gamecube edition. Now it's a Nintendo mainstay, proving particularly popular with women for its focus on social interaction and exploration, and was even used in a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong via
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  . It led to it getting pulled from Chinese stores, though Chinese players can still find it and other games if they know where to look.

  Though it's American players who'll be due for a windfall if they have the game's Pioneer edition. They were made as prizes for a contest Nintendo held in 2002 where, if fans successfully explained within 50 words why they should be
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  'Pioneers', they would receive the game in advance of its official release, along with a calendar and an online chat with the localization team. It stands out from retail copies because it has 'for promotional use only' stamped on the disc. Beyond that, the content is the same, but its value is priceless.

  If getting the
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball 2 Pack
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2 Pak
  </em>
  sounded steep, they've got nothing on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic Heroes &amp; Super Monkey Ball Duo Pack
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It's just a bundle that puts together two iconic Sega games:
  <em>
   Sonic Heroes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  . The former splits Sonic and his friends into trios to use their individual Speed, Power and Flight abilities to tackle tricky 3D stages and face off against classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  villains. While
  <em>
   SMB
  </em>
  is the first game in the monkey-themed ball-rolling puzzle series.

  The Xbox had a similar compilation in the
  <em>
   2 in 1 Pack: Sonic Heroes and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe
  </em>
  , which at most goes for $99.95 new. So, why is the Gamecube edition sky-high? For one, the Gamecube had the best versions of both games, as the XBox ports had their hiccups (albeit less so than the PS2 versions). The
  <em>
   Duo Pack
  </em>
  is also rare, being exclusive to NA regions. That said, its price spikes are relatively recent. Anyone who felt silly buying the complete box for $115 in 2021, or for $500 new, will be laughing all the way to the bank now if they find a buyer.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dungeons &amp; Dragons
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a versatile game, with a comprehensive fantasy adventure framework that can sustain a lot of different types of games. Of course, with its robust spellcasting rules and classic sword and sorcery archetypes,
  <strong>
   high fantasy
  </strong>
  is generally the most appropriate flavor for a
  <em>
   D&amp;D

  campaign.

  Throughout the TTRPG's rich history, there have been numerous published settings released to inspire players in their own adventures. These settings come in a wide variety of tones and themes, but here are ten of

  <strong>
   The Radiant Citadel
  </strong>
  is the most recent new setting to grace the pages of
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  , introduced in a 2022 adventure anthology for Fifth Edition. The titular citadel is a massive crystalline landmass floating along the Ethereal Plane. It is inextricably linked to a variety of mystical realms throughout the Material Plane, each of which provides ample opportunity for danger and adventure.

 <p>
  Perhaps the biggest selling point for the Radiant Citadel and its associated realms is its diversity. The anthology draws inspiration from real-life cultures across the globe, making it a perfect choice for groups who want to break away from the ever-present European fantasy tropes that are pervasive in so many other
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  settings.

  High fantasy is usually marked by a lack of advanced technology, with characters relying on magic or Medieval-era agriculture and commerce to meet their needs.
  <strong>
   Eberron
  </strong>
  provides a unique twist on the Industrial era, mixing magic and technology in a way that allows
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  to advance in industry without losing its high fantasy trappings.

 <p>
  The people of Eberron use magic to fuel fantastical mechanisms like airships and trains. The existence of Dragonmarks, hereditary mystical blessings, adds a layer of social intrigue. Eberron is also famous for introducing the Warforged, mechanical people powered by magic who have become a mainstay in the tapestry of
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   Spelljammer
  </strong>
  is one of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's most bizarre settings, as it brings the conventional high fantasy adventures of the game into outer space. Adventurers in a Spelljammer campaign travel the Astral Sea in spacefaring ships known as Spelljammers, which range from conventional sailing ships to fantastical fish-shaped vessels.

 <p>
  Despite the space travel conceit, Spelljammer remains firmly rooted in magic and sorcery, as the name might suggest. Exotic alien creatures and mighty dragons await in the endless reaches of the Astral Sea, which takes the discovery and magic of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  to unimaginable new heights.

  While
  <strong>
   Theros
  </strong>
  made its
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  debut in 2020, it first appeared as the setting for a
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  set in 2013. This mystical realm is an ideal fit for
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  , as its heavy Greek myth inspirations give it a lot of versatility. The sourcebook includes rules for devotion to the gods themselves and gives players the chance to earn mystic boons and divine punishments alike.

 <p>
  While the official Theros setting lacks fantasy mainstays like elves and dwarves, there are more than enough fantastical creatures for players to try out, like the catlike leonine, as well as mythical staples like minotaurs, centaurs, and satyrs. Meddling gods and divine magic are very common tropes in many high fantasy stories, and Theros is one of the best
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  settings out there when it comes to gods.

  There are plenty of options for fans of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  to play as non-magic characters, but with the wide number of spells and wealth of spellcasting classes on offer, many players find spellcasting to be the place where
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons

  shines. The massive magic academy of
  <strong>
   Strixhaven
  </strong>
  provides the perfect setting to explore the depths of this TTRPG's magic system.

  Strixhaven is another import from
  <em>

  that serves as a school for aspiring spellcasters of all stripes to hone their craft. The school is split into five factions, giving players plenty of inspiration for variety in aesthetics and backstories, and with the menacing Oriq lurking in the background, there's ample conflict to furnish a whole magical campaign.

  Dragonlance contains numerous high fantasy hallmarks, like fallen knights, fabled artifacts, and, of course, dragons. The titular Dragonlances are mythical weapons that allow even non-magical warriors to slay the fabled fire-breathing creatures, and these are just some of the powerful sources of magic and power that await adventurers in Krynn.

  The world-spanning city of
  <strong>
   Ravnica
  </strong>
  , a realm of magic and intrigue, has been one of the most prominent settings in
  <em>
   Magic: the Gathering
  </em>
  since its debut in 2005. In 2018, Wizards of the Coast brought the setting to
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  , letting fans of both games pursue quests in this grand and chaotic city.

  Ravnica is defined by its ten warring guilds, each of which struggles for control of the city. Each guild uses different types of magic and is associated with different fantastical creatures. Dragons and demons prowl the streets of Ravnica, as do more unique creatures, like bioengineered frog monsters and shambling masses of fungus. The variety of the guilds gives players plenty of options for character builds and backstories, and despite the urban setting, Ravnica never abandons the high fantasy trappings of its game of origin.

  <em>
   Critical Role
  </em>
  is a franchise that needs no introduction. The massively famous actual-play campaign turned animated TV series has been credited with getting a majority of modern
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  fans into the game. This popularity is due to the charisma of the stream's seasoned cast of voice actors, as well as the incredible DM skills and worldbuilding of Matt Mercer, including his creation of a brand-new setting: the world of

  Wizards of the Coast gave fans a chance to follow in Mercer's footsteps with the release of the Wildemount campaign setting in 2020, following some unofficial guides published by third parties. This book gives players access to a wealth of lore from Mercer's home-grown world, letting them tell their own stories in the famous DM's realm of magic, mystery, and danger.

  While the world of the

  </strong>
  is not the first campaign setting
  <em>

  ever had, it's certainly the most ubiquitous, especially for modern fans. It's the official default setting for 5th Edition, and serves as the setting for the recent movie

   Honor Among Thieves

  movie, as well as the massively successful
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  Just about every high fantasy trope modern fans associate with
  <em>

  is present in the Forgotten Realms, making it the ideal setting for a traditional swords and sorcery adventure. Powerful dragons, menacing demons, and divine angels watch over a diverse cast of fantasy races, from elves to orcs to dwarves. What the Forgotten Realms lacks in outlandish, genre-defying twists, it more than makes up for in reliability and accessibility.

  <strong>
   Planescape
  </strong>
  is an ideal setting for groups who want to turn the fantastical elements of their campaigns up to 11. This setting revolves around Sigil, the legendary City of Doors, an extraplanar metropolis riddled with portals to the various otherworldly planes that make up
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's complex cosmology.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":11,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":11,"nbrPlacementsScanned":11,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":980} -->

 <p>
  Sigil, therefore, functions as a sort of melting pot for reality itself in
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  ; players can expect to rub elbows with angels, devils, and dragons alike, sometimes in the same bar. Planescape turns many commonly-held assumptions about morality and ethics on their heads, and due to the otherworldly nature of its inhabitants, campaigns and schemes can have implications that stretch on for centuries. For players who want to dive deep into the grandest and strangest things
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's realms have to offer, Planescape is the perfect fit.

      Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trainers quickly devised solo strategies for the Seven-Star Tera Raid against Torterra.
     </li>
     <li>
      Two popular strategies shared on social media featured Orthworm and Haunter as key Pokemon builds.
     </li>
     <li>
      The unique Orthworm build relied on Earth Eater to counter Torterra's Earth-based moves, while Haunter utilized Eviolite and specific moves for success.

  Shortly after
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  launched the Seven-Star Tera Raid battle against Torterra the Unrivaled, trainers crafted ways to solo it with ease.
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  players then shared their solo strategies for Torterra on social media and listed the builds of two Pokemon that proved the safest bets.

 <p>
  Known as the Continent Pokemon, Torterra first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Diamond and Pearl
  </em>
  as the fully-evolved form of Turtwig and Grotle. In the latest
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  Seven-Star Tera Raid, Torterra's Ground-type powers were amplified via its Tera type. Torterra the Unrivaled will regularly use Wood Hammer, Earthquake, Smack Down, and Earth Power to deal damage. Twice during the fight, Torterra will use Shell Smash to boost its offensive stats, and then quickly purify any negative stat changes that were incurred.

 <p>
  With the Torterra raids now underway,
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  players have developed methods for defeating it alone. On the r/PokemonScarletViolet subreddit, two strategies that featured Orthworm and Haunter made the rounds. For the Orthworm build, one strategy shared by Reddit user seldom_sk8 utilized its Earth Eater ability, which caused Torterra's Earthquake and Earth Power to heal rather than harm it. With two moves effectively negated, Orthworm's Steel-type characteristics also allow it to resist Grass and Rock-type damage from Wood Hammer and Smack Down. With a Metronome as its held item, and maximum effort values (EVs) in HP and defense, Orthworm was given the Tera-Ground type, along with the moves Iron Defense, Body Press, and Protect, with room for a filler move like Mud-Slap.

  An alternative strategy that used Haunter was also shared by a Redditor named GussX. Haunter was given the Eviolite held item, which boosts the defenses of Pokemon still capable of evolution. With the Levitate ability, Haunter could nullify Earth Power and Earthquake. However, Levitate could in turn be nullified by Torterra's Smack Down. Even with Smack Down canceling out Levitate,
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  players pointed out that the boss Pokemon's AI will not account for it, and use moves like Wood Hammer first instead. The Eviolite Haunter build used the moves Clear Smog to negate Shell Smash's offensive buffs, and Acid Spray to lower Torterra's special defense. With Nasty Plot to boost Haunter's special attack, its Giga Drain attack could do serious damage when Terastallized to the Grass-type. Like Orthworm, Haunter's EVs were focused on HP and defense.

  Although Torterra is the last Starter Pokemon before the ninth generation to be featured as a Tera Raid boss,
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  still have more powerful creatures to pull from for future Tera raids. Only time will tell what strategies players will develop in the future.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Snap
   </strong>
  </em>
  is bringing Deadpool's Diner back as part of its November 2024 update.
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  first introduced the controversial mode as a tie-in to the
  <em>
   Deadpool &amp; Wolverine
  </em>
  film which came out in July 2024. It offered a way for players to gain access to the Cassandra Nova card and other perks, but it also came at a very steep requirement during its debut.

  While many fans were upset at the controversial event, resourceful players still found a way to help each other complete Deadpool's Diner in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  . The community was able to create a communication guide that assisted other players who hadn't earned all the collectibles. Second Dinner also adjusted the costs and antes involved after the initial backlash, which led more members of the
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  community to complete the event. Now, it looks like fans will be happy to know that the aforementioned mode is coming back to the game, along with various bug fixes and improvements, as part of the November 2024 patch.

  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  has revealed the contents of the November 2024 update. At the top of the list is the return of Deadpool's Diner in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  , which will be available on November 21. This time, the unlockable cards are King Eitri and an exclusive Jane Foster Andrea Guardino Variant. While it was not clarified, fans are hoping that the mode has been fine-tuned to allow players to grab the rewards.

 <p>
  In addition, several updates regarding gameplay, visuals, card changes, and many bug fixes were included in the patch. Cards like Surtur, Malekith, and Valhalla have all received new descriptions for their effects. No card powers were actually changed, so players concerned about
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  's current Season Pass card, don't need to worry. Maximus has also received audio and VFX.

  Meanwhile, a few quality-of-life fixes have also been introduced with the new update. Fans who want to ensure they purchase the right cards for their

  With this update,
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  continues to enhance and build on its successful formula that has the community of players excited with more growth. Several bug fixes for both mobile and Steam were addressed, which should allow the game to run even more smoothly. It will be interesting to see what updates the developers will introduce in the near future.

  CARD AND LOCATION TEXT UPDATES
 </h3>
 <p>
  The final stage of our development process includes reviewing and improving card and location text before we lock the season. Usually, we do that a full month ahead of time, meaning that even an older version of the game won’t have outdated text for upcoming cards. However, for the Nine Realms season that handoff wasn’t implemented to our most recent patch–only this new one. For that reason, you may see a few instances of text changes, namely on the following cards and locations.

  To be clear: These updates are text only. No element of the function is changing.

      <title>PS Plus Will Need a Shot In The Arm With Its November 2024 Games</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  One of the most bittersweet aspects of the current games-on-demand trend is the revolving-door nature of the industry's biggest subscription platforms. Services like Xbox Game Pass and
  <strong>
   PS Plus
  </strong>
  get new games every month, but they also say goodbye to various titles on a regular basis. It's easy to get captivated by new games coming to PS Plus and similar services, but while players are looking forward to the newest arrivals, other titles are usually sneaking out the back door.
 </p>

 <p>
  This is exactly what's happening this month, as PlayStation Plus is losing a whopping 18 games. Sony's on-demand service has been closing the distance to Xbox Game Pass, which many still consider to have the superior library of games, while also reaching a wider audience thanks to its presence on PC. Both of these platforms, however, suffer from a somewhat fickle nature, as players are constantly learning about the departure of certain titles, some of which can be very time-consuming and therefore unable to complete on a tight deadline. Sony drops a dozen-and-a-half of its best games this month, and it needs to balance the scales with some heavy hitters.

 <p>
  World-famous crowd-pleasers like
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  are bowing out of PS Plus this month, alongside cult classic indies like
  <em>
   Blasphemous
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Superliminal
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   What Remains of Edith Finch
  </em>
  . Notably, a slew of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  games are being removed from the service as well. All of these farewells set November 2024 up to be one of the worst months in recent PS Plus history, so Sony ought to issue some meaningful replacements.

  How Sony Can Soften the Blow of November 2024's PS Plus Losses
 </h3>
 <p>
  The group of games leaving PS Plus this month is quite diverse, with entries representing a number of different genres, scopes, tones, and so on. As such, November's new PS Plus games ought to be similarly diverse: perhaps a new Square Enix game could come along to replace the many
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  titles leaving the service, or an ambitious story-driven title could fill the void left by
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . Some of the best games leaving this month are indies, so this sector of the industry deserves some representation as well. Some games that would be a good match for PS Plus this November include:

 <p>
  Of course, only time will tell what PS Plus will look like in the coming weeks, but it's arguably essential that Sony step things up. The PS Plus Essentials lineup this month is decent, but not a showstopper, and with Game Pass gaining ground with the likes of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , PS Plus will need to remain competitive. If it pairs these departures with some weak new arrivals, then PS Plus Extra and Premium may be seen as notably less valuable for the time being.

    <ul>
     <li>
      The Seeker build provides great support but lacks damage output and survivability.

      Ravager is a high-damage melee build that requires quick reflexes and comes online late.
     </li>

      The Scorpion build is a top DPS choice with extreme glassiness, high mobility, and fast skill rotations.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Throne and Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  features seven different weapons to create builds with. Some of these can be easy to master from the get-go. However, a few combinations make for some of the most
  <strong>
  </strong>
  complex and demanding builds in the game.

 <p>
  Weapons that see a higher rate of occurrence in harder builds appear to be the Dagger, Longbow, and the Staff. New players should run easier builds for the first time before changing things up for one of the builds listed here.

 <p>
  The Scout build makes use of both the Longbow and the Crossbow. This results in a build that is great at dealing out short bursts of high damage, but it comes with two fatal flaws. The first is that it suffers in both mobility and having escape options.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":972} -->

 <p>
  If things go south or players find themselves in a bad position, things will be over fast. The second issue is just how glassy the build is, with players having little to no wiggle room for error. Players that run this build will need to have a deep understanding of how to deal with whatever bad situations may befall it.

 <p>
  The Ranger suffers from the same issues as the Scout, but not to the same extent. While this build can also be pretty glassy, the introduction of the Greatsword allows it to take more of a beating.
 </p>

 <p>
  It also lets players make a last-ditch effort to destroy whatever tries to close the gap on them. Players are able to deal great damage at any range, but will only be able to charge into combat, not get out of it. It is best to use crowd control, play defensively when in melee, and deal out short bursts of damage at range to keep moving.

  Some builds are easy to play and hard to master. This is not the case for the Spellblade, which is hard to play and even harder to master. Players may struggle just to try to learn how to play the build, and this can be very demotivating. It does offer a lot of mobility and damage output that can make it shine as a Dagger build choice.

 <p>
  Players will need to manage their resources, as this is a build that will have players burning through their mana to attack and reposition constantly, and without a Longbow, will not have much self-sustainability to pull it off when played recklessly.

  One of the best support options in the entire game is the Seeker. This is due to it using the two best weapons for players looking to play a healer. To make it the best Support option, it had to take a severe hit to damage output.

 <p>
  Players will need to play to match whatever their allies are doing, which means needing a very flexible and adaptive mindset. The build also has abysmal defense and is easy to take out. Players who want a support that is easy to run and tanky would be much better off with a Crusader.

 <p>
  Another build that makes use of the Longbow is the Liberator, this time paired with Staff. Again, players using a Longbow will be able to deal out high amounts of damage in a short amount of time. However, this build is very stationary, meaning it will just be standing there, wide open to attacks that it has little to no way of defending against.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Players will need strong allies that can protect it, especially since this build is just as glassy as earlier Longbow builds. Players will need to know where to go and what to do with any downtime or hesitation costing them damage output. This is a solid build to go with when it comes to large-scale PvP matches such as Castle Siege.

  Ravagers may very well be the highest damage-dealing melee builds in the game. They can dive into combat to deal massive amounts of burst damage and crowd control but also have the option to escape the moment their burst damage window closes.

 <p>
  This build requires players to know when to engage, and when to disengage and does not give a lot of time to make decisions. Players will need to train themselves to react at a moment's notice to use a Ravager effectively. Players will also not have effective use of this build until most of their gear is purple, and this can make leveling this build a rather daunting ordeal.

 <p>
  The Scorpion is one of the best DPS builds in
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  . This build will see players dealing out insane damage numbers, being highly mobile, and always having the means to escape against enemies. Players will be dipping and diving between ranged and melee combat while avoiding any damage.

 <p>
  This massive amount of mobility can make it a very survivable class despite being extremely glassy. Players will also have to learn to activate skills multiple times in a single rotation thanks to this build's low cooldown times, and failure to learn these complex rotations and when to alternate from escaping can tank damage output.

  During the first act of the game, the players have Source Collars equipped, restrictive necklaces that cannot be taken off normally. These source collars stop players from using the source and don't let them equip other necklaces. Removing them can take a little while, but it's an important step to ensure smooth sailing in future acts.

  Source Collars are powerful shackles used by the Divine Order to keep Godwoken in check. When equipped, these source collars stop the player from using the source, the world energy of Rivellon. Using source attracts voidwoken through the veil, which is partially why the Golden Order hunts and shackles any potential users of the energy as soon as they find them.

 <p>
  Source users also have the potential to be Godwoken, champions of their race's respective gods that can attain divinity to seal off the veil and prevent incursions from the voidwoken into their world. Lucian, the head of the Golden Order, wants to attain divinity, which is why he targets all potential Godwoken to reduce his competition.

 <p>
  There are three different methods of removing the source collar in DOS 2. These methods come into play at different points in time, though players will find it difficult to use source even after unlocking the source collars due to a lack of source in the starting region.

    Leya:

   Found in the Sanctuary of Amadia (X: 428 | Y: 20), Leya can remove the entire party's source collars in the right circumstances.

     If the player completes the quest "Most Dangerous When Cornered" and brings back Gareth safe and sound, she will remove your party's collars.

     Alternatively, if players have Lohse, she can soothe Leya, giving her the piece of mind to remove the collars.

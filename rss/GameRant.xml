  The Executioner is a solid assault mech, and one that is notable for its agility and high mobility. Equipped with special Myomer Accelerator Signal Circuitry, and despite its 95-ton weight, the Executioner can use its jump jets to gain a better tactical position on the battlefield, something that few assault mechs have the agility to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mech comes equipped with some impressively heavy armor, and plenty of weapon hardpoints which enable players to build custom loadouts for any situation. Because of its versatility, the Executioner can work well in both defensive and offensive roles.

  The Gargoyle is an assault mech that, due to its lower weight, is extremely mobile. This makes it a good choice for players that like to play tactically, finding ways to flank opponents and exploit weaknesses in the enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has good heat management, and this means it can be equipped with a range of energy-based weapons, which can be used to sustain fire on the enemy. Overall, this is a very balanced mech, with a good mix of speed, armor and firepower, which can be used to fit many roles.

  The Warhawk is an assault mech that is renowned for its capabilities in long-range combat. It is far from the most agile mech, but the idea is to stay at range, taking on a sniper-like role. It comes equipped with a Particle Projector Cannon (PPC), and can dish out a high level of sustained damage at range using this weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The heat dissipation systems built into the Warhawk are excellent, meaning much less downtime waiting for overheating to dissipate. As long-range mechs go, the Warhawk is hard to beat, it is a solid combatant and has a place in most mech teams.

  The Mad Dog mech specializes in delivering high levels of damage at range using missiles. It can be equipped with both Short Range Missiles (SRM) and Long Range Missiles (LRM), to suit each mission as needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result is a mech that can provide either long-range or short-range fire support, but also a mech that needs to stay out of harm's way as much as it can, as it has much lighter defenses than many other mechs. However, in the right hand, the level of damage this mech can dish out means it has a place in pretty much any team composition.

  The Nova is a mech that specializes in being equipped with energy and laser weapons, and as such, is very good at laying down lots of damage in a short time, but with some limitations when it comes to overheating and sustained fire. In short, it has amazing alpha damage, but needs to regularly allow its weapons to cool down.
 </p>
 <p>
  With its decent mobility and fairly low weight, the best way to play this mech is to use hit and run tactics. Dump as much damage as possible until the weapons begin to overheat, then back off and look for another weakness to exploit while the weapons are cooling down.

  The Stormcrow is a mech that is greater than the sum of its parts. On paper, it looks pretty lacklustre, but this is far from the truth. The fact that this mech can fit a combination of energy, missile, and ballistic weapons means that it can be used to cover almost every role a mech team might need filled.
 </p>
 <p>
  The result is a mech that is incredibly versatile. Many players prefer using the Stormcrow for this reason, and will specialize on it. It has decent armor and pretty good mobility, and can be used tactically with east.

  Anyone who has been a fan of the
  <em>
   Mechwarrior
  </em>
  franchise will already know what a great mech the Timber Wolf is. This is one of the most iconic mechs in
  <em>
   Mechwarrior
  </em>
  games, first making an appearance as the Mad Cat in
  <em>
   Mechwarrior 2
  </em>
  . Most players agree this is one of the best mechs that have been available in the franchise for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes the Timber Wolf such a great mech, is the fact it can be fitted for up close and personal close quarters combat, or long range missile bombardment. This means that the Timber Wolf can fill any role in a team.

 <p>
  Taking top spot on this list is the Dire Wolf. Don’t let the fact that it weighs in at a whopping 100 tons fool you, as this is a mech that doesn’t rely on speed and agility. Instead, it uses overwhelming firepower and incredible survivability to dominate the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only downside of the Dire Wolf, is that a player needs to think about their position on the battlefield. If this mech gets surrounded by enemies, it doesn’t have enough speed to escape. However, its sheer destructive ability means it is a worthy addition to any mech team.

 <p>
  Pokemon come in all shapes and sizes, but to represent their prestigious reputation, Legendary Pokemon should always have much more eye-catching designs compared to the regular pocket monsters that Trainers will come across throughout their adventures. From blade-wielding wolves to otherworldly dragons, Legendary Pokemon have taken many different forms over the years, and while they are all very recognizable, there's only a select few whose appearances have truly been regarded as iconic among fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a design to stand out, it has to be unlike anything else seen within the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  universe. After all, this is a world packed full of wacky, unique and creative creatures, so doing something different isn't always easy, but for a Legendary Pokemon to get across its strength and superiority, a breathtaking design is necessary. When push comes to shove though, these are the Legendaries with the best designs based on their creativity, memorability, and overall flare as a Pokemon.

  If there's one word that can sum up Entei's design, it would be intense. As a Pokemon based on a lion who always has a fiery look in its eyes and a stern look on its face, Entei looks like it's ready to partake in an intense battle at any moment. At the same time, though, Entei has been made to look quite a bit older than many of the other Legendary Pokemon, ensuring that Trainers understand this is a Pokemon who has seen more than its fair share of intense battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The red, gold, and gray mask that Entei wears is also a very notable part of the Pokemon's design, adding a nice traditional touch to its appearance, along with the giant spikes stretching out from its back, which suit its very demanding presence and aura. Adding some more extra details that emphasize Entei's fire-powers would have been the cherry on top, but nonetheless, the Pokemon's appearance is a marvel to gaze at.

 <p>
  For a Pokemon to be classed as Legendary, they need to possess an immense amount of underlying power, enough to completely outclass the regular Pokemon who scour the land. In the case of Yveltal, this Pokemon can absorb the lives of living creatures just by activating its wings. Needless to say, this is a terrifying prospect, and the Pokemon's design essentially acts as a visual representation of these dark and haunting abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moody aesthetic that comes from the red and black color palette, paired with Yveltal's giant wings and claws, make for a pretty unnerving sight to behold. This design is also full of smaller details which help to elevate it even more, including the bright glowing eyes, and of course, the massive tail, which is fitted with a deadly row of claws. Though Game Freak could have potentially gone even further with Yveltal's edgy design, they still did a commendable job at showing what this Pokemon is all about just from the appearance alone.

  While all the Regi Pokemon have their own unique mech-like designs, Regigigas stands at the top of the pack with undoubtedly the most jawdropping of them all. One way this giant behemoth's design stands out is the use of colors, with the mixture of reds, blues and yellows all creating a visually bright and vibrant aesthetic that makes the giant instantly recognizable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another welcome added touch is the small tufts of grass attached to its head and feet, making it look like this powerful monster has just stumbled out of a forest after being shut down for a few years. Not having an actual face also contributes to Regigigas' design by presenting it as a soulless battle machine who has no emotions to spare. It would have been nice to see even more references to the previous Regis to present Regigigas as a kind of culmination of them all, but this is nonetheless still an excellent design.

 <p>
  Mewtwo's intimidating design perfectly encapsulates just how immensely strong this Legendary is supposed to be. One of the most notable aspects of the design which feeds into this is Mewtwo's eyes, which can always be seen glaring at the opponent as a way to demonstrate its superiority over anyone who dares stand up to it. There's also the massive tail that always follows it from behind, ensuring that he's always protected from anyone who tries to ambush it, which only adds to his unnerving presence and aura.
 </p>
 <p>
  This iconic design also reflects Mewtwo's tragic history, where it was created as a science experiment by using the genes of the original Mew. This resulted in the Pokemon taking on an alien-like body while still retaining the same head shape and tail as Mew, making for a rather unusual but also intriguing appearance for one of the most well-known Legendary Pokemon in the franchise.

  Even from a glance, players will be able to understand just how powerful the ferocious beast known as Groudon truly is, and why it deserves to be called a Legendary Pokemon. It should come as no surprise that Groudon is one of the heaviest Pokemon of them all, considering this monster is massive, and with the long white claws and razor-sharp tail, it's fair to say this monster makes quite the impression when players meet it for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Groudon can usually be seen hunching over where it can look down at its foes with its razor-sharp teeth fully exposed, but when it stands upright, this titan is an absolute joy to watch in action. Game Freak didn't go too crazy with extra details and colors for Groudon's design, but they didn't need to, as it still stands as one of the most iconic and memorable in the franchise.

  While there are plenty of Pokemon who are capable of taking to the skies, Rayquaza is undoubtedly one of the best, not only in terms of strength, but also design. With a long snake-like green body which has been decorated with an assortment of symbols and markings, Rayquaza looks truly epic when it's able to extend its full body to show just how massive it is, measuring at 23 feet overall. Having the small splashes of yellow and red inserted into its design also helps to make the design that much more eye-catching, providing an elegant contrast to the bright green that the Pokemon is known for.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rayquaza's face also deserves a mention here, and more specifically, how much it adds to its otherworldly aesthetic. The permanent scowl provides an eerie reminder of just how superior this beast always appears over its foes, especially those who dare to invade its airspace. There are many reasons why so many Pokemon fans look back fondly on Rayquaza, but its stunning design is a big one.

What also amplifies the look is the glistening crown on Zacian's head, giving the impression that it's some kind of king who's been summoned from his throne room to do battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, it's hard to talk about Zacian's flashy design without also mentioning the giant golden blade that it can always be seen carrying in its mouth. On paper, a wolf lugging around a sword in its mouth might sound a bit silly, but in this case, it works perfectly thanks to Zacian's knightly aesthetic, making its design a real feast for the eyes and one of the most creative in the modern era of the franchise.

  As a violent member of the Creation Trio who was banished to the Distortion World, it makes sense Giratina would have a rather devilish appearance, but this design is a thing of beauty. With golden crests surrounding its neck and head, giant black wings, and a massive frame covered in red markings, Giratina is a Pokemon who demands the Trainers' attention any time it manages to show up in the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Giratina also has its Origin Form, which sees its wings multiply into long tentacles, alongside its legs disappearing so that it can have an easier time flying around. Just like with the basic form, Giratina gives off a truly menacing vibe due to the darkness surrounding its body and the frightening glare that always beams down onto its enemies. Imposing, memorable, eye-catching, Giratina's incredible design ticks all the boxes, and is one which is always a marvel to look at when this fearsome Pokemon gets the chance to enter the battlefield.

  Early on in the campaign, players will have to
  <strong>
   rescue
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Nona
  </strong>
  from a pack of
  <strong>
   Balahara,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Y'sai
  </strong>
  from a
  <strong>
   Chatacabra
  </strong>
  . Once they have, they will ask to be escorted back to their village in
  <strong>
   the Windward Plains,
  </strong>
  named
  <strong>
   Kunafa, Windsong Village
  </strong>
  . It is here where players will first interact with
  <strong>
   Zatoh
  </strong>
  , who is the leader and protector of this village. He will be quick to dismiss you at first upon arriving at the main entrance, leaving you to return to the rest of your adventure before getting to explore his village later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  When continuing the main story and exploring the
  <strong>
   Scarlet Forest
  </strong>
  , you will be asked to return to the Windward Plains to assist the village of Kunafa in finding Zatoh. This will start the next quest in the story, called
  <strong>
   "Balahara of the Sandsea."
  </strong>
  Upon further investigation, Zatoh can be seen trying to escape another pack of Balaharas. Players will intervene and begin hunting one of the Balahara, with this being the first time this monster can be hunted in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  After being successfully saved, Zatoh has a lighter approach with the hunter and expresses his gratitude for their assistance. It is here that he invites you into his village, granting you access to all the amenities that can be used within, as well as another fast-travel point in the Windward Plains. While continuing to progress through the story from this point, Zatoh will help you as you journey to the
  <strong>
   Oilwell Basin
  </strong>
  . However, he will not stay for long as he will then be called back to Kunafa not long after you establish a base camp in this new location.
  <strong>
   From that point on, Zatoh can always be found in the village of Kunafa
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players complete the main story and enter high-rank, they can interact with Zatoh again to begin his side quest, "
  <strong>
   Beware the Gypceros."
  </strong>
  This mission requires players to successfully find and hunt a Gypceros, a winged wyvern that can only be found in the Windward Plains at high-rank while exploring the map. Once it is found and hunted, Zatoh will want to speak to you again, and will reward you with 3 Carbalite Ore, 1 Sharp Kunafa Cheese, and a good amount of progression in your hunter rank.

 <p>
  For those players on PC, it is good to know that keyboard support was fully thought out. This means that players on the PC can
  <strong>
   rebind all the keys
  </strong>
  that were originally placed by the developers. Allowing full customization gives the player the ability to do whatever they need to make the game feel more natural.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some changes players have recommended on the keyboard were changing how to dash, switching between NPC targets, and even changing how to mount monsters. While these are some small changes that the player can make, the overall changes that the player can make on the keyboard are much more advanced, making the
  <strong>
   keyboard option much more optimized and more flexible for those who enjoy the keyboard over the controller
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  However, one of the main reasons why players would not choose a keyboard for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is that it feels as if there is
  <strong>
   less interaction in combat
  </strong>
  and less feeling of a flow when fights happen, making the keyboard much more distancing for the player.

  The controller support for Monster Hunter Wilds allows players to change quite a few settings to fit their gameplay as they see fit. Some players have spoken about how the
  <strong>
   controller makes the game feel smoother
  </strong>
  and makes combat more relaxed. While the player can't change as many settings with the controller as with keyboard and mouse, the narrowed range of options makes the controller feel more how the developers intended the game to be played.

 <p>
  After looking over all the information, the best option for players playing
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is playing with a controller. While input device preference is ultimately up to the player, most players find
  <strong>
   more comfort in controllers versus keyboard and mouse
  </strong>
  , to the point that many PC players choose to play on a controller, rather than using keyboard and mouse. The game's
  <strong>
   Focus Mode
  </strong>
  does help bridge the comfort gap between controller and mouse/keyboard, but ultimately, the controller offers a more natural-feeling experience with the flow of combat.

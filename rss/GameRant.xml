  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Forest,
   </strong>
  </em>
  players will need to do everything they can in order to survive. From taking on deadly cannibals to keeping well-fed and hydrated, there are lots of things that the player will need to watch out for. Injuries are common on the island. Fortunately,
  <strong>
   aloe
  </strong>
  is a medicinal item that can be used to help the player recover from infection and sickness.

  Things can go bad fast in
  <em>
   The Forest,
  </em>
  so players will need to work quickly just to stay alive. Having a small stockpile of aloe can help the player to pull through what would otherwise be deadly situations. Here's how to get your hands on it.

  Finding aloe can be a bit challenging, especially if you don't know where to look. The first thing you should do is walk slowly through the forest. Aloe is pretty easy to miss, so be sure to take enough time to search the area.

 <p>
  Aloe can often be found in the
  <strong>
   Fertile Lands
  </strong>
  region on the eastern side of the island. It's easy to see as the area is lighter in color and less dense than some of the other areas of the island. Walk along the area and keep an eye out for
  <strong>
   dark green aloe vera plants.
  </strong>
  Aloe spawns in the same areas as other valuable plants such as marigold and coneflower.

 <p>
  Once you've harvested enough aloe,
  <strong>
   consider building a garden at your camp
  </strong>
  . By doing this, you'll always have a steady supply of aloe that can be harvested and used at a moment's notice. To grow aloe at your base, you'll need
  <strong>
   aloe seeds.
  </strong>
  You have a small chance to collect aloe seeds when picking aloe. These seeds can then be planted and grown to make enough aloe to see the player through the whole game.

  Aloe can be used alongside a few other plants to craft various medicines and energy mixtures. However, simply
  <strong>
   eating the leaves is enough to cure sickness and blood infections, while also satisfying some of your hunger.
  </strong>
  There are three core recipes that require aloe to make:

 <p>
  Health Mix gives the player 50 health points and provides the player with a small amount of nutrition. However, its main purpose is to heal the player. Health Mix+ is a more powerful medicinal item that heals up to 100 health points. Energy Mix, as the name suggests, gives players a boost to their stamina and their energy levels.

 <p>
  Players should try to keep a good mix of the items mentioned above on their character at all times. Cannibal and mutant attacks happen fairly regularly, players should try to be as prepared as possible. Keeping aid items in your backpack is a great way to give yourself an edge.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Avowed

  is shaping up to be another strong entry in Obsidian’s catalog, and the company’s history might help in the game’s success. When it comes to the game’s map,
  <em>
   Avowed

  might be best off taking inspiration from the planets of

  Ever since its announcement,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has drawn heavy comparisons to existing games. It’s confirmed to take place in the same world as the
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  franchise, so naturally, fans may expect a similar experience. Others were quick to point out that the fantasy setting brought up memories of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . Yet others have described the game as a fantasy version of Obsidian’s
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  , which might not be a bad route for the game to take. Based on what has been revealed about
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  ’s approach to map design, influence from
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  might help it succeed.

 <p>
  In a landscape where open world maps have become a standard, it can be difficult for games to challenge that design philosophy, but
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  seems to be following a different path. Much like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  ’s map strays from the norm, opting for something of an ‘open zone’ method. A similar method was used in Obsidian’s sci-fi, planet hopping game,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  . The idea is that there will be a large map for players to explore, but the map will be broken into different zones to be unlocked as the game’s story necessitates.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  , these zones took the form of different planets. Each planet was explorable and had its own lore, enemies, and quests, but players could only travel there once they reached a certain point in the story. It seems that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  might be using this idea in its fantasy world, where different zones include different story elements and different, self-contained areas to explore.

  The Outer Worlds' Map Layout Helped Structure RPG Content
 </h3>
 <p>
  This map design worked well in
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  because it helped solve a problem that many RPGs face. Developers can never be certain what players will do, so it can be difficult to corral them into certain places when the story needs them there. In a genre with plenty of side quests and enemies to take attention away from the narrative, it’s easy for players to focus on those elements of the game instead. The result is often that when players do return to the story, they are far overleveled, and the game becomes too easy.

 <p>
  The open zone system fixes that by giving players all the same freedom, just in several smaller areas at different points throughout the game, rather than all at once. Of course, there are drawbacks to
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's open zone map, such as limitations about what can be included in small spaces, but Obsidian has experience in walking that line.

 <p>
  What
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has in its favor is that, after
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  , Obsidian has experience designing this type of map. The fantasy setting may not fit it as naturally as a solar system’s worth of planets, but the experience of designing under these constraints in the past can only help Obsidian achieve better success the next time around.

  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  seems to be drawing from many of Obsidian’s past success stories. For example, the premise of

  has striking similarities to

  , another Obsidian game from 2016.
  <em>
   Tyranny

  also saw the player take on the role of a royal assistant who had been sent into danger on behalf of their ruler. Tying it all up by using the
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  world as a setting, Obsidian has placed itself perfectly in its comfort zone.

  Selling pelts and skins is how you can make money in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </em>
  </strong>
  —at least one of the key ways. There are various community-curated guides on money glitches, but they can be a hit or a miss. Fortunately, selling fur, hide, pelts, and skins is one of the steadfast methods that you can opt for, and it’s as easy as can be.

  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  is one of the most dynamic open-world games out there, and you’ll come across various animals and plants in it time and again. Killing and skinning them won’t take effort either, and you’ll be well-rewarded for your efforts. Once you have some pelts, skins, and other items, you can easily sell them at the various in-game stores.

  Selling all the animal and bird parts in

  —whether pelts, skins, fur, meat, or anything else—is rather easy.
  <strong>

  How Honor Changes Item Rates In Red Dead Redemption
 </h2>
 <p>
  Honor is an important mechanic, and it has a deep influence on every interaction in the game. So, before you travel to a town to sell off your pelts and skins in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   check how much Honor you have
  </strong>
  . This will play an important part in how much money you can get from your loot.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":907} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you have low Honor, selling items at Thieves’ Landing will fetch you more coins than at “civilized” towns like Armadillo and Black Water
  </strong>
  . Likewise, you will have to spend less when making a purchase. In case you’re on a low-Honor run in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , Thieves’ Landing is a crucial town for you. In that vein, the Bandana can be really helpful in protecting from Honor and Fame fall-off or rise.

 <p>
  <strong>
   All the shops in a town purchase or sell items at the same rate
  </strong>
  . As such, having high or low Honor will not matter across shopkeepers in the same town, and you won’t get an increased price even if you sell relevant items to particular stores—like feathers at the General Store or pelts at the Tailor.

  How Location Impacts Item Rates in Red Dead Redemption
 </h2>
 <p>
  Geography matters a lot when it comes to earning money in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  . The game is filled with various animals and plants, but their spawns are rather specific. Similar to the real world’s import-export mechanic, location is important when you want to turn a profit.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":994} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sell off items in towns that are far from where you got them. For example, if at neutral Honor, sell Grizzly Fur, Heart, Meat, etc., in Escalera and Chuparosa rather than Blackwater and Manzanita Post.
  </strong>
  This will net you double the money in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Follow this strategy for all the flora and fauna you come across to get a tidy sum every time. The amount may not seem much in the short run, but it can quickly stack up. This will also help you go after
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  's animals that are hard to kill but pay out much more, like Grizzlies and Cougars.

      <title>7 Atlus JRPGs With The Best Stories, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Atlus has existed for a long time. They used to be a small publisher who worked on games as well. They weren’t always the JRPG juggernaut that players see them as today. For example, they made a lot of platformers on the NES like
  <em>
   Rockin' Kats
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wacky Races
  </em>
  .

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":261} -->

 <p>
  Those games had very little in terms of story and NES games, even the bigger ones like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , lacked epic tales. As the industry went on, so did storytelling, and Atlus has both developed and published a lot of great narratives in its history. Let’s take a look at some of their best without diving into spoilers, ranked by how engaging the stories are and not paying too close to gameplay.

  <em>
   Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth
  </em>
  is the second game in the crossover series which was a spinoff of the
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey
  </em>
  franchise. For those unaware,
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey
  </em>
  was a throwback to old-school first-person dungeon crawler games that would give
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  fans a run for their money. The gameplay is similar in
  <em>
   Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth
  </em>
  except that it is easier for beginners to the genre.

  It combines characters from
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  . It’s not so much an excellent story as it is a great example of fan service. Players will love hanging out with all of their favorite characters even though the puns can get a bit heavy from characters like Teddy.

  is another crossover RPG but it’s one of the most unlikely. The

  If that wasn’t strange enough, the theme of the game revolves around pop stars and idols in Japan along with an evil organization trying to brainwash the nation through music. While dark at times, the offbeat story is so strange that fans of Atlus have to experience it to believe it and the connection to
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  is genuinely engaging. Maybe one day Nintendo and Atlus can collaborate again for a sequel.

  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 4
  </em>
  was the first mainline game in the franchise to launch on a portable system, the 3DS. Thanks to the system’s popularity, and the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series booming around this time, this entry got a lot of attention and it was an interesting place for newbies to start.

  Players began as a samurai-like guardian in a heavenly realm that was peaceful save for a few demons. After a few patrols, players are eventually cast out of their kingdom and down to Earth where it is revealed Japan has experienced a post-apocalypse. That’s just one of many twists that will keep players guessing as to what’s coming next from both Heaven and Earth.

  There have been a lot of games that use time travel in their plots like
  <em>
   Radiant Historia
  </em>
  . In this case, choices felt like they mattered more, making players feel the guilt of their weighty decisions. What starts off as one soldier trying to right his wrongs on a patrol gone bad, turns into a nationwide conspiracy theory.

  The hero, Stocke, is given a grimoire to travel back and forth through time which leads to some interesting puzzles to solve like how to ambush a strong set of enemies without dying time and time again. What’s going on with the world? Who are these grimoire-giving cherubs? There are so many questions that players may want a notebook to track their progress.

  , like a lot of Atlus games, takes a bit to get into. That’s why it was smart of them to release the entire prelude act as a demo for the world to enjoy. Toward the end, the basic gist is revealed. Louis, the game’s antagonist, killed the king in the present and cursed his son, the unnamed Prince, fifteen years ago.

  The boy still lives so players, as the protagonist Will in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , are sent to gather data on Louis to hopefully break the spell via assassination. Before that can go down, the king seemingly revives himself as a giant moon, declaring a democratic race for the throne which takes all parties on a journey throughout the land to gain the favor of the people. Again, that’s just the basic gist but it is a wild ride full of twists and turns that rival that of other crown-chasing projects like
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  .

  What’s cooler than a murder mystery in a game? Nothing. That’s why
  <em>

  long detective story that feels a bit like a Japanese version of Scooby-Doo.

 <p>
  Vanillaware, who Atlus has published many games for, has had some good stories over the years. However,
  <em>
   13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
  </em>
  feels like the culmination of their storytelling. Also, unlike their other games, the story is the sole focus of the experience, told through a light novel presentation but with exploration options in mind. Also, there are tactical turn-based mech battles but they are far and few between.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It’s also a time-traveling game and figuring out how all of these characters from different eras tie together is something no one will see coming. It may not be the best RPG in Vanillaware’s catalog, but it is certainly their best story and one Atlus should be proud of aiding the effort.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Invictus Could Double Down On a Mechanic Fall Guys Only Touched On</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Invictus
   </em>
  </strong>
  sits as one of the most mysterious upcoming entries in the long-running franchise, but recent leaks have shed possible light on what to expect. Although leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, new claims about
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  suggest that the game will be influenced by the platform battle royale title
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  .

  Based on these claims,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  will feature arcade-style mini-games that pit 16 players against one another until a sole survivor remains the one standing.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  ' rumored
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  influence is a surprising turn of events, and if proven true, could be divisive. Even if this approach to a multiplayer
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  title becomes controversial, there is one highlight to making such a bold change.
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  features its own type of rudimentary platforming and climbing. With this being
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's bread and butter, focusing on these mechanics in a multiplayer battle royale could be
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  ' strongest selling point.

  Focusing On Assassin's Creed's Strengths

 <p>
  Despite the rumored
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  inspiration for
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  being a head-scratcher, it could ultimately work if the game is used as an opportunity to highlight
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's best qualities in a completely new light. Although this isn't the franchise's first time with multiplayer, a unique multiplayer
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  project is something that many fans have been excited about, but some of the leaks hint at risky departures from the series. Further claims that
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  will also take inspiration from
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  by including bubble shields implies a more cartoonish approach.

 <p>
  If the claims of a less-serious tone are confirmed, this could face backlash. However, a good way to balance out such a controversial change could be to at least make the platforming and climbing mechanics just as strong as
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  ' more serious counterparts.
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  taking inspiration from multiplayer indie games runs the risk of not feeling like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  at all, but honoring its mechanics can keep the title from veering too far off course.

  Making Assassin's Creed's Platforming Even Stronger

 <p>
  One upside to these rumors is that, if platforming and climbing get their time in the spotlight, these mechanics will hopefully be refined to be even stronger. If
  <em>
   AC Invictus
  </em>
  wants to be successful, the game's controls and mechanics will need to be given the most attention compared to everything else. Even if the game's tone is more cartoonish than some players may want, having well-polished and tight controls would make drastic changes far more forgivable in the long run.

  Questions About AC Invictus Will Hopefully Be Answered Soon
 </h3>
 <p>
  There may be leaks trickling out about the multiplayer project, but
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  still remains a huge mystery. Rumors have claimed that Ubisoft has a big roster of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games in the pipeline. According to these reports, Ubisoft plans to release new
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games every six months for the next 10 years, showing the company moving toward a more aggressive approach to the franchise. With
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  being among these future releases, it raises questions about the quality of these upcoming projects.

  As more news comes to light, it will be interesting to see if the claims of
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  influencing
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  happen to be true or not. The
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise has become a massive series in the industry, but Ubisoft potentially going too bold with its future projects could run the risk of backfiring, or even worse, causing audience fatigue. However, if
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  manages to offer players a thrilling multiplayer platformer that showcases what
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  does best, then the alleged
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  inspiration could be a pleasant surprise.

      One Reddit user found a sealed copy of Final Fantasy 4 Advance at his local game store.

  A recent discovery at a local game store left one
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan awestruck as they stumbled upon a brand-new, sealed copy of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  <em>
   Advance
  </em>
  on its shelves. Though the game itself is fairly easy to find online, discovering an unopened game as popular as a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  title in a brick-and-mortar store would excite any prospective game collector.

 <p>
  The series
  <em>
  </em>
  may have started its life on the NES, but developer Square Enix later ported some of the earlier
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games to the Game Boy Advance with some new features and additional endgame content for fans to enjoy after finishing the main story. The system also had its own original entry in the series with
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  which took the series in a more tactical direction as opposed to the traditional active time battle mechanic the series was known for at the time.

 <p>
  The iconic status of the franchise and the immense praise for the Game Boy Advance ports of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  led Reddit user Salt-Entertainment91 to share their find of a sealed copy of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  on the official GBA subreddit. The user shared two images of the front and back of the game's case, which is sealed with protective plastic, implying that it is a brand-new, unopened copy, something incredibly rare for such high-profile games from older generations out in the wild.

 <p>
  In the comments, the fan confirmed that they purchased the game for about $100, which is much more than a loose cartridge of the game goes for on eBay, but the plastic seal makes it much more valuable. Others in the comments stated that if the user were to hold onto it long enough, its value could increase even more, given how rare unopened games from that era can be.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  has had multiple re-releases throughout the years, including a full 3D remake that was released on the Nintendo DS and Steam that included an epilogue tying up some of the story's loose ends. While this release was reviewed fairly well at launch, Square Enix unveiled their
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters
  </em>
  later, bringing the entire original series to modern hardware with updated visuals and mechanics.

 <p>
  In any case, the 2005 Game Boy Advance version of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  is a rare relic of a bygone era for the franchise, which looks much different nowadays with its focus on action combat and cinematic storytelling. While the most recent entry,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth,
  </em>
  retains some elements of the series' roots with its ATB mechanics,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  fully embraced complete action gameplay and focused heavily on cinematic spectacles over traditional JRPG combat.

  <em>
   Aura Craft
  </em>
  is a popular
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game that's not too dissimilar to
  <em>
   Infinite Craft
  </em>
  . To succeed, players will need to combine Auras in order to make new ones, with hundreds of potential combinations available as of the time of writing. It's not quite as content-rich as
  <em>
   Infinite Craft
  </em>
  in that respect, but it's still a lot of fun.

 <p>
  When players first get started, though, they'll only have a handful of Auras at their disposal, which can make getting some of the more complex ones fairly tricky. However, by understanding how to craft every Aura in
  <em>
   Aura Craft
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players can make their lives a whole lot easier.

   As of the latest update, there are 340 Auras in Aura Craft, and ours is the only guide online to contain information about every last one. This includes all of the craftable and uncraftable Auras, and every Legendary Aura that can be obtained through fusion. Further down the page, players can also find tips on how to farm the Coins needed to get rare Auras like Hax and Matrix as well as a link to a video guide showing how to climb the mountain and unlock the Challenge Aura.

  In addition to all of the
  <em>
   Aura Craft
  </em>
  auras listed above, players can get their hands on special legendary auras by fusing certain auras together. To do this, they'll need to make their way down to the lava cave beneath the starting area and then drag the two auras that they want to fuse onto the stone tiles. They'll then have to wait four hours (two, with VIP), after which, they'll have a chance of obtaining the legendary aura. The following table contains recipes for all of the legendary auras in
  <em>
   Aura Cract
  </em>
  , as well as the chance of successfully fusing them.

  Although most of the
  <em>
   Aura Craft
  </em>
  Auras can be acquired through crafting or fusion, there are some that players will need to purchase using coins or Robux. Thankfully, it's possible to farm Coins by repeatedly climbing the mountain and then leaving the server, although even then, getting enough Coins to get Hax will likely take some time. Then there are the two field Auras (Bat and Challenge), and Energy Balls, the latter of which will need to be gifted by the devs. One of the last Auras players will get their hands on is The Only, which is given as a reward for acquiring every other Aura in
  <em>
   Aura Craft
  </em>
  .

      Neva, a new platformer from Nomada Studio, focuses on the bond and growth between Alba and her wolf companion, similar to Ori and Sein.
     </li>
     <li>
      Like in Ori and the Blind Forest, Neva allows the player to improve combat skills and abilities as their bond with their companion grows stronger.
     </li>
     <li>
      While Neva and Ori share similarities in their gameplay and combat, Neva distinguishes itself by emphasizing the relationship and growing trust between Alba and her wolf.

  Platformers have developed beyond simple jumping and solving puzzles, regularly leaning into the potential of developing their art and combat systems.
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  is one of the platformers announced this summer that gamers have their eyes on, with its gorgeous art and canine wolf-like companion that develops in aesthetics and combat prowess as the game progresses.
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  's focus on the bond between a controllable player character and a companion that assists them is reminiscent of another popular title from the same genre,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ori and the Blind Forest
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  While the similarities between the two games seem obvious, with both
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  being platformers that involve saving beautiful worlds that are dying, they also both share mechanical and gameplay similarities in that they both include companions, and they both appear to involve a mechanic to improve their combat skills as the pair progress through the game.
  <em>
   Ori and the Will of the Wisps
  </em>
  expanding the original's combat is also comparable to how
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  is poised to build on the combat of its developer's previous game. Despite these similarities,
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  seems to have taken what is best about
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  and has made it its own.

  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  was developed by Nomada Studio, the same studio that developed
  <em>
   GRIS
  </em>
  . It follows Alba, a young woman who forms a bond with a wolf cub after they share a traumatic event together, as they set out to conquer the dark forces that are killing their beautiful world. The pair traverse the world together as they learn to trust one another and work together. The reveal trailer for
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  depicts the passing of time through the wolf companion's growth from a small cub into an adult.

  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  was developed by Moon Studios and released in 2015. It follows the player-controlled Ori and their companion, Sein, the light and eyes of the Forest's Spirit Tree. Both Ori and Sein deal damage in combat, and have different combat abilities that are developed as the player progresses through the game. Ori begins the game with no combat prowess but, by completing levels and learning the talents of other Spirits through Ancestral Trees, they develop their combat skills as well as other abilities.

  As is evident from the trailer and other information revealed, like in
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  , Alba and her wolf companion in
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  also share different combat abilities that are developed as the game progresses. As time passes in the trailer, both Alba and the wolf become more proficient in combat. While the details of
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  's combat are still unknown, it's possible that Alba and her wolf companion may be able to unlock combos and synergies as their bond becomes stronger and as the wolf becomes an adult and forms her own identity.

 <p>
  Despite the similarities, the fundamental concept behind the two games is likely to be very different, as
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  appears to have a greater emphasis on the coordination between Alba and her wolf companion than Ori and Sein. Ori and Sein had combination attacks and synergy, but much of the story of
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  is about the specific relationship and bond of trust between Alba and her wolf and how it develops. Improving their attacks and combat skills would be one way to depict their relationship improving and becoming closer.

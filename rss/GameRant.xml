  Fenris Wolf joins
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Snap
   </em>
  </strong>
  as a new Activate card with a unique Hela-esque ability. This card resurrects the highest-Power enemy card that's been discarded or destroyed. Fenris works against both the discard and destroy archetypes, and it’s not RNG-based, as it always brings back the highest-Power card. Because of this, it’s already gained popularity in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  ’s metagame, and players are crafting creative decks around this tech-heavy character.

  Despite its tech-oriented ability,
  <strong>
   Fenris Wolf fits perfectly in an aggressive Mill lineup alongside Yondu and Moon Knight
  </strong>
  . To build a similar deck, pair this trio (Fenris, Yondu, Moon Knight) with the following cards: Gladiator, Frigga, Scorn, Gambit, Swarm, Cannonball, Stature, Shang-Chi, and Proxima Midnight.

  Fenris Wolf Deck Synergies
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Gladiator, Cannonball, Yondu, Gambit, Shang-Chi, and Moon Knight are the primary activators for Fenris Wolf. Use them to destroy or discard enemy cards before resurrecting them with Fenris.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scorn, Stature, Swarm, and Proxima Midnight are discard beneficiaries. Discarding specific cards—either from your hand or the enemy’s—buffs or discounts these cards.
  </li>
  <li>
   Frigga is your joker card. You can use her to double one of your plays: either apply her to Fenris to resurrect two enemy cards or use her on a discard card like Yondu to wipe out more enemy cards.
  </li>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Don’t delay Fenris’s activation
   </strong>
   .
   <em>
    Marvel Snap
   </em>
   ’s Activated cards are often predictable, so it’s best to play Fenris as soon as you hit one of the opponent’s big cards. This will hopefully leave them with little time to counter.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Watch out for clog counter-strategies
   </strong>
   . Make sure Fenris’s lane has space for at least two other cards. You’ll summon one enemy card, and you’ll need another slot to add Power if the resurrected card doesn’t win the lane.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Save some discard or destroy options for late-game
   </strong>
   . This gives you a better chance to hit one of the enemy’s bigger cards.

 <p>
  Activate cards like Fenris Wolf don’t have direct counters like Cosmo. Right now, the only tech option to counter Fenris is Red Guardian, which can remove Fenris’s text. However, you don’t need to focus solely on targeting Fenris when playing against it. Instead, counter their strategy by including
  <strong>
   Shang-Chi, Shadow King, and Armor
  </strong>
  in your deck.

 <p>
  Fenris Wolf is one of the best tech cards to join
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  and stands out as a top-tier Activate character in the current metagame. Although discard and destroy aren’t as popular anymore, Fenris Wolf remains useful due to its aggressive playstyle. But it would have been an even better investment during the popularity of Hela discard META.

 <p>
  The challenge, however, is that there are many exciting cards coming to
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  in the next few weeks, particularly with the
  <em>
   Snap
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  crossover on the horizon. If it weren’t for these upcoming cards, Fenris Wolf would be an easy choice for any collection. For now, it’s best to hold onto your resources and save up keys and tokens for the new releases.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Jinx Fixes Everything
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a mini-game within the
  <strong>
   <em>
    League of Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  client that allows players to experience Jinx's point of view during moments that aren't directly seen in Season 2 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Arcane
   </strong>
  </em>
  . In Act 2 of the game, which relates to the corresponding part of the series, Jinx has just seen Vander for the first time since he was resurrected and unleashed by Singed.

 <p>
  By visiting The Last Drop, their old stomping ground, Jinx plans to use her resourcefulness to come up with a way to lure Vander to her. The plan is to
  <strong>
   fix the music box
  </strong>
  in order to play a song that Vander will remember. Players must have completed Act 1 before attempting Act 2 of
  <em>
   Jinx Fixes Everything
  </em>
  ​​​​.

    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  was one of the biggest games of 2023, with its popularity still maintaining a solid player base, and it wasn't just the gameplay and graphics that got it so much love. The characters were also incredibly memorable, with one of the most popular being Karlach, the Barbarian demon-slayer with a heart of gold.

 <p>
  Karlach has her own storyline and related quests to follow should the protagonist decide to pursue them, and she's also an Origin character, so the player can also experience her plot as the game's main protagonist. There are a variety of different builds that players can use to make Karlach even better, which is not easy because she already starts out as one of the game's best characters.

   <strong>
    Updated November 20, 2024, by Kristy Ambrose:
   </strong>
   Baldur's Gate 3 retains most of its fan base more than a year after its initial release, and that is partly due to how much love the game's characters have received from the fanbase. Karlach was one of many Companions, friends, and lovers from the player's adventures across the Sword Coast that made it such a memorable experience. According to the numbers on Steam, the player base remains consistent, and although sales have peaked, they still keep coming. For newcomers and experts looking to discover what the
   <strong>
    best build for Karlach
   </strong>
   is, this guide provides the answer.

  Karlach is one of
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3

  ’s origin characters, meaning the player has the option to play as her if desired. However, the player can also simply recruit her during the playthrough of the game. She can be found during Act 1 of the game. To find her, the player must head to the Risen Road, which is located after the Broken Bridge in the Blighted Village.

 <p>
  She’ll specifically be found in the forest at the end of the road. To recruit her, if the player has Wyll, they will have to talk him out of attacking her, as he believes she’s a devil serving Zariel, one of the rulers of the Nine Hells.

  Karlach is part of the Tiefling race, being a Zariel Tiefling, to be specific. Her class is the Barbarian, fitting her fiery nature well and also working well with her high strength. Her class also gives her saving throws in Strength as well as Constitution. The Barbarian class gives her access to Unarmored Defense and Rage from the start, which is extremely useful throughout the game.

 <p>
  Karlach also has the Outlander background, which gives her proficiencies in Athletics and Survival. She also possesses proficiencies in Perception and Intimidation, the latter being extremely useful in some dialogues.

 <p>
  When it comes to her starting statistics, Karlach's Strength is the highest ability score, followed by Constitution and Dexterity, which is the basic Barbarian blueprint.

   Level 1 of the Barbarian class will give her Unarmored Defense and Rage.

   At Level 2, Karlach will unlock Dark Sense, which will help her pass dexterity saving throws against traps, spells, and surfaces. She also gets Reckless Attack, which gives both her and her enemies Advantage on attack rolls.

  <li>
   Level 3 is where things get really interesting, as players will have to pick Karlach’s Barbarian subclass. The player has the option between Wildheart, Berserker, and Wild Magic.

     Wildheart allows Karlach to choose a Bestial heart, which is an interesting class subfeature and gives the player a lot to experiment with. Berserker, on the other hand, is more limited but possesses some powerful actions and class subfeatures, such as Frenzy and Mindless Rage. Wild Magic would allow Karlach to access Rage: Wild Magic, and later on, Bolstering Magic. The other two subclasses are powerful in their own regards; however, nothing comes close to the power the Berserker showcases.

   At Levels 4, 8, and 12, the player will pick Feats to help build the character.

   At Level 5, Karlach will unlock Extra Attack. She will also get Fast Movement, which increases the distance she can walk each turn by 3 meters.
  </li>
  <li>
   At Level 6, she will be able to use Mindless Rage as a subclass feature, making her Rage unaffected by charming, frightening, or calm emotions. She also receives an additional Rage charge at this level.

     Some good options for her when it comes to feats include
     <strong>
      Athlete
     </strong>
     , which increases her strength or dexterity, both very useful abilities to her. She will also make great use of
     <strong>
      Durable
     </strong>
     , as it will increase her constitution, which is essential for a frontline fighter. It also makes her regain all her HP after a short rest. One other feat that can be extremely useful is the
     <strong>
      Martial Adept

     , which would allow her to learn 2 maneuvers from the Battle Master subclass. Some of the best to learn include Disarming Attack, Goading Attack, and Sweeping Attack.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Monk:
   </strong>
   Karlach has decent Wisdom and Dexterity scores, so she would be a decent Monk, plus both classes use very little in the way of armor. She's great with weapons but hits hard with unarmed attacks thanks to her high Strength ability score.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Fighter:
   </strong>
   Give Karlach more options when it comes to gear by multiclassing her with a Fighter. Now, she can be an effective defender in addition to fighting in melee combat and use almost any weapon she finds.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Druid:
   </strong>
   For a more spellcasting-based Karlach build, she has a decent enough Wisdom and Constitution to be a healer or deal more spell-based damage. Many Druid spells are based on Nature or Lightning damage, which are useful for both ranged and melee fighting.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ranger:
   </strong>
   A versatile class that can fill almost any role, the Ranger gives Karlach some basic support spells and better armor and weapon options. A Barbarian-Ranger combination could be savage in melee range given the weapon options.

    Everburn Blade
   </span>
   : This blade can be acquired during the game’s prologue if the player chooses to fight against Commander Zhalk. Killing him won't be easy, but the reward is worth it. The uncommon greatsword deals 2d6 slashing damage with an extra 1d4 fire damage. This sword also grants Pommel Strike, Lacerate, and Cleave.

    Reason's Grasp
   </span>
   : These uncommon gloves will be very useful for Karlach, as they grant Ever Vigilant, which rewards the player for ending their Rage earlier with 15 extra temporary HP. They can be found very early on at the Risen Road, which makes them more worth it.

    Crusher's Ring
   </span>
   : This rare ring will increase Karlach’s movement speed by 3 meters, which will be extremely useful and allow her to cover a larger area. This ring will be found in the Goblin Camp and is worth looking for.

    Haste Helm

    Balduran's Giantslayer
   </span>
   : Perhaps the best endgame weapon for Karlach, this legendary greatsword offers 2d6 + 3 slashing damage, and it allows for double the damage when using the strength modifier of Karlach. It also grants an advantage against larger creatures when it comes to attack rolls. With it, Karlach will also have Pommel Strike, Lacerate, Cleave, as well as Topple the Big Folk.

  The
  <strong>
   PlayStation Portal
  </strong>
  has received a new system update that adds support for cloud streaming for select PS5 games, but the feature itself is still in beta. At launch, the PlayStation Portal allowed users to stream their PlayStation 5 games directly to the handheld device from anywhere in the world, as long as both devices had a stable internet connection. Now, thanks to the handheld device's latest update, fans can stream certain games straight to the Portal without the need for a PS5 console, but a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription is required.

  Unfortunately, Sony's latest handheld device doesn't allow users to play games natively like the good old days of the PlayStation Portable. But it didn't take long for engineers to hack the PlayStation Portal and play PSP games without the need for a PlayStation 5. Although Sony has since patched the hack, the Portal is about to become a whole lot more enticing thanks to a new system update that adds a highly requested cloud streaming feature.

  PlayStation Portal Update Adds Cloud Streaming
 </h2>
 <p>
  While the PlayStation Portal has been a financial success for Sony, a common critique of the device has been that it only allows users to stream directly from their PlayStation 5 console, instead of from the cloud. Now, thanks to a new system update on November 19 (users in Europe are set to receive the update on November 20), owners of the PlayStation Portal will be able to stream select PS5 games without the need for a console, according to a new PlayStation blog post. However, there is a catch. As these games come directly from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, users will need to be subscribed to the subscription service's Premium tier, which allows users to stream a plethora of games directly from PlayStation's servers.

  The PlayStation Portal has received various updates since its release, but the most recent one is sure to be its biggest yet. According to Sony, users will be able to stream over 120 PS5 games from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, including
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  , and many more. The new cloud streaming feature will support up to 1080p at 60 FPS with all of the usual DualSense controller features, such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, motion sensor, touchpad, and more.

 <p>
  For those who want to make use of PlayStation Plus Premium's cloud streaming on the PlayStation Portal, users will need a Wi-Fi connection with a minimum of 5Mbps upload and download speed, as well as a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. To access the beta feature, simply update the PlayStation Portal to the latest system software, open the "Quick Menu" and navigate to "Settings." From here, select the "Cloud Streaming (Beta)" option and turn the feature on. A new option will then appear on the home screen of the PlayStation Portal that allows the user to access games via cloud streaming.

      <title>Genshin Impact’s Xbox Release Follows One Unfortunate Trend</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  If there's one game that needs
  <strong>
  </strong>
  no introduction, it's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  . HoYoverse's free-to-play action RPG took the gaming world by storm when it made its debut in September 2020. Despite some mixed pre-release reception, it ended up generating a shocking $3.8 billion in revenue by the end of 2022, making it the most successful first year on the market for any game ever made. What made
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's launch even more impressive, though, was that it accomplished that when it wasn't playable on all platforms. When the game initially came out, it was only playable on PlayStation 4, iOS, Android, and Windows PCs, with no Xbox and Switch versions available.

  More than four years later,
  <em>
  </em>
  however,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is finally coming to Xbox consoles. During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, HoYoverse announced that the hit gacha game would make its way to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Game Pass on November 20, 2024. Considering that the Chinese developer had never released a game on a Microsoft console before, this was a pretty big deal.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  will likely attract a big audience on Xbox Series X/S, but its surprisingly large file size on the platform may discourage some people from downloading it. Games with high storage space requirements have become a pretty common occurrence on Xbox over the last few years, and
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is sadly continuing this trend.

  Genshin Impact's 100 GB Storage Space Requirement is Larger than Other HoYoverse Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  may be a free-to-play title, but it is filled to the brim with content. In fact, according to HowLongToBeat, it takes players around 676 hours to complete everything in the game, at least when playing solo. Taking this into account, it shouldn't come as a surprise that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has some fairly hefty storage space requirements. On mobile phones, the game can take up to 31 GB of space. Meanwhile, on PC, PlayStation, and now Xbox, it has a file size of more than 100 GB. Since
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is a constantly-evolving game, it's likely that its storage space requirements will become even higher in the future.

 <p>
  Other HoYoverse games have large file sizes as well, but compared to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , they're far smaller.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , for instance, takes up about 14 to 18 GB on iOS/Android, and 30+ GB on PC and PS5.
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , on the other hand, has a 55-57 GB storage space requirement on PC and PlayStation, but is only 20 GB on Android devices. The iOS version of the game is slightly larger than its Android counterpart, as it requires around 26 GB of space.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  are most likely smaller than
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  due to them being relatively new releases, but it doesn't change the fact that
  <em>
   GI
  </em>
  's file size is a hard pill to swallow.

  Several Recent Xbox Games Have Had Unusually High File Sizes
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's storage space requirement is
  <strong>
  </strong>
  really high on Xbox consoles, there are some other games that have even larger download sizes. The upcoming
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  has a 146 GB file size on Xbox Series X/S, while the recent Xbox port of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  requires more than 106 GB of storage. Additionally, there are a couple of titles that have bigger download sizes on Xbox consoles than any other platform. Take, for example, the recent
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Syndicate
  </em>
  60 FPS update. On Xbox Series X/S, it requires roughly 31.8 GB of space, but on PS5, it only has a size of 0.75 GB.

 <p>
  It's not exactly clear why some of these games have such high storage requirements on Xbox consoles, but regardless, they're likely to frustrate
  <strong>
  </strong>
  a lot of players on the platform. Approximately 50% of all current-gen Xbox owners in the US have a Series S. Since the Xbox Series S is an all-digital console and has limited internal storage compared to the Xbox Series X (at least in the case of its 512 GB launch model), downloading a 100 GB game like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be a hassle for most players on the system.

  One of the most pivotal missions in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  comes in as optional, and some players may never have seen it, or known how to properly complete it. Obtaining and completing the Chippin' In mission in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is vital to the secret ending, and it will also net them a few goodies on the way, like how to obtain Johnny’s car, gun, and jacket, all in one mission.

  Chippin' In in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is integral to the relationship between V and Johnny, so completing it and ticking all the boxes to ensure its maximum success should be every player’s priority once they reach Act Three. Listed below will be the specific dialogue that players must choose, as well as just how to complete Chippin' In.

  Once players have completed the Main Job Search and Destroy, they can begin Act Three of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  and talk to Johnny. Upon doing so, V will have a Relic attack and wake up in an abandoned hotel in Pacifica, thus starting the final part of the Tapeworm quest. Johnny and V will have a heart-to-heart, where Johnny offers V his old dog tags. Regardless of how players feel about Johnny, it’s important to select the following dialogue options to unlock the Chippin' In quest:

  By selecting these dialogue options, V will agree to allow Johnny control of their body just to speak to Rogue at the Afterlife, thus activating the quest chain for Chippin’ In. All players need to do now is head down the stairs into the Afterlife club, where Johnny will ask if V is ready, to which V needs to respond:

  Once V takes the pills and Johnny takes control, players are treated to an interactive cutscene of Johnny’s wild night out in Night City. There aren’t many things to note in this fun scene, and no decisions impact the quest or the future of Johnny and V’s relationship, so feel free to select anything, including what drink Johnny wants, what pill he wants to take, and if he’d rather give V a billy goat tattoo of “the other one” which is a love heart that reads “V + Johnny”. Upon the ending of this quest, Rogue will wake V up, and now all players must do is wait an entire 24 hours for Rogue to call.

  In order to speed up the process, players can head into their interactive menu, select the Skip Time option, and wait an entire 24 hours. After this, Rogue will call V and tell them to meet her in the afterlife. In doing so, she will reveal a gift in the trunk of her car, which is
  <strong>
   a replica of Johnny Silverhand’s Jacket
  </strong>
  . While it offers no bonuses, it is nice to claim a free piece of Johnny’s outfit to complete the look. From here, players just need to enter the passenger seat and enjoy the ride with Rogue as she drives to the Northside shipyard docks where they need to get to the Ebunike to find Adam Smasher.

  Once V and Rogue arrive at the docks, they are tasked with reaching the dataterm. Rogue might prefer to take the stealthy approach here since the docks are filled with Maelstrom. However, this has no consequence on the mission, and players can either shoot their way to the dataterm or sneak through. For better immersion, we decided to sneak for this part of the mission, utilizing data hacks to distract enemies, turn off cameras, and stealth to the dataterminal. Once at the dataterm, players need to access it and read through to Messages and then to Ebunike, which will then activate the next step of the quest.

  Regardless of whether players have been committed to stealth or full action, once players go up the stairs onto the Ebunike, they will be spotted and assaulted by Maelstrom and Jeremiah Grayson. Defeat all enemies and then talk to the wounded Grayson, where it’s a
  <strong>
   quest objective to claim Johnny Silverhand’s gun
  </strong>
  from him:
  <strong>
   the famed Malorian Arms 3516

  . Once claimed, players can interrogate Grayson for information about Adam Smasher, but it doesn’t go anywhere. From this point, players want to select the option:

  This will see V kill Grayson, and then from his corpse, they can

   loot an Old Access Card

  . While completely optional, players can use this Old Access Card to
  <strong>
   go down the stairs of the Ebunike where they killed Grayson climb a ladder to the left

      <title>Risk of Rain 2: Artifact of Rebirth Unlock Guide &amp; Explanation</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  With the addition of the Artifact of Rebirth, there are now 19 different Artifacts that you can find the codes for, unlock, and use in subsequent runs to add modifiers to your
  <em>
   <strong>
    Risk of Rain 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  playthroughs. A lot of the Artifacts in this game provide some pretty absurd benefits while also offering a bit of a trade-off as well, such as the Artifact of Enigma which starts you with an Equipment item, but it randomly rotates between Equipment with every use.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":456} -->

 <p>
  However, not all of them have downsides as anyone who has used the Artifact of Command can verify, and the Artifact of Rebirth is another one of these 'no downsides' options. That said, you aren't heading to Bulwark's Ambry to unlock this Artifact like all the rest, and the actual function of the Artifact of Rebirth can be a bit confusing, so let's go over exactly how it works and how to obtain it in
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2

  .

 <p>
  Before we go into how to unlock this Artifact, let's go over what exactly this Artifact does first. Essentially, the real 'effect' of this Artifact only really applies if you've previously sacrificed an item to the pool of Rebirth that appears after beating the False Son in the Prime Meridian (which, granted, isn't easy). If you do this,
  <strong>
   you'll start the run with the item you sacrificed to the pool as long as you have the Artifact of Rebirth enabled.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":375} -->
 <p>
  However, once you complete this run or die while attempting to complete it, the item in the Artifact of Rebirth will be lost as well. On subsequent runs with the Artifact enabled, it'll only give you a random common item at the start of the run. To put a new item into the Artifact of Rebirth, you'll need to beat the False Son again and offer another item to it.

 <p>
  And that's basically how the Artifact works. It allows you to start runs with any item of your choice, not excluding red items, which can be pretty game-breaking. However, there are some aspects of how the Artifact of Rebirth works that can be a bit confusing/unclear, such as:
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1015} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Sacrificing an item to the Artifact of Rebirth ends your run, just like if you obliterated at the Obelisk at a Moment, Fractured. However, if you interact with the pool once it'll spawn a green portal next to it. You can then use that portal to loop and continue the run if you want, though you won't get to put an item into the Artifact of Rebirth this way.
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone who was a part of the run where you put an item into the Artifact of Rebirth will also be given that item for free at the start of the next run with the Artifact enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
   Anyone who wasn't a part of the run where you put an item into the Artifact of Rebirth will be given a random common item at the start of the next run with the Artifact enabled, or the item they last put into the Artifact of Rebirth in their own run.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scrap and Captain's Defensive Microbots can't be put into the Artifact of Rebirth, for obvious reasons.

  Now let's get into how to actually unlock the Artifact of Rebirth overall, and thankfully it's a pretty simple process. Unlike just about every other Artifact in the game, you don't actually need to loop or use the computer in Sky Meadow or Helmith Hatchery to reach Bulwark's Ambry and go through that whole process.

 <p>
  Instead,
  <strong>
   to unlock the Artifact of Rebirth, you just need to make it to the False Son in Prime Meridian, beat him, and then put an item into the Artifact of Rebirth, thereby ending your run.

 <p>
  The difficulty you do this on and how long you take to get here don't matter, all that matters is beating the False Son and offering the item. For those who don't know how to reach the False Son, we've broken down the steps to do so below:

  <li>
   Either complete a Halycon Shrine when it appears (typically on Stage 1) and enter the Green Portal afterward or use Newt Altars and the Lunar Seer at the Bazaar Between time to get on any of the new stages (excluding Verdant Falls).
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete the two green portal Seekers of the Storm stages, those being Reformed Altar into Treeborn Colony.
  </li>
  <li>
   Take the Green Portal in Treeborn Colony into Prime Meridian.
  </li>
  <li>
   Climb up to the top of Prime Meridian and fight the False Son at the peak.

  There are so many objects in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
   </em>
  </strong>
  that can be used as weapons. From water guns to CDs, almost everything players pick up can be used to wipe out a crowd of zombies. The Willamette Park Mall is huge, and there are secrets around every corner.

 <p>
  Knowing where to go to find the best weapons isn't always obvious. Just because Frank West is in the midst of a zombie apocalypse doesn't always mean he can't have a bit of fun though, especially when there are plenty of excellent weapons that can be used from the beginning and throughout.

  Many makeshift weapons can be used early on to give players the upper hand when dispatching zombies, and the skateboard is an excellent choice because it also doubles as a mode of transport for getting around the mall.

  Frank can use the skateboard to ride into a crowd of zombies and take them out, although it can be riskier than other objects on wheels. When the urge to turn into Tony Hawk subsides, it can also be used to hit any zombies that get in the way.

  While the mannequin can be a solid choice for wiping out a gathering of the undead, the shelves are excellent for clearing out elevators or tight corridors. They are everywhere, with the easiest one to access right in front of Frank after leaving the vent above the Security Room.

  They don't have the best durability and are classed as heavy weapons, so they can't be stored in the inventory. Still, when approached by countless zombies, the shelves are an easy item to find when getting overwhelmed.

  The shopping trolley can be found everywhere, particularly in large crowds. Just listen for the squeaky wheels and they'll be close by. They can be swung in the air, but the best way to use them is as an indoor zombie plow.

  While items like the skateboard or the lawn mower can be used similarly, the shopping trolley is much faster and easier to control, and with decent durability, they're great for killing plenty of zombies in such a short time, as well as keeping them at a distance.

  A staple of
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  , the chainsaw is just as fantastic this time around. It might be slow, but Frank can run with it without having to press any buttons to clear the way and do damage to the masses of zombies scattered around Willamette Park Mall.

 <p>
  While not as compact as the small chainsaw, it does a lot of damage when swung in circles, making it great to escape a particularly tense situation. Running with it stops any zombies trying to eat Frank, making it a must for intense onslaughts of the undead.

  It might not be a melee or ranged weapon that can be repetitively used, but the queen is superb for causing any zombies in its vicinity to collapse on the spot. They are found by taking out zombies that act differently from the rest, normally staring into space.

  Once Frank has picked up the jar with the queen inside, it can then be thrown at a crowd of zombies and cause them to seize up and drop to the ground. A single-use item that has an instant impact, making it perfect for clearing paths for Frank and his survivors.

  The katana is one of the quickest weapons, capable of doing a lot of damage. It slices through enemies without any resistance and is the perfect weapon for dismembering zombies and psychopaths without ever breaking a sweat.

  There are seldom melee weapons as good as the katana, even though it doesn't have the longest lasting durability. Nothing is more satisfying than killing so effortlessly, especially when fighting bosses who like to get in close.

      <title>Satisfactory Dev Coffee Stain Talks How to Have a Great Early Access</title>

 <p>
  Among the list of Early Access success stories, few games have set the bar as high as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Satisfactory
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which entered its full release in September after five years of testing and refining the game in players’ hands.

 <p>
  Snutt, community manager for

  A Satisfying Early Access
 </h2>
 <p>
  For all the success stories like
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  , there are innumerable stories of Early Access games having rocky development or outright failing to deliver, which has earned the concept a mixed reputation. So how did Coffee Stain manage to navigate the controversial process so deftly that player support for the game has been high throughout? Snutt attributed it to things like setting clear expectations, a flexibility to take the game where the players are going, and a willingness to own the studio's mistakes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":714} -->

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I think the biggest thing is setting expectations. Because I think Early Access still is sort of undefined for a lot of people. When you hear that a game is in Early Access, you don't really know what that means–like, what the state of the game is. Is it going to be really buggy? I think there's a lot of different expectations that people have when they hear that a game is Early Access. So it's been really important for us to be sure to try and set expectations, temper what people want to see from a game that is in Early Access, and try to be as honest as possible.

 <p>
  He went on to say that Coffee Stain has approached the game with a willingness to admit where things haven’t worked, or if it has gone in the wrong direction. Because of how variable expectations on Early Access are, maintaining transparency and honesty, especially about its own faults, is critical to Coffee Stain’s strategy to keep its players’ trust through the process. That goes hand-in-hand with the other core part of its strategy–being flexible enough to take the game where the players want.

 <p>
  For instance, Snutt explained that
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  was initially envisioned to have a greater focus on combat, but when the game got into players’ hands, Coffee Stain realized that was less important to what people enjoyed about the game than it initially thought. Plans to introduce more creatures and combat mechanics got shelved so that the studio could focus more on things like traversal, efficiency, and cosmetics–things the players were clamoring for by comparison.

 <p>
  Another prime example of how Coffee Stain was responsive to the fans during Early Access comes in the form of the critter that arguably serves as the game’s mascot: the Lizard Doggo. As many players know, as designed, the Lizard Doggo was neither a lizard nor a doggo, but something closer to a shrimp bunny hybrid.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It's funny how with some things people in our community really pick up on it, and then we just decide to roll with it and fully go with it. Like the name Lizard Doggo is not something we came up with, that was someone in our community that coined the term, and then we were like, “oh, cool, that's a good term. Let's go with it. Let's roll with it.” YouTube commenter Chad Mojito coined the name. It's funny how little Shrimpy became a big icon for the game.

 <p>
  Having a positive community to foster those kinds of interactions can be a struggle for some developers, and Snutt is aware that part of getting the right kind of community is luck. That doesn’t mean that Coffee Stain hasn’t done things to foster that positivity, however. Beyond just luck and good moderation, Coffee Stain works to humanize the effort that goes into Satisfactory, to make the game more than a product in the eyes of its audience. That humanity goes both ways, as Snutt doesn’t treat players as purchasers, but also affords the same level of humanization. The developers and players get to know one another, and the game represents this collaborative vision.

  While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to a successful Early Access, to Snutt, the philosophy
  <em>

  has used throughout the process is the thing he’d recommend to other studios.

  What Does Early Access Mean?
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are a lot of reasons why games would enter Early Access. Notably, it can help bridge the resource gap between indie developers and AAA studios. Early Access can help both in the promotion and marketing of a game as well as a funding source for late development costs. It can be a very appealing option for games with initial funding from Kickstarter for that exact reason. Snutt cautioned against viewing an Early Access launch in those business-focused terms, however.

  <p>
   It's really important that you know what you're getting into because it might seem like, “Oh, if we just go into early access,we can maintain support for our game, and we can just keep working on it, and blah, blah.” There's many factors that play into whether or not a game will be successful in early access … If I have to give advice, I think you need to know that you can deliver on your promises. You have to be able to set expectations properly and be able to communicate, first and foremost. And you know, you don't have to set up roadmaps, anything like that, because we didn't. We had one roadmap at the beginning, but then we decided to not go with it, because we felt like we wanted more freedom and to be able to react more. Communication comes in many different forms.

  was a very different game five years ago, but it was a playable experience, which also was important to Coffee Stain, said Snutt. Players immediately got value from the title. From there, the way the studio collected and nimbly responded to feedback from its players helped it refine the experience in the way players sought out. This all laid the foundations for trust, which Snutt said is the most important currency between players and developers during Early Access.

  While the precise things
  <em>

  did during its Early Access may not apply to or be replicable by all studios, that philosophy of fostering and maintaining communication and trust can be, and it proved essential for

  And though Coffee Stain hasn’t decided what form its post-launch support for the game will take just yet, Snutt says it's not walking away from the project. Future updates will be more scrutinized before they’re pushed to players, but they will be coming down the conveyor belt, to be expertly sorted into over 6 million games.

  Zelda may be the leading protagonist of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but she hasn't been able to overshadow Link entirely due to one of the game's most powerful mechanics. Specifically,
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Swordfighter Form effectively brings Link into the picture, despite attempts by Grezzo and Nintendo to leave him out.

 <p>
  It's not necessarily a bad thing for
  <em>

  's Swordfighter Form to allow players to briefly play as "Link" in the game, but it does suggest something about the series' future.

  Nintendo Felt That Link's Sword 'Got in the Way' of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's Unique Gameplay
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ever since it was announced, the Grezzo and Nintendo's choice to feature Zelda as
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's main protagonist has been largely shrouded in mystery, aside from the point of view that suggests the role is long overdue for the titular princess. However, in an interview with Nintendo during "Ask the Developer Vol. 13, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Part 3," the developer stated, "We were initially thinking that Link would be the protagonist. But when we focused on the gameplay using echoes and had Link copying and pasting things into the game field, the sword and shield got in the way."

 <p>
  In retrospect, this development decision makes complete sense, considering the amount of freedom
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  gives players to create their own progression. If Link were the game's protagonist, it might have removed that feature entirely. That being said, perhaps
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's story could have simply taken Link's weapons away from him, forcing him to use the Tri Rod and the echoes it can create to move forward in the game.

  Despite Nintendo's Sentiment About Link's Sword, It Still Managed to Find Its Way Into Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
 </h3>
 <p>
  Regardless of whether Link's sword got in the way of
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's unique gameplay during development, it still managed to find its way into the game via Zelda's Swordfighter Form. Fairly early on in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's story, Zelda acquires Link's "mysterious sword." Upon obtaining the blade, Zelda gains the Swordfighter Form, which allows her to briefly transform into a Link-esque version of herself who can fight with a sword using a similar move set to the iconic tunic-wearing hero. She even makes the same battle cries and grunts that Link is known for while the form is active.

  Future Installments May Continue to Find Foregoing Link's Sword to Be a Tall Order

 <p>
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Swordfighter Form just goes to show how difficult it is to exclude Link's sword from the picture. This is likely not due to
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Tri Rod and echo system being unable to account for Link's skill with a sword, as it's possible to play through most of the game's content without even using the Swordfighter Form. It's also likely not even an indication of a lack of innovative ideas on Grezzo and Nintendo's part, as the ingenuity of both developers has been proven in the past.

 <p>
  The Swordfighter Form's presence in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , and therefore the inclusion of Link's sword, may merely highlight the challenge of attempting to erase a trademark piece of the series' gameplay and image that has been around since its humble beginnings nearly four decades ago. There is a wide variety of different approaches for players to take in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , but they simply aren't enough to reverse decades of one of the series' most recognizable gameplay elements — and that may remain true of future installments.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
  </strong>
  outlet has suggested that the Activision franchise almost collaborated with
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  earlier this year, but it was canceled.
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has seen many collaborations over multiple installments, but one nearly brought the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  universe to the Activision shooter.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  series' have grown in tandem, seeing massive success during the seventh console generation.
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  (2019) was the first to offer crossover cosmetics like
  <em>
   The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  's Skin Crawler and
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  's Billy the Puppet Operator Skins. Unlike
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  hasn't expanded into cosmetic options from other intellectual properties, and character customization typically focuses on Spartan armor. One known source for
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  information has stated that
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  could've had
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  cosmetics introduced to its lineup.

  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  outlet Charlie Intel recently tweeted about
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  nearly collaborating this year. According to the leaker, the reasons for the collaboration's cancelation are unknown. There were rumors about a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  collaboration with
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  earlier this year, but they never came to fruition. These rumors may have been credible given Charlie Intel's post. As
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  publisher Activision was purchased by Microsoft, the overall idea for both franchises to crossover may still happen.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is set to release later this month, which could mean the idea was proactively applied to the upcoming game instead of
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Because Activision seemingly plans to continue offering cosmetics beyond
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , there's still a chance that Master Chief could make an appearance in the series. Beyond simply adding new cosmetics to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  like an Operator Skin, Weapon Charm, or Weapon Blueprint, a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  collaboration has tons of potential. If this crossover happened, there might be a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  -themed game mode, weapons, and more added to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  weapons and game modes could conversely end up in
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  , a game that hasn't been as involved in collaborations as
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . Two
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  collaborations that have already been confirmed are Little Caesars and Monster Energy.

  While the item-based endings are a surefire to trigger, other endings, especially the Maria one, are tricky. You'll need to put in the effort and perform specified actions carefully while avoiding others to trigger a specified ending. Any lapse before the game's end might get you a totally different ending.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise revolutionized the survival horror genre in 1996 when the first entry in the series hit stores. The franchise has since had a plethora of releases on numerous different consoles and has even recently been able to remaster and remake a lot of its classic titles for the new generation.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is also known for its memorable and often difficult boss encounters, featuring some of the most powerful bosses in gaming history.

    Updated October 14th, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
   </strong>
   The sheer number of monsters, creatures, abominations, transfigured humans, creepy crawlies, and so much more in across all the Resident Evil games is staggering. There are so many memorable biomutants in these games, and not all of them are created equal. For example, despite how memorable something like Nemesis is, it doesn't really compare to the HAOS bioweapons. With that in mind, let's take a long look at some of the strongest, scariest, and most memorable terror-inducing lifeforms across the Resident Evil franchise and talk about what exactly makes each one of them so masterclass.

  Starting things off with Marguerite Baker, the matriarch of the Baker family and one of the most horrifying
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  characters in existence. Marguerite seems to be just a step or two down from Jack Baker in terms of raw Mold powers and regenerative ability, but as far as purely disgusting powers go, she's at the top of the food chain.

  Not only does the 'blood' coming out of her seem to be an irritant of sorts, but her entire lower abdomen has become an engorged hive for her mutant insects. All-in-all, Marguerite has superhuman strength, speed, regenerative ability, can control mutant insects, can crawl on walls, and is just generally terrifying to look at.

  This is one of the rare entries on this list that's scary more for gameplay reasons than it is in terms of design or hypothetical power. Something about this mutated man still having some form of himself left in there with his constant repeating of the word 'Mayday' and asking not to be shot. It's also incredibly memorable because players can find the diary of this Communications Officer and read his entries detailing his descent into becoming an abomination, which is one of the most horrifying aspects of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  in general, the transformative horror.

 <p>
  As far as 'power' goes, the Scagdead isn't all that worth mentioning, as it's just tanky, can summon basic mobs, and can swing its appendages around, but many people regard this boss as one of their favorite encounters in
  <em>
   RE: Revelations

  , and it's understandable why they feel that way.

  While the Ustanak probably isn't a
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  villain name that immediately comes to most fans' minds, it's still one of the more powerful bioweapons and it was basically the secondary antagonist of Resident Evil 6. This thing chases Jake and Sherry all throughout the game, culminating in a final fight against the creature where Jake one-ups Chris Redfield and punches a literal slab of meat (AKA the Ustanak) in the face while Christ just punches a boulder.

  Ignoring the fact that this monster was literally beat down by a human, the Ustanak is still an absolute powerhouse of a monster that's entirely faithful to Carla Radames. While it's regeneration is incredible, it's a step below a lot of other creatures on this list due to the fact it can't regenerate lost limbs. Still, where the Ustanak is a major step ahead of a lot of other
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  monsters is in its intelligence. This thing is smart enough to use tools and even to switch attachments for its metal arm on the fly to suit its current situation, where this is swapping to a drill to get through walls, a shotgun to take out opponents, a wrecking ball to cause havoc, or a claw for taking down opponents non-lethally. In general, the Ustanak doesn't have very many unique abilities, but its ingenuity and intelligence are enough to make it an absolute menace to Jake and Sherry's adventure.

  Compared to the other 3 'lords' in Resident Evil: Village, Salvatore Moreau may seem like the weakest among them, but that's actually not the case. Despite not having a very 'human looking' unmated form and turning into a giant disgusting fish when he does transform, Salvatore is actually pretty powerful. For one, he's gigantic while transformed and seems to have an equal or greater amount of regenerative ability than almost all of the other Bioweapons on this list.

 <p>
  Two, his overflowing cell growth exhibits itself in this disgusting mucus he expels, and he can also control this to trap prey. And third, he has the ability to launch highly corrosive stomach acid at a high velocity or even blast it into the sky to create a sort of deadly acid rain. Sadly it does seem like Salvatore was sort of losing control over his mutation by the time Ethan Winters fights him, and sadly he's overlooked often due to his hideous appearance, but Salvatore is actually a pretty incredibly strong Bioweapon overall.

 <p>
  Essentially the grand villain of the original Resident Evil 2, Willaim Birkin worked alongside Albert Wesker to try and kill the Founder of Umbrella James Marcus. Eventually, Birkin would become a product of his own mutations at the hands of the G-Virus as it was the only way to avoid bleeding out after being shot to 'death' by an Umbrella Firing Squad. After mutating and fighting back against his attackers, some rats get infected with the T-Virus, which is what eventually leads to the T-Virus spreading across Racoon City.

 <p>
  At a bioweapon, Birkin has some of the most absurd regenerative powers in the series to date, and taking damage only seems to make him stronger. But, the most terrifying part is, Birkin was barely even around for a full day as a full B.O.W. and he was that powerful. Compared to a lot of other Resident Evil bosses who had years or even decades with their powers, Birkin grew exponentially in such a short amount of time.

 <p>
  Speaking of regenerative-focused B.O.Ws, let's talk about Lisa Trevor. Lisa is first seen in the Gamecube remake of Resident Evil, and she's such a tragic character. Suffering as a test subject all her life, Lisa was exposed to multiple parasites and viruses that steadily mutated her more and more. When players encounter her in the Remake, she's entirely lost her mind (and understandably so) and is looking for her mother while the skinned face of, presumably her own mother, is draped over her head.

 <p>
  Lisa Trevor is by far one of the most 'invincible' B.O.Ws in the entirety of the Resident Evil IP. While she doesn't sport nearly the same amount of combat potential as most of the other bosses on this list, she survives so many encounters that would prove lethal for anyone (or anything) else. Even in death, Lisa couldn't escape being a test subject, as Wesker apparently used her corpse to eventually create the G-Virus as well.

 <p>
  With the massively successful
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 Remake
  </em>
  in March 2023, a lot of
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  fans were reintroduced to characters like Jack Krauser and quickly reminded just how powerful this guy is. While he may not look or speak in an 'intimidating' manner as one might expect a powerful bio-weapon to be, Jack Krauser is actually one of the most powerful mutated organisms in the entire franchise. A large portion of this comes from the fact that he's able to keep his human intellect/ego while also gaining all the benefits of the T-Virus, which is a large part of why other human characters like Wesker or Derek Simmons are so strong as well.

 <p>
  Besides this, Jack is also just an incredibly experienced soldier, comparable to Leon in many ways. Add his mutated form on top of all that, which has both offensive and defensive capabilities, and Krauser is pretty much impossible for anyone without some seriously heavy ordinance to take out.

 <p>
  Of all Mother Miranda's mutated lieutenants in
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  , Heisenberg is the strongest. While this may seem a bit silly considering he's just a guy with a hammer who isn't very scary and the other lieutenants are a 10-foot vampire queen, a disgusting fish monstrosity, and a living Chuckie doll, it's still true that he's the strongest among them.

 <p>
  There's a reason why Magneto is one of the most well-known and powerful mutants in the
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  franchise, the ability to control metal is very overpowered, especially in the modern age. While Heisenberg's electromagnetic abilities aren't nearly as strong as Magneto's during the combat in his boss fight, they're enough to put him among the best of the best
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  villains, and that's not even taking his intellect, ingenuity, or determination into account either.

 <p>
  Another one of Mother Miranda's lieutenants, Lady D, otherwise known as Alcina Dimitescu, is by far the most recognizable character of
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  . It's sort of difficult not to notice a 10-foot tale posh vampire noble, after all. As a Cadou-infected bio-weapon, Lady Dimitrescu is absurdly powerful. Not only does her height/size give her superhuman strength, but she has hyper-regeneration, doesn't age, has the ability to grow her nails at will, and can even transform into a fully mutated state.

 <p>
  The only real 'downside' for Dimitrescu is the blood disease she was born with, which led to her having a pretty demanding dependence on ingesting human flesh and blood. But in all honesty, this really never seemed to be too much of a downside, in the grand scheme of things.

  The
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  series has had so many bosses that are mutated forms of humans that it'd be more of a surprise at this point to find a final boss wasn't some disgusting monster in disguise. Still, this common occurrence is used so often because it provides some truly memorable and visually atmospheric fights, with the battle against Queen Leech, the primary antagonist of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 0
  </em>
  , being one of the better examples.

 <p>
  Back during the time period this game first came out, mutated bosses were still a relatively fresh concept in
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , making Queen Leech's sudden transformation all the more terrifying.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  is still considered by many to be one of the best horror games of all time. Granted, the game absolutely went for more of an 'arcade shooter' gameplay loop than previous games, but this surprisingly also worked in its favor.

 <p>
  Despite this action-oriented gameplay, there are still plenty of terrifying moments and fear-inducing monsters. One such encounter is U-3, otherwise known as 'It' to Salazar. This human centipede-esque monstrosity basically takes Leon's whole arsenal of weaponry to kill, and that's not even including the fact that, while fighting U-3, players will need to progress through a series of hanging rooms that drop into what feels like an endless abyss, after a certain amount of time has passed

  The T-078 is an even more powerful version of the original Tyrant, and it makes a rather frustrating appearance in
  <em>
   Code Veronica.
  </em>
  That's not even taking the game's tank controls into consideration, rather it's just that difficult of a fight. Players get to experience the unstoppable T-078 on Rockfort Island, as it was sent to kill both of the game's primary protagonists, Claire and Steve.

 <p>
  Its Super Tyrant form thats encountered on the airplane off the island, in particular, is extra challenging. While this was Umbrella's attempt at 'mass-producing' Tyrants, that absolutely doesn't mean T-078 was a pushover, as this monster was almost unstoppable in its pursuit of Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside.

  , he was arguably the most threatening, especially in the earlier parts of the game. For one, he overpowers Leon multiple times throughout the first half of
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  and would have easily killed him if not for Salazar's interference. Second, because of the Dominant Species Plaga that Mendez was infected with, he was far beyond human limits in terms of durability, strength, and adaptability.

  When Leon attempts to kill him in the locked Slaughterhouse by shooting an explosive barrel, Mendez uses his Plaga to mutate himself into a horrifying centipede-like form. In this form, Mendez is able to climb whatever he pleases, still has considerable amounts of power, and doesn't even care if his lower half is completely destroyed. Overall, while not nearly as much of a threat as some of the other tall and stoic villains such as Mr. X or Nemesis, Mendez is still a true powerhouse and an icon of the franchise.

 <p>
  While almost all of the big bosses in
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  are far above regular human standards, Mother Miranda is the one who created them all, and as such she's the most powerful overall. Yes, Lady Dimitrescu is a vampire who can turn into a 'dragon' of sorts, and sure, Heisenberg is basically a budget Magneto, but Mother Miranda controls the Megamycete that created their powers in the first place, and as such is almost entirely unkillable.

 <p>
  The build-up to the Mother Miranda boss fight is fantastic, as she appears or is mentioned more and more as Ethan makes his way through all of her 'children'. And, when players finally come face to face with her, the boss battle itself is pretty cinematic. If Rose's powers (Ethan's daughter) are any indication of the upper limit of what Mother Miranda could have become, then she's absolutely one of the strongest villains in the series to date.

  Verdugo isn't just one creature, it's the name of a series of BOWs (Bio-Organic Weapons) made by fusing insects and humans together. The Verdugo that players know the best, however, is the red-cloaked one that Leon encounters in the sewer (and is typically seen next to Salazar). Here, most players choose to escape from the Verdugo, rather than attempt to kill it, as the creature's tough carapace seems to tank just about everything, and resources in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games are often scarce. The truly terrifying thing about the Verdugo, however, is how smart they are. Not only do they follow complex orders from Salazar, but they will also stalk their prey, tease them, and even utilize complex tactics against them.

 <p>
  However, choosing to confront Leon in this area full of liquid nitrogen canisters was a really dumb move for the Verdugo, as it takes triple the amount of damage while frozen using these canisters. The only other 'relatively easy' way to kill this thing outside of freezing it, is to use a Rocket Launcher which is what most players tend to reserve theirs for in the original game. Sadly, the U-III isn't anywhere to be found in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 R
  </em>
  emake, though many speculate it'll appear in a future update or even in the Ada Wong DLC 'Separate Ways'.

  Since this next creature, the T-00 better known as Mr. X was literally the precursor to Nemesis, it's sadly not quite as strong as Nemesis is. In general, Mr. X has most of the same traits as Nemesis but just not on the same scale. Additionally, Nemesis has much stronger regenerative abilities and is able to use weapons while Mr. X just walks forward menacingly and punches things which, to be fair, seems to work well for it.

  All that said, it really depends on which game most players grew up with first as for which Tyrant is their favorite, Mr. X or Nemesis. But, if it's all broken down to raw stats, Mr. X doesn't lose against many things, but he absolutely loses to Nemesis.

 <p>
  Jack Baker is probably the best example of someone who falls right in between Mr. X and Nemesis in terms of both general power and the scale of his abilities. While Jack's human-form strength doesn't really compare to either of the other Tyrants, his regenerative abilities are arguably better than Nemsis'. Also, while Jack is absolutely out of his mind due to the Mold infection, he is still able to use tactics, strategies, and tricks, which also puts him far above many of the other tyrants.

 <p>
  But most of all, Jack has a gigantic mutated form after taking enough damage which is really only stopped with a specific serum meant to 'cure' the Mold. So, while Jack may lose to a lot of other entries on this list, he would often still come out on top by slowly wearing them down over time like he did with Ethan. And, if that somehow didn't work then he would resort to his final (very gross) form.

 <p>
  Yeah, it doesn't get much more powerful than the Nemesis. The Nemesis T-Type was the primary antagonist of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  as well as the Remake and it spends most of its time chasing Jill while she attempts to expose Umbrella's crimes. Not only is Nemesis a new type of Tyrant, one that is capable of more rational thought and the ability to use weapons, but it mutates as a response to the damage it's taken. Originally, Nemesis is seen in its most iconic form, the large brown lipless monster in a large leather suit.

 <p>
  But, as Jill deals more damage to it through the course of her journey (or it damages itself), Nemesis goes through multiple transformations, eventually ending up as a gigantic blob whose only weakness is an experimental Ferromagnetic Infantry-use Next Generation Railgun AKA the 'FINGR'.

  While
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  and especially
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  are polarizing games that started to take the franchise in a new direction, such as putting more of the focus on co-op play,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
  </em>
  spins the wheel in the complete opposite direction. This is the first mainline game to go first-person, among many other changes to longtime
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  staples. And, while not everyone in the fanbase was thrilled with these changes, they can at least admit that the Baker family was truly terrifying and memorable as antagonists.

  And, the mastermind behind these monstrocities as well as the progenitor of the Mold was Eveline, otherwise known as E-001. Eveline is one of the only genetically engineered bio-weapons to specialize in victory without combat, as she is able to control the minds (and therefore the actions) of all those around her. Because of this, it's almost impossible to actually 'kill' Eveline unless the person attacking her finds a way to resist said mind control, which is where Ethan Winters comes in.

  Derek Simmons might be one of the easiest
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  characters to hate of all time, but fans can't help but admit how terrifyingly strong he was in his
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  appearance. As the head of an organization called 'The Family', Derek basically had the entire world at his fingertips and was even able to kidnap thousands of women just for the sake of trying to create a clone of Ada Wong, the love of his life. The plot threads of these games are always nonsensical so to make a long story short, he succeeded in turning a woman named Carla Radames into another Ada Wong, but she betrayed him and eventually infected him with her own version of the C-Virus, turning Derek into a bioweapon himself.

  So now there's this Bioweapon who is technically still the head of an Illuminati-esque secret society, is intelligent beyond all belief, will do anything for his goals, and can transform back and forth between different human and mutated forms with ease. So, it's safe to say that he was pretty powerful, both literally and politically

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the most popular JRPG franchises of all time. Square got the ball rolling with the very first entry in the series, paving the way for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  to become a household name that many fans are familiar with. The series may be struggling to form an identity in the modern era, but most fans don't mind this experimentation as long as they get to enjoy some different and engaging games that make full use of the series' tropes and recurring themes.

  Moogles are one of the cutest video game characters who have been a stalwart presence across multiple
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games. These mascots have become synonymous with the series, serving as a charming addition to any game they're featured in. While some
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games may not feature moogles in a prominent role, they still have some references to these cute creatures, hammering in just how important they are in this franchise.

  It's a shame that a lot of people aren't even aware of MiniMog from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  , given how useful this pseudo-GF can be when the situation calls for it. For what it's worth, the original release of this game locked the Mog's Amulet item that taught this command behind a PocketStation game almost no one played. Thankfully.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8 Remastered
  </em>
  did the right thing and integrated this item into the main game, which could be obtained via Angelo Search.

 <p>
  With this amulet, players can teach any GF the MiniMog command, letting them revive and heal their Guardian Forces mid-combat at the cost of Gil. It's the only way to heal these GFs mid-battle, making it puzzling as to why more people don't talk about MiniMog all that often. Sure, the chances of acquiring the amulet with Angelo Search are pretty rare, but that shouldn't stop players from grinding one out to enjoy one of the most unique commands in the game.

  It takes a while for players to get their hands on the first summon materia in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  . The party doesn't acquire one until they leave Midgar, making it clear to players that these powerful abilities need a lot of work to acquire. While Choco/Mog may lose its effectiveness as the game progresses, it's still a useful summon players can rely on till the mid-game, with the comedic value of this attack adding to the charm of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  .

  Two attacks can be triggered with the Choco/Mog materia. One of these attacks summons a Fat Chocobo that flattens enemies, while the other summons a Chocobo being ridden by a moogle that charges at enemies. It's a hilarious attack, and it helps that said moogle is so adorable that fans will love relying on this attack until they get their hands on more powerful materia.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  is a darker game than its predecessors, featuring a story rife with political intrigue coupled with some dark themes that make for one of the most mature
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  experiences of all time. Any moment of levity would be appreciated in such a serious title, and the simple inclusion of a moogle ensures that fans wouldn't be disappointed in this department. Players can embark on a series of challenging hunts in this title, and it's low-key hilarious that the creature in charge of these hunts is a moogle.

  Nektar is one of the more useful moogles in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series, giving Clive all the information he needs to tackle these challenging battles. The majority of these hunts push
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  's combat to new heights, and it's a shame that the majority of the game's battles are so easy in comparison that Clive can breeze past these encounters without using the bulk of his skills. Regardless, players will love any excuse to interact with this cute moogle to get more hunts and beat down the toughest enemies in the game.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  is one of the best games in the series, blending classic and modern
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  elements to make for a winning combination. Suffice it to say, moogles play a major role in this game, with the majority of these characters serving as save points that players must interact with to ensure that they don't lose their progress in the event of a defeat.

 <p>
  All of these moogles have unique names but perform the same functions. Aside from saving, players can heal up using a tent, shop for goodies in some instances, and interact with the Mognet system for a fun side activity. Watching these moogles flamboyantly slam a book to the ground as they make a record of the party's adventure never ceases to be amazing and adds to the game's charm.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  is the only game where a moogle serves as a permanent party member. Players do control a set of moogles early on when they must save Terra from Imperial Forces, and one of these moogles — conveniently named Mog — can become a permanent party member in both the World of Balance and Ruin if one plays their cards right.

 <p>
  Going for the Gold Hairpin instead of Mog may seem more appealing early on, but players will miss their chance to learn some valuable Dances that can enhance the moogle's repertoire of skills. While executing a Dance can lead to Mog stumbling and the lack of control may frustrate players, players won't mind as long as they can automate certain attacks to take advantage of an enemy's weakness. The fact that players can use Mog as a playable party member makes it clear why he's one of the most iconic moogles in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  history.

  A talented fan of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  dressed up as Triss Merigold and shared her work online.
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  attracts millions of fans worldwide by telling the story of the iconic Geralt of Rivia, which has been adapted for different media.

  One of the most popular adaptations is the series of games developed by CD Projekt Red. It all started with the release of
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  in 2007, followed by
  <em>
   The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings
  </em>
  in 2011, and the hit
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  in 2015. With the games, fans have seen a series of characters come to life as playable characters or NPCs, including Triss Merigold. One of the NPCs in the third game in the series, Triss is a powerful sorceress who, throughout her life, crosses paths with Geralt and Yennefer, as well as founding the organization of female mages known as the Lodge of Sorceresses.

 <p>
  Paying homage to the iconic character, Reddit user FioraCosplay shared her Triss Merigold cosplay online. Based on the alternative look unlocked through one of
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's DLCs, the cosplayer wears a dress that reproduces Triss' green robe, with elaborate gold inlay all over the outfit. Another eye-catching detail is the sleeves of the dress, which have the same design, whose inner part is red, with the outer part having brown details reminiscent of tree branches. To add an extra layer of immersion, the cosplayer wears the same hairstyle as Triss, with small braids in front of her face, and an impressive gold accessory with blue stones.

  According to the OP, Triss Merigold's costume was completely made by her, with patterns created by fellow cosplayer Jak Cosplay. On her Instagram profile, she says that she dressed up as the character from
  <em>

  </em>
  to attend the Elbenwald Festival, an event that has been held every year since 2018 in Germany. In the comments section, other Redditors praised the cosplayer, highlighted her work on the embroidery, and commented that she looks like Orianna, one of the most intriguing
  <em>
   Witcher
  </em>
  characters.

 <p>
  PlayStation took to X, Instagram and Facebook to change its profile photos and cover photos to be based on the beloved
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  soon after the game's release on Friday. The big-budget mascot 3D platformer is a full game follow up to the PS5 built-in game
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  , with Captain Bot having to go on a rescue mission in order to save members of his team of little robots following an alien attack. Throughout its hours of gameplay, players will discover many cameos of iconic PlayStation characters that have been robotified for the purpose of the game, with even more cameos being hinted to come post-launch.

  Platforming mascots have long been celebrated by PlayStation, who unlike competitors, would prop up a number of mascot characters at a given time. Crash Bandicoot and Spyro were just two beloved icons from PlayStation's early days who have been given the star treatment, the PS2 era had several mascots of its own, Sackboy debuted in the PS3 era, and now
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  joins that elite circle.

  First debuted in 2013's Playroom for PS4,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  got his leading role in the 2018 release of the PSVR-exclusive
  <em>
   Astro Bot Rescue Mission
  </em>
  . It wouldn't be until 2020 that Captain Bot would next be available for the console, with
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  helping to teach players about the DualSense capabilities beloved on PS5. The early Friday morning propping up of
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  on social media platforms also comes as PlayStation gears up for its 30th anniversary celebrations, and fans like Reddit user IcePopsicleDragon made note of the big change.

  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  has been received extremely well by critics, having secured the spot for 2nd best game of the year and already surpassing the mark for 74th best game of all time. Many critics are praising its gameplay and the inclusion of characters from PlayStation's past, filling
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  with tons of nostalgic elements. The move to promote
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  in a social media blitz came as a pleasant surprise to fans, who were already familiar with the character in previous entries but had yet to dub Captain Astro as an iconic mascot, despite his official status from PlayStation. Now, though, it is certainly safe to say that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Astro Bot
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been cemented as the current PlayStation mascot.

   There are 14 Chapters in The Casting of Frank Stone
  </strong>
  featured in the game, and each will push the narrative towards one of the numerous endings. While the game may
  <strong>
   start in 1963
  </strong>
  , a large portion of the game will take place in modern 2024, as well as events that transpired between the two in 1980.

  The game has many collectibles, such as all of the game’s Relliks, that can extend the duration of the game thanks to having the players take some extra time to look around every corner of the map — or pick up an item to access a specific place later on. The game features many elements to keep players in the game long after the credits roll. There is a feature called The Cutting Room Floor that will let players change how events played out at different points in the game. Revisiting these locations can allow the player to collect items they may have missed on their first run.

 <p>
  Players will need to use this feature in order to collect all of the game’s Trinkets and all of the game’s Artifacts — which can sometimes lie on different paths based on player choices. Players that did not care about such things on their first run could see hunting them down on their own for an additional couple of hours — but using guides to know exactly where they are can trim this down to under a single hour.

  Lastly, the game features multiple endings, including an ending where everyone survives and an ending where everyone meets their untimely end. This means that players will need to dive into many conflicting situations if they intend to get the full experience offered by the game.

  It would be difficult to find another gaming franchise that has been as impactful on the strategy game genre in the last 30 years as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sid Meier's Civilization
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. While the franchise has had its ups and downs in terms of structural issues, every single
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  game has been a trailblazer in the genre.

 <p>
  These turn-based strategy games are all about exploring the world, building up a strong economic foundation, making holistic alliances with rivals, and advancing through the decades to experience different ages. Be it the Renaissance era, the Stone Age, or the nuclear-powered modern era, there's so much depth and tactical nuance in these games that players can easily sink hundreds of hours into them. The entire series is known for its fun combat systems and world-building, and while every game is spectacular in its own right, they all have their own strengths and weaknesses and this ranking explores that.

  <em>
   Sid Meier's prestigious Civilization series has been at the forefront of turn-based strategy games for decades. Civilization VII is set to release in February 2025 and recent reveals have led to tons of anticipation and hype among fans. Meanwhile, the success of the strategy genre in recent times can be seen by the incredible reception of Unicorn Overlord and upcoming releases such as Ara: History Untold and Songs of Silence. Similar to the Civilization series, the recent release of Age of Mythology Retold means that fans of strategy games are due a one-two punch of the two most iconic franchises in the genre. In light of this recent boom in the genre and the much anticipated release of Civilization VII, this is the best time for an in-depth revisiting of the Civilization series, focusing on what makes each game special.

  <em>
   Beyond Earth
  </em>
  was Sid Meier's second foray into a more Sci-fi and futuristic world. Similar to the
  <em>
   Alpha Centauri
  </em>
  game, it presented a leap from the series' status quo. While the base game was similar,
  <em>
   Beyond Earth
  </em>
  lets players travel through space and conquer different planets.

 <p>
  <em>
   Beyond Earth
  </em>
  had its own quest system and focused more on developing technology. Moreover, this game's version of barbarians (the aliens) were much stronger and couldn't just be ignored. The addition of affinities and the renewed focus on conquering other opponents as well as the new space-focused features all worked out well and made this a well-rounded and exciting game.

  <em>
   Civilization Revolution
  </em>
  was the franchise's first foray into non-PC gaming platforms. It featured on the PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo DS, and even the IOS store. These games were obviously not as complex or feature-heavy as the others in the franchise, but they were solid additions regardless. The first game's graphical weaknesses and lack of proper multiplayer systems did hold it back, unfortunately.

  The game that started it all cannot be ignored.
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  was the first game in the series, and it stands out as one of the most iconic and influential games in the entire franchise, if not of all time. The original game features most of the classic features players are accustomed to, be it using settlers at the start of the game, starting the game well in the past, or slowly developing technology.

 <p>
  At the time, this game was a revelation, and it inspired an entire franchise and countless other games in the genre. The turn-based warfare on a large scale, based on historical empires, was a breath of fresh air. The added focus on development and diplomacy, as opposed to just fighting, was the perfect combination for success. However, considering some of the amazing games in the series today, it falls short of the top rankings.

  <em>
   Civilization 2

  was the much-anticipated sequel to the franchise's modest beginnings. It didn't change much from the original game, focusing more on balance, and improving enemy AI, and polishing the mechanics.
  <em>
   Civilization 2
  </em>
  did, however, make some important additions. It added world wonders and a focus on diplomatic relations. These features are still relevant to the series today.

  <em>

  was an incredible game in its own right. It was critically praised and sold well and allowed the developers to focus more on the franchise as a whole.

  The current
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  game has been out for the better part of a decade now, and it is one of the best in the series. It's one of the most acclaimed and popular games in the genre, winning multiple awards and still relentlessly played to this date. The new hex grid, coupled with the new manner of city development which allows players to expand their cities into districts, is both rewarding, and a great visual cue. This has also led to different strategies when it comes to laying siege to a rival, a matter made even better with the new unit stacking changes.

  The game has taken solid features from most previous iterations, polished and solidified them whilst also featuring some of the coolest units in the series. The game has solid graphics, amazing narration by Sean Bean, and some interesting new civilizations and leaders for players to sink their teeth into.

  <em>
   Civilization 3
  </em>
  followed up from the previous games with the simple philosophy of more is better. This game added tons of new iconic civilizations and added more features, making strategy, planning, and micromanaging even more important. Players had to manage their citizen's contentment. In addition, there was a new focus on cultural victories, and the diplomatic systems were refined further as well.

 <p>
  This was a very complete game with little left to be desired. It is still considered one of the highest-rated games in the genre and set new standards for the series. It was further bolstered by solid expansion packs, and updates for bug fixes and glitches. Overall,
  <em>
   Civilization III,
  </em>
  at the time of its release, may have been the best strategy game out there. It rightfully won a multitude of awards and is still the subject of fanfare today.

  While this game doesn't have the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  moniker, it qualifies as a
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  game in every aspect, and is actually one of the best strategy and 4x games to come out in the 21st Century. Players are sent outer-space to establish their colony bases whilst fighting off aliens and expanding their colony. The gameplay loop is nearly identical to most games in the franchise, just with a few outer space quirks.

 <p>
  Released at the turn of the millenium, this game holds up quite well to this date, featuring intuitive controls and solid mechanics that feature in more recent titles as well. The game is also a bit darker than most entries in the franchise, with features such as nerve stapling standing out. The story is quite solid with some interesting underlying themes and has a satisfying conclusion. While the graphics aren't the best, this is still an exceptional game, the only caveat being it may feel very similar to
  <em>
   Civilization 2
  </em>
  in some ways.

  <em>

  introduced the new hexagonal grids that are present in its successor as well. These grids make the overall layout of the game feel better. They are also easier on the eyes, making the presentation of the game much better. The game also introduced the new city-state feature. This makes the game much more nuanced and complex, as the player needs to manage their diplomatic relations with these states as well. Players can eventually pivot this into allowing the state to become a part of their civilization as well.

 <p>
  In conclusion, this game made great strides to modernize the series and bolstered the content available in the game. Especially with all the new civilizations, players have tons of content to play through. Many hardcore fans of the series still laud
  <em>
   Civilization 5
  </em>
  as being unmatched in the genre.

 <p>
  The fourth mainline game in the Sid Meier series is still held in high regard as the best in the series by most.
  <em>
   Civilization 4
  </em>
  has some fantastic music accompanying its solid visuals and unit designs. The game bounces from the standards set up by
  <em>
   Civilization 3
  </em>
  and finds the perfect balance between gameplay, balance, and enemy A.I. The A.I., especially, radically improved, leading to more complex difficulty and making CPU opponents an actual challenge.

 <p>
  <em>
   Civilization IV
  </em>
  made leaps in modernizing the series. Beyond just A.I. improvements, the new interface is arguably the best in the franchise. Moreover, the introduction of Barbarian Cities, the variety of victory options available to players, and the changes towards happiness and corruption all led to an incredible experience. The vassal state and focus on espionage shines here as well. The game seems to find the perfect balance and can be classified as the quintessential game in the series.

   <strong>
    EA Sports UFC 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer EA Vancouver has deployed a brand-new patch update for the popular mixed martial arts fighting game on November 7, adding two new fighters to the ever-expanding roster while also making a handful of improvements and bug fixes. After launching to lukewarm reviews from players back in 2023, EA promised to release a steady stream of new updates to
  <em>
   UFC 5
  </em>
  to reach nearly 100% parity with the UFC's top ten rankings, and the latest update continues that promise.

 <p>
  Rumors are currently swirling of a potential
  <em>
   EA Sports UFC 6
  </em>
  now being in development at EA Vancouver, but that doesn't appear to have stopped the developer from delivering regular content updates to the series' current installment. Celebrating the title's one year anniversary last month, EA acknowledged the outcry from fans at launch surrounding the game's lackluster lineup of fighters, before revealing a total of 70 new rostered fighters had been added to the game since launch (not including the two new fighters in the November 7 patch). After the launch of today's update, there will be a total of 480 fighters in
  <em>
   EA Sports UFC 5
  </em>
  , which also includes alter egos.

 <p>
  While there are some important improvements in the November 7 update, fans will be pleased to know that patch 1.16 is adding two new fighters to
  <em>
   EA Sports UFC 5
  </em>
  : Carlos Prates and Jean Silva. Prates is an up-and-comer in the UFC's Welterweight division, with 3 wins to his name and a scheduled bout with MMA veteran Neil Magny on November 9. Silva, who is a Featherweight fighter in the UFC, is also on 3 fight win streak with the promotion and has been to war with the likes of Drew Dober and Charles Jourdain in his last two bouts.

 <p>
  Alongside the addition of two new fighters, the November 7 update also includes some bug fixes for camera angles and
  <em>
   EA Sports UFC 5
  </em>
  's submission feature. According to the official patch notes, an issue that allowed the submissive fighter to immediately transition out of ground and pound after a diving punch or when the dominant fighter goes to postured mount after pouncing on cage knockdowns has now been rectified.

  Finally, EA is updating
  <em>

  with some important improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro. Following patch 1.16,
  <em>
   EA Sports UFC 5
  </em>
  will have an increased display resolution to 4k during gameplay on the PS5 Pro, as well as an increased frame rate from 30fps to 60fps during KO replays. Unfortunately, these new features won't be available on the standard PlayStation 5, but can be checked out on the console's new Pro model, which launches today.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Carlos Prates
   <ul>
    <li>
     One of two “Fighting Nerds” coming to UFC 5. Carlos made a splash in the UFC by KO’ing his opponent in the second round and since then he has rattled off two more KO victories. Prates’ fighting style is Muay Thai through and through, he uses each of his eight limbs to devastate his opponents until they can no longer stand with him and decide to shoot for a takedown but by then it’s too late, and the next thing they know they are looking up at the ref asking what happened. Precise fast striking, clean footwork and good takedown defense are what you get with Prates in UFC 5.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Jean Silva
   <ul>
    <li>
     To say Jean Silva is a wild man is an understatement, just take a look at his post-fight debut where he barks at the camera after knocking out his opponent in the first round, or the war he had in his last fight with the ultra-tough Drew Dober. “Lord” may get a little wild but he’s also well-rounded, strong, and can take a punch or two or three. Silva is also on a three-fight win streak in the UFC, a testament to his team and training with the Fighting Nerds. Powerful punches and kicks and a stellar takedown defense round out Silva’s game in UFC 5.

  Popular YouTuber MrRoflWaffles' high round attempt in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Zombies came to an early demise after the content creator ended the match instead of saving and quitting. This feature is new for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , as are several other tweaks and changes, and it seems like some players are still getting used to the new save and quit system.

  Coming off of last year's controversial
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  , which received mixed reviews and was criticized for its campaign,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  comes equipped with a brand-new story mode, revamped multiplayer, and, of course, the next chapter of the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies saga.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is still making waves weeks after its release earlier this fall, especially with its Zombies mode, in which players are banding together to uncover the best high-round strategies, though one player's recent attempt ended in disaster.

  Veteran YouTuber and
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  content creator Milo, also known as MrRoflWaffles, faced an unforced error after forgetting to save and quit their recent
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  match. A clip of the blunder was shared by Milo on Twitter, who was streaming at the time of making the mistake. The YouTuber had managed to make their way through 147 rounds on the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies map Liberty Falls before accidentally backing out and losing their progress.

  The clip shows Milo pausing the match before unknowingly hitting the "leave" button instead of saving. Milo had sunk a total of 12 hours into the attempt, making it to round 147 before it all came crashing down. While this is certainly an impressive number, high rounds have evolved considerably compared to old-school
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  maps. With
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's new Jet Gun, and enough patience, players can easily crank out a few dozen rounds on Liberty Falls.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  seeks to make high rounds more approachable with its new save and quit system, though it's important that players actually use this feature correctly if they want to keep their progress.

  Zombies released with two round-based maps to start, Terminus and Liberty Falls, and while the former may be more satisfying for those looking for complex gameplay, the latter has been a goldmine for those wanting to put their skills and mental stamina to the test. While players immediately began searching for the best high-round attempts once
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  was officially released in October, the race really began once Treyarch upped the total round cap from 256 to 999 in a recent update. Since this change, players have been attempting to become the new world champion when it comes to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  is releasing a physical version of Genius Invokation TCG, but only in China for the time being.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  fans have long waited for physical card sets of the game, and it seems HoYoverse will finally deliver.

  Despite not being as popular as other permanent game modes like the Abyss or the Imaginarium Theater,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s Genius Invokation TCG is still beloved among players. The virtual card game was introduced during the Sumeru era in Version 3.3 and its funny connection to the character Cyno is now a popular running gag in the game’s storyline. Genius Invokation TCG PvP matches can only be played in-game, but fortunately for players, this is going to change soon, as the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  TCG is coming to the real world.

  HoYoverse is partnering up with Shining Soul to launch a physical version of Genius Invokation TCG, but it will only be available in China. As confirmed by the manufacturer in a Bilibili post, two decks will go on pre-sale on November 8. The first is a starter deck pack with 40 cards, while the second is a booster pack with 108 cards. Shining Soul also shared some special holographic character cards, but it seems these holographic versions can only be found in booster packs. There are several characters featured on the decks, including Ayaka, Ningguang, Ganyu, and Chongyun. Some World Boss cards like the Liyue Oceanid are also coming. HoYoverse has previously held the Prince Cup and Fonta Cup
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  TCG tournaments, with competitors playing on desktops. A physical version of the card game could prompt even more Genius Invokation TCG competitions worldwide.

  According to Shining Soul, the starter pack will come in eight variations, but all decks come with three character cards, 30 action cards, and seven accessory cards to help beginners form a good base deck. Meanwhile, booster packs provide a wider, random range of cards for more deck options. HoYoverse is potentially releasing the physical decks in China to test their popularity before aiming for a global launch. On the other hand, a physical version of Genius Invokation TCG might be long overdue. Unofficial

  TCG decks and fan merchandise have been selling on various marketplaces like Amazon for a while now. One fan made their own

  TCG cards and even handcrafted the dice.

 <p>
  With five mainline titles in the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  timeline, Batman wears suits unique to their respective game entry that have become famous among fans. However, as the games progressed, developers were kind enough to reward gamers with suits that replicated The Dark Knight's various suits from comic book history.

 <p>
  Many of the comic book-inspired suits for Batman, as well as other characters, take different routes, some try to imitate the comics identically down to the art style, while others adapt the comic book design to fit the game's visual style. They are a treat for not only gamers, but comic book readers who get a nice bit of nostalgia by seeing their favorite comics brought to life digitally.

  Fans of the classic gray and blue color scheme can enjoy this suit, which brings the Batman of the Bronze Era to life in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham City
  </em>
  . The yellow insignia, vibrant blue cowl, and bright gray bodysuit are what make the respective suit of Batman during a time in the comics, when the stories returned to darker tones.

  In the 70s, Batman was brought to life by creators such as Neal Adams, Dennis O'Neil, Len Wein, and Gardner Fox, creating a revamped version of Batman's Golden Age design. It became the new standard for a long time, so much so that the suit was brought back in

  to pay respect to a beloved era of Batman.

 <p>
  It is a shame that Catwoman and other characters cannot freely roam Gotham City in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  because they have well-made skins. Catwoman, for example, was gifted with a DLC suit from her solo comic run from 1993 to 2001 by Jo Duffy and Jim Balent, giving the character a then-modern design that harks back to her first appearance with the purple color scheme.

 <p>
  The skin in
  <em>

  could have easily just pasted the skin onto Catwoman's base design, but Rocksteady went even further by giving her a more comic accurate design with very long hair and wider, doll-like eyes.

  <em>
   The Dark Knight Returns
  </em>
  was a defining Batman graphic novel of the 1980s, with the idea of an older Batman coming out of retirement during a dystopian era. It influenced Batman heavily over the years in comics, animation, and even some live action movies, with
  <em>
   Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice
  </em>
  took concepts and designs straight out of the comic.

 <p>
  Players can play as the stocky and older Batman in both
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham City
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  . However, the Arkham Knight version keeps the same Bruce Wayne character model, which doesn't fit the suit as well. However, Arkham City changes Batman to match how he looked in the graphic novel, with Bruce looking much more brutish with exaggerated body proportions.

  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  still has impressive visuals almost ten years later and Rocksteady used those visuals to create updated versions of famous suits that would not be ill-fitting for live-action movies. One of these cases is the Flashpoint Batman suit worn by Thomas Wayne in
  <em>
   The Flashpoint Paradox
  </em>
  story, which showed an alternate timeline where Bruce Wayne was killed as a child.

 <p>
  Flashpoint Batman has always been more paramilitary in design and Rocksteady embraced that aspect, giving him plenty of armor, padding, and pouches to fit his gun-toting style. However, Rocksteady maintains the shoulder spikes and red eyes that he is known for as an evil version of Batman, resulting in a suit that is comic accurate while still updated to fit the realistic visuals.

  Tim Drake is known as the third Robin, but he is also known as Red Robin, which became his signature appearance after Batman died in the comics. For some, it helped turn Tim Drake into an iconic version of Robin, which made it an ideal inclusion when Robin became playable in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham City
  </em>
  .

  The cowled version of Robin allows Batman to show his respect towards his adoptive father, Bruce, while embracing a unique identity, similar to what Dick Grayson and Jason Todd did with Nightwing and Red Hood. Sadly, the Red Robin suit did not return in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  , despite Tim Drake returning.

  Batman's suit was drawn with a hexagonal mesh onto his fabric to help show that his suit was technologically advanced, and it was faithfully recreated in

  <em>

  came out toward the end of the New 52 era, when Batman was always designed to be covered in high-tech armor. So, it makes sense that of all the comic book suits to be added to the game, the New 52 design fits Rocksteady's Batman.

  It has all the plate lines that DC fans know and love about the New 52 Batman, which went up against many iconic and evil villains, including the Court Of Owls and Darkseid. The developers even managed to capture the bulky proportions seen in Greg Capullo's artwork with bulbous shoulders and the logo that spans across the entire chest.

  With
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  taking place on Christmas Eve, no suit fits better than the
  <em>
   Batman: Noël
  </em>
  skin, which is taken straight off the page of Lee Bermejo's illustrations. It has the symbol connected to the cape, the more rugged Kevlar-esque material, and a militaristic utility belt.

 <p>
  Lee Bermejo's Batman has become an iconic suit in the comics since
  <em>
   Batman: Noël
  </em>
  came out in 2011. Not only was it featured in the famous prequel game, but fans loved it so much that Rocksteady brought it back in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  , where it looks even better with the enhanced fidelity.

 <p>
  Batman and DC wouldn't be what they are today without
  <em>
   Detective Comics #27
  </em>
  , and Rocksteady paid tribute to that by including the original Batman suit in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  . The long slanted ears are present alongside the purple gloves, earless symbol, and shorter cape, a design that continues to influence modern Batman suits, including
  <em>
   Batman: Caped Crusader
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While the suit first appeared in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  version improved on it in nearly every way, down to the detail of the fabric of the suit looking like Batman is wearing a modified longsleeve shirt. The First Appearance suit may not fit the technologically advanced style of
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  , but it remains a historical suit to traverse Gotham City with.

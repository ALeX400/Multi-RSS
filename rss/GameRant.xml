 <p>
  December is all around us, and it is the perfect time to play some
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The mobile game has hosted spotlight hours for a little over 4 years now, and it is still going strong as the end of another year comes closer. Every Tuesday, which is when the events take place, players will be able to get a large amount of whatever Pokemon is selected for that spotlight hour, which could lead to a Shiny or just a really powerful Pokemon with an excellent moveset.

  During this event, players will also have the chance to gain some extra rewards to benefit from their in-game experience while catching Pokemon, such as getting different types of candy, XP, or Stardust, which are all important currencies in the game that help give players more of a boost. Candy and Stardust are used to level up and evolve their Pokemon or teach them new moves. Here are the
  <em>

  </em>
  spotlight hours scheduled for December 2024.

  Players will be getting a total of five spotlight hours this month, leading up to a pretty good lineup for Pokemon before the holidays and the end of the year. These
  <strong>
   spotlight hours take place between 6 PM and 7 PM every Tuesday
  </strong>
  , local time for the player.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  is very accommodating in the sense of not having to follow any other time zone, but the one players are in. So, at 6 pm for the player's local time, it will also be that time in the game, unlike other games that go on their own day and night cycle.

 <p>
  During the spotlight hour timeframe, players won't have to put in any extra effort other than logging on and playing, as players will begin to see the map covered in the Pokemon selected for that Tuesday. From there, players can start catching the Pokemon and earning whatever rewards there are for that days event. Below is the spotlight schedule for December, along with the Pokemon and rewards that will be included during the hour long event:

 <ul>
  <li>
   December 3 - Sableye, double catch stardust
  </li>
  <li>
   December 10 - Murkrow, double catch XP
  </li>
  <li>
   December 17 - Slugma/Bergmite, double catch candy
  </li>
  <li>
   December 24 - Delibird, double transfer candy
  </li>
  <li>
   December 31 - Togetic, double evolution XP
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1106} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The Pokemon that have been selected for this month's spotlight hours are good choices, considering many of them are Pokemon that we mainly see spawning in the winter - with Togetic being a Pokemon that is often item featured in holiday events.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":243} -->
 <p>
  All the Pokemon listed above are also available in a Shiny variant. This means that while the Spotlight Hours are happening, players will have an increased chance of catching one since the spawn rates have already increased. This is another big upside to playing in the spotlight hours outside of the standard rewards.

 <p>
  The Spotlight Hours change every month with different Pokemon, so be sure to check back next month for our January 2025 Spotlight Hour schedule, which will cover what to expect in terms of the Pokemon and rewards each Tuesday. That is everything we know about the spotlight schedule for December so far.

  The
  <em>
   Shadow Fight
  </em>
  games are certainly some of the best representatives of the Fighting genre on mobile devices, as the third part combines all the best features from previous games. As a result, players have access to extensive customization of weapons and equipment, which significantly affects the gameplay. To get more equipment fast, you can use
  <strong>
   <em>

  As befits the genre, in
  <em>
   Shadow Fight 3,
  </em>
  your victory mainly depends on your skills and knowledge of combos. But often, you will encounter enemies who can reduce your health bar in two hits. In this case, you need to upgrade your equipment or find a new one. This requires various resources and currencies, which, fortunately, can be obtained using
  <em>
   Shadow Fight 3
  </em>
  Codes.

      <title>Fortnite: All Chapter 6 Season 1 Accolades</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/fortnite-complete-accolades-list/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Accolades have been in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  for a few years now, but a few seasons ago, Epic Games decided that it wanted fans to take them more seriously than ever. Before, gamers would be rewarded XP for completing certain Accolades, but unless they memorized them after getting them for the first time, there was no way of knowing what they had to do to unlock them.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":357} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  This is why an Accolades collection was added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , allowing players to check them at any time they'd like. This feature incentivizes fans to try to complete all Accolades available and acquire them as many times as possible so they can compare their stats with their friends near the end of the season.

  There are
  <strong>
   171 Accolades to unlock in
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   Chapter 6 Season 1
  </strong>
  . Accolades work like in-game achievements, and players will naturally unlock most of them simply by playing
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale. However, some of them require gamers to do specific tasks in-game, and they won't be able to get them unless they check out the Accolades list in the Collection tab.
  <strong>
   The Collection tab can be found in the Quests menu, which can be accessed while in the lobby
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  <strong>
   Players should make a note of the Accolades they'd like to unlock and then play a match following its exact requirements
  </strong>
  . For example, the "Knife to a Gun Fight" Accolade can only be obtained if the player wins a match only dealing damage with melee weapons - doing this by chance is nearly impossible.

  Before you attempt to use the Mystery Egg in
  <em>
   Super Mario RPG
  </em>
  , you will first need to make sure you have the item in your inventory. If you don't have one, the only place where the item can be purchased is from the
  <strong>
   treasure-hunting Toad in Moleville
  </strong>
  . Specifically, you'll want to visit the
  <strong>
   Item Shop
  </strong>
  in the town, which can be found on the western side, just below the Fireworks Shop.

  After you've obtained the Mystery Egg, the only way you can utilize it is by equipping Peach with the

   Nurture Ring

   Marrymore Hotel Shop

  You'll need to give the Nurture Ring to Peach and have her equip it. While in battle, you'll want to have Peach
  <strong>
   use the Mystery Egg 10 times
  </strong>
  . When it is her turn in battle, just choose Item, and then click the Mystery Egg. Eventually, you'll receive the Lamb's Lure as a reward, and a message will pop up on the screen:

 <p>
  With the Lamb's Lure now in your inventory, you might be wondering what exactly it can be used for. It's a pretty simple item that can easily get you out of battles against low-level enemies (and occasionally more powerful enemies in later regions). When in battle, go to your Items, and choose the Lamb's Lure and use it against an enemy. There's a high chance they will
  <strong>
   instantly turn into a lamb
  </strong>
  and get taken away.

 <p>
  However, keep in mind that when you use this item, you will not get any coins or experience afterward. So, this item is
  <strong>
   mostly to be used to avoid unexpected battles with weaker enemies
  </strong>
  that won't yield much of a reward anyway.

      <title>LEGO's Leaked James Bond Game Explained</title>

 <p>
  The Traveler's Tales era of
  <strong>
   LEGO
  </strong>
  videogames had a stranglehold over thousands of childhoods, with dozens of IPs being rendered in its classic formula. Recently, a new discovery has been made about one of TT's scrapped LEGO titles, one that's been known in fan circles for some time.

 <p>
  With games like
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  not quite meeting expectations, the longing for more classic-era LEGO games is more than apparent. Given that TT's loss of exclusivity over LEGO games coincided with allegations of crunch conditions at the studio, it's likely for the best that LEGO moved on from it—but the company's games still have draws worth keeping. A winning collectathon formula, decent narratives, memorable gags, and a style of animation and humor distinct from the
  <em>
   LEGO Movie
  </em>
  style pursued by something like
  <em>
   Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Interestingly, there are a number of TT LEGO projects that never made the light of day. After the success of 2005's
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars
  </em>
  , which immediately cemented the LEGO game formula, the company made a few test animations to pitch some more LEGO game ideas. These pitch videos were released by Jon Burton, former director of TT games, on the YouTube channel GameHut. Included were never-before-seen test clips for a James Bond game and a
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  game, neither of which saw the light of day beyond this test; not only did LEGO find these IPs too dark, but they both lacked a toyline backing.

 <p>
  However, a new discovery has been made about the former pitch, which is a leaked LEGO James Bond trailer. The footage was reportedly found within a build of
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  , a toys-to-life LEGO game that saw a number of IPs crossing over via the multiverse. The game includes a number of IPs that are yet to receive standalone LEGO sets (such as
  <em>
   Gremlins
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Goonies
  </em>
  ), so James Bond would've fit right in (even though there are now some LEGO sets based on his Aston Martin car). The question of this trailer's legitimacy, as well as whether it plays into the original 2005 pitch, is hotly debated.

  The Leaked LEGO James Bond Trailer Looks Real, But Not Like The 2005 Pitch
 </h3>
 <p>
  The leaked trailer is a dead ringer for a LEGO Traveler's Tales game. While there's nothing to confirm its legitimacy, though the copyright takedowns of the leak do suggest that somewhat, the humor and animation are spot on. Gags such as insertions of a LEGO pig, skeleton minifigures shown during electrocution, comical takes on famous scenes, and kid-friendly interpretations of violent moments are all TT hallmarks.

 <p>
  However, it's unlikely that this lines up with the original LEGO James Bond pitch from 2005. The animation style, the look of the minifigures, and the overall fidelity (as well as the fact that characters can speak) are more indicative of the TT style that came about post-2012, following on from games like
  <em>
   LEGO Batman 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   LEGO Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  . The question is then whether the footage is from scrapped
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  content or a scrapped standalone game. Both are possible, but there's some credence to it being a
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  expansion. Not only did
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  bring in more mature IP, but its inclusion of Doctor Who allowed the player to switch between versions of the Doctor, a system that would map very well onto James Bond.

 <p>
  Given the conception of a game like
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  , a James Bond LEGO game today isn't impossible. In fact, the circumstances for making the latter would be very similar to LEGO's most recent video game effort. However, there's little to no chance that a full version of what was teased in these leaks (or in the 2005 pitch) will ever come to fruition, especially now TT has seemingly moved on from LEGO.

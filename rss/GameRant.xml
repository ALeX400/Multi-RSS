  <strong>
   Q: When you released the original
   <em>
    Journey to Un'Goro
   </em>
   expansion, did you know then you would be returning to Un'Goro? If not, when did that decision get made?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Short answer, no. Very few of us on card design - although there are a couple - were actually on card design when
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  was being made. But several of us have been players for a very, very long time, and we loved
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro.
  </em>
  I mean, when
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  came out, Quests were one of the greatest, most exciting things that
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  had ever done
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  And so, it was always a set that we remember very fondly, and we knew that the players really loved it as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Something that we had been discussing for a couple of years amongst the team was the Tortollans, which are a race that was actually made by the
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  team when they made
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro.
  </em>
  I just thought it was so fascinating how they had been adopted into
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  and made canon. But the
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  team had been the ones to bring them into the world first, and we had told a little bit of their story in the Un'Goro Crater, but we had never really explored what their backstory was - not in
  <em>
   Hearthstone,
  </em>
  at least.
 </p>
 <p>
  When we were making
  <em>
   Perils in Paradise,
  </em>
  we thought maybe for that mini-set, wouldn't it be kind of fun if we explored the Tortollans' backstory? Maybe the island that Marin purchased used to be the island home of a Tortollan civilization? But the more we started unwrapping layers there, the more we started talking about it, the more we realized, "Hey, there's more story here than we wanted to put in a mini set. There's more than 35 cards' worth of story."
 </p>
 <p>
  When it came time to pitch for Expansion 33, which is
  <em>
   The Lost City of Un'Goro -
  </em>
  I love adventure stories and exploration, the traditional "Lost City of El Dorado" story. It's iconic and I thought it would be really fun to do the backstory of the Tortollans as a proper set. What better place to do it than back in Un'Goro Crater, where we met them for the first time - but to peel some layers back from that and say "Oh, everything that you thought you knew the first time? There was a lot more that was happening underneath."
 </p>
 <p>
  I don't know what the intention of the team was at the time, but there was a journal entry that we did as part of marketing that came from these two characters. Their names were Professor Doyle and Eddie Malone, and [the journal] was telling their story as they went through the crater. They run into Elise [Starseeker] and Umbra and all the characters in the set, and they run into all the dangers and dinosaurs.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the passages from that journal entry said something along the lines of "Umbra took us to the base of Fire Mountain and said, 'Look up to see the truth.'" And we were like, what in the world could that possibly mean, other than there's a city in the volcano in the middle of the Un'Goro Crater?
 </p>
 <p>
  So I like to think that maybe they had planned for something to be in there all along. I, of course, don't know that that was the case, but I think it actually worked out pretty beautifully that we were able to say, "Oh, there's actually a precedent for there being something going on there." Let's tell you what's going on there. Let's explore that story, and let's get to tell that story in the Un'Goro Crater with this environment and those dinosaurs and elementals that players love, but let's put the emphasis and the focus on the Tortollans this time.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Tying in with the focus on the Tortollans, we get Loh, a new Tortollan character introduced in the expansion. What can you tell us about Loh?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Loh is this incredible Tortollan adventurer. He's been spoken about in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft,
  </em>
  but he's never actually been seen. But they say that Tortollan parents tell their children stories of Loh's great adventures and of his heroism.
 </p>
 <p>
  And Loh, he's getting a little bit up there in years. Maybe he's four or five thousand Tortollan years old. They're very long-lived. And he's gone on all these incredible adventures, but he wants to have one more before he retires - before he hangs up his hat and gives up his life of adventuring.
 </p>
 <p>
  We're saying that, for a long time, the rumored Lost City of Un'Goro was kind of a fable among the Tortollans, something that has been passed down through generations and generations. A lot of Tortollans just thought it was a story, but Loh was determined to prove that the Lost City does exist. And he thought - what better way to write his last story than to prove the existence of the Lost City, to find it himself, and then to write that story and go off into retirement?
 </p>
 <p>
  So he reaches out to Elise Starseeker, whom he knew, of course, from the Explorers' Guild. She's very famous. He knew that she had gone to the Un'Goro crater the first time. He reaches out to Elise, and Elise is actually who puts him in contact with Niri, who's a gnome character who is new to this expansion. And then, Umbra, of course, the former leader of the Tortollans in the Un'Goro Crater.
 </p>
 <p>
  And that's sort of how their adventure begins. They come together in the crater, and they set off. Of course, we find out later on that Umbra has been hiding some nefarious plans of her own. She's maybe not as in the dark about the location of the Lost City as she appeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  You get that classic adventuring and exploration vibe that I think players would expect from
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro,
  </em>
  and we get to tell the story of our characters' adventures through the crater, finding the city, actually being able to enter the city and meet these Tortollans and find out about what their life in the crater is like through the story of the Quests we have in the set.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the 11 Quests all have different images that depict different moments in our players' adventure, all sort of culminating in the betrayal of Spiritsinger Umbra. Finding out that she's been working with the Cult of the Damned in the Crater, and that she's actually forcibly trying to take back her position as the chief of the Lost City. And now our heroes must have this big climactic finale where they band together with the Tortollans to try and defeat the evil Cult of the Damned.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's quite a jam-packed story. There's a lot that we're trying to get across. But it's been a really fun one to be able to tell.

  <strong>
   Q: When it comes to designing the 11 Quests, how do you keep them unique and connected to the classes, challenging but not impossible to achieve?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  So, Edward can speak about this from a game balance position, but I can speak about it from the initial creative development. Quests are hard. I think maybe we went in with a little bit of hubris, honestly, in saying we're going to do Quests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players love Quests. We love Quests. They're so much fun to play with. We've got lots of learnings from Quests and questlines of the past. We knew things that had gone really well, that players really liked. We also knew some things that maybe didn't work quite as well. So we said, we've got all of this information. Surely we can knock this out of the park. This should be great. But we still had a lot more learning ahead of us, you know? Just a lot of iteration throughout the design process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players are guaranteed to have the Quest in their opening hand, so a lot of players are playing these on Turn 1, which means they're very, very likely to complete the Quest throughout the game and get the Quest reward. It needs to feel like you're appropriately rewarded for building your deck to accomplish this goal, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  But if players are winning the game in the same exact way very consistently every time, it's maybe not as fun. There needs to be a little bit of nuance there. They can't outright win you the game, but they need to push you in that direction so you feel like you're accomplishing your goal, and that's a pretty fine line to ride.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think we did get to a point where we're very happy with the rewards that we have. Some of them are these moments in time. Some of them, if you build your deck in a very specific way, you can take advantage of and get more value out of them. Some are a little bit less powerful immediately, but they have power that lasts longer. And one of them is, I will say, quite a bit more unique than the others. We have yet to reveal it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going in, we just wanted to make sure that fun and gameplay experience were the priority here. Like I said, players are going to see these quests and be playing with these quests every game that they have them in their deck. So it needs to be a good experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, we made sure that there's a fair amount of novelty there. We want to guide players in a direction, but we don't want to say, "These are the 30 cards you need to put in your deck." We still want there to be some creativity, some options for them to express themselves through their deck building. And rewards that can really tell that story and make them feel rewarded for their gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  We didn't go with a specific structured style. For instance, in
  <em>
   Saviors of Uldum,
  </em>
  all the rewards were hero powers. We didn't go with that. This time, we said we want each of these individual rewards to be what they need to be. And that meant that some of them are minions. A couple of them are even weapons, which is really exciting. One of them is a minion that Deathrattles and gives you a location. So, we're making sure that they serve their individual specific purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  Cora did a great job on that explanation, but there's one thing that I strongly disagree with her about. She said, "One of these quests looks unique," and I don't know what she's talking about, because I think a lot of them are really unique.
  <em>
   [Laughs]
  </em>
  I actually don't know which one she's referring to.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  There are a couple that are a little weird. Good weird.

  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  I'd say quite a few of them. One thing that I'd also mention about this set is that, in a lot of places, we're trying to pay homage to the old
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  set. I think it's one of my favorite sets of all time. That's true for a lot of people on the team. It's true for quite a few of our players as well. I think
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  ranks as one of the most polished, best-designed sets ever in
  <em>
   Hearthstone.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of that, when we're talking about learnings that we're generating from Quests, we've been all over the place with Quests. There were the original ones in
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro,
  </em>
  and there were the hero power Quests in
  <em>
   Saviors of Uldum.
  </em>
  There were the, I would say, slightly maligned questlines from
  <em>
   United in Stormwind.
  </em>
  We definitely learned a lot from those.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the goals with this was, as Cora talked about, you want to pay off powerful rewards to players. I think the goal with a lot of these Quests is not to tell you how to win. It's like, "Here's a powerful thing. Now go figure out how to win with it," rather than "Here is the game plan that you're going to be doing for every single game, so go do it." I think that's true for both the inputs and the outputs. When we break down how we design Quests, there are two really important parts to it. Usually, players see the powerful reward and think that's the cool part. But I often think that the cool part is what we're encouraging you to do to get there, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were to look at questlines for a moment in time and say, "Hey, here's a learning," one of the questlines that I think we probably wouldn't do in the future was the Hunter questline [from
  <em>
   Reunited in Stormwind],
  </em>
  "Defend the Dwarven District." It was "Cast damage-dealing spells at enemies." And what you do with that style of deck is you put a bunch of removal spells in your deck, and you kill your opponent's stuff. And you don't really do much of your own game plan until you've got your quest reward. It's not very fun for the opposing player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, we've got something like "Spend 18 corpses" [for Death Knight]. The gameplay is you've got to play a bunch of minions. You've got to play a bunch of things that are spending corpses, right? It's much more back and forth with the other player.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think the Mage Quest and reward that we just revealed, where you're discovering cards, to get there every single game, is going to be wildly different because of the cards you're discovering, right? So, I think there was a lot of really good design sense in the original
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  rewards and how open-ended they were, that I think we applied really smartly to the Quests here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Yeah, one of my favorite Quests that we've revealed so far is Warrior. It's "Enter the Lost City." And the input simply says: "Survive ten turns." However you choose to do it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Likely, that will push you into a more control-oriented play style, because you need to remove your opponent's board. You need to heal to survive ten turns. But there are any number of ways you can build your deck to do it. So, I think it's interesting to have those kinds of inputs that make players think differently about how they want to approach that task.

  <strong>
   Q: There's so much in
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro -
   </em>
   Quests, Maps, Stories, the Kindred keyword, and all that lore. How do you keep it all balanced and make sure you can fit it all in?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Well, the short answer to it is, we have very talented people with lots of creative brainpower. We do this whole process at the beginning of expansions that we call "Blue Skies," which is where we do mechanic design, and that's really at the point where anything goes. We're going to throw every idea against the wall, and we're going to see what sticks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will say, with
  <em>
   The Lost City of Un'Goro,
  </em>
  since we are referencing
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro,
  </em>
  we had come in with a really strong foundation. We knew we wanted to do Quests. We knew our major mechanic for the set was going to be Quests. So what else did we need to make it so that this set feels robust and full of life and also like its own unique entity, like it's not just a rehashing of
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro?
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  That's where Kindred comes in, and where Maps and Stories come in. In some cases, they're referential to
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro
  </em>
  , but also have their own unique new identity to them. Kindred is very reminiscent of the elementals, which were released for the first time in
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro.
  </em>
  But, notably, we opened it up so that it is every minion type and every spell school.
 </p>
 <p>
  They're going to play in different ways. Players are going to have to choose - how many of each individual minion type or spell school do I want to have in my deck to ensure that I can get that bonus? We also made the card "Torga," which draws you a Kindred card and another card that can satisfy the Kindred condition for it. So, you know, if you want to just play a Kindred card and another card in your deck you, in theory, could do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  We tried to give you a little bit of help there, but if you aren't strategic about your planning to make sure that you can satisfy that condition, it can be a little difficult to use. But, in testing, we found it also feels really rewarding when you can kind of lay out that game plan and then execute on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  Like with Quests, one thing that I really like about Kindred is, not only does it tell the story of the setting of Un'Goro, where there are dinosaurs and elementals and all the various creatures and denizens of the land, I think it's also very open-ended. Like, how you construct your deck, how you play out your turns, encourages a lot of that thinking of "Oh, I have a really good play this turn, but maybe I want to save it to activate Kindred later?"

  <strong>
   Q: One of the things players loved about
   <em>
    Journey to Un'Goro
   </em>
   was the many dinosaurs that make their home in the crater. Can you tell us about what kinds of dinosaurs we might see in
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro?
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Oh, my goodness - every kind of dinosaur that we could possibly give to you. I like to joke that, over the last year, I've had the really fun job of just trying to make as many dinosaurs as possible. When we're going through the art and writing process, we ask, "What are all the dinosaurs that are canonically in the Un'Goro Crater?" And then, "Can we get away with putting some in this set that might not be there? Can we get away with making up a few new dinosaurs?"
 </p>
 <p>
  You're going to see lots of dinosaurs that you've seen before, but you might also see some dinosaurs that you haven't seen before in
  <em>
   Hearthstone.
  </em>
  Like the Platysaur, for instance, which is a very silly little quizzical-looking dinosaur duckbill, and is also a pretty powerful one-drop that we have in neutral for this set. So yeah, you're going to see Devilsaurs and Brutosaurs and Skyscreamers and all of them. Every dino under the sun.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: I love the Story you've shown off about Carnassa - her brood of devilsaurs are so adorable and so dangerous at the same time.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  You can't blame dinosaurs for their nature. Dinos be Dino-ing - and you know what? If we're in their way - that's our fault.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  Yeah, my favorite story about this set is because we've already been to Un'Goro, and sometimes, when we do mechanics, we always try to find the twist. Like Kindred being a twist on elementals. Opening up new space. So one thing I talked to the team about was, "Hey, they had big dinosaurs in
  <em>
   Journey to Un'Goro.
  </em>
  We've got to come up with some big dinosaurs."
 </p>
 <p>
  The team came back with some stuff, and it wasn't big enough. We had to come up with even bigger dinosaurs. So there was this hour-long conversation and at the end of it it's like "Screw it. Ultragigasaur. It's the biggest, baddest dinosaur we could ever make."
  <em>
   [Laughs]
  </em>
  I don't know what will happen 10 years from now when they go, "Okay, we need to go even bigger with the dinosaurs."
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  I do think our most positive reception so far to any revealed card is to Ultragigasaur. 11 mana, 14/28, no text box, literally unplayable unless you have a coin, or you've ramped over 10 mana, which we have given you a couple of ways to do. Universally, we love the big dinos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Overall, what has the fan response been like to
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro
   </em>
   and the cards you have revealed so far?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  I think they're so excited. And I think there's a lot of responsibility that comes with revisiting such a fan-favorite location and environment, because [the players] remember it so fondly. So, on the one hand, they're so excited to go back and get to potentially relive some of that nostalgia and joy.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, on the other hand, it's like - we really can't mess this up, right? This is pretty big. We want to give them more of what they love and not ruin it for them. So, we hopefully approached it with a very loving touch. Players do seem very excited so far to be able to go back. And, so far, they're really responding well to the art and the story and the worldbuilding that we're doing, which is great. It's always wonderful to see that positive response.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Recently, with the addition of content such as
   <em>
    Hearthstone Arena,
   </em>
   there have been a lot of newer players getting into
   <em>
    Hearthstone.
   </em>
   What advice would you give to newer players regarding playing with
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro
   </em>
   expansion?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  I think, just from a deck-building perspective, Quests are probably going to take a lot of iteration. I'd really encourage you to experiment and explore the different options that you have. Try to figure out a mana curve that you have for your deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure that, for example, if you're doing the "Discover eight cards" Quest, you have enough Discover cards in your deck. We've designed these Quests specifically so that you can, pretty consistently, if you're really trying, get that Quest reward and play with it. So yeah, I would really just look at deck building and experimenting with how that plays out.

  <strong>
   Q: In addition to all the new and returning mechanics,
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro
   </em>
   is such a narrative-rich expansion. What was it like blending in all that narrative, and what strategies did you use to do that?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  Every designer has a different design process and a different philosophy. I find that there are several of us who actually work really well from a top-down perspective. We have a story, we have a flavor that we're trying to achieve. How, mechanically, can we reflect that story in gameplay?
 </p>
 <p>
  From that perspective, it was really important to us to have the story of all our classes be the story of our adventure. The identity of what each individual class is doing. Each individual class in the set does have the theming of what the Tortollans, who are native to the Un'Goro Crater, do to basically protect the sanctity of the Titans' experiments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Un'Goro was created as a hotbed for Titan experimentation. And so, in the absence of the Titans, the Watcher Nablya has been tasked with the role of continuing to maintain the sanctity of these experiments. Eonar created the Crater, and Freya was involved, and now Nablya is the Watcher. The Tortollans work with Nablya, and so each class of Tortollans has different jobs and different roles in the Crater.
 </p>
 <p>
  We made sure, before we went into archetype design, that we knew what each class's Tortollan job was, and then we were able to reflect that in archetype design. For instance, the Warriors are the sentries and guards of the city. And I think that you can see some of that flavor through some of the cards that we have revealed so far. The Mages, which we just revealed some major cards recently, are the archaeologists and keepers of knowledge - the librarians, the bookkeepers, things like that.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, we had that foundation of story to guide design, and then also having some really wonderful narrative experts - and, of course, access to the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  team and their lore experts who are infinitely knowledgeable. This meant that we had all the right pieces to be able to put together, hopefully, a really cool puzzle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  A good narrative helps a ton with design, as well. It usually gets you to places where you say, "Oh, that's really exciting. We gotta tell that story." And, if we do tell that story, this other thing comes to mind as well, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  But also, there are lots of players playing
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  who might not engage with a story on that level. You might just be playing on your phone on a train while you're waiting for it to arrive. And, for that group of players, we still need to make sure that, when they come to
  <em>
   The Lost City of Un'Goro,
  </em>
  they're having a good time, and they feel immersed in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  And there's a lot of opportunities to do that in the set, especially with Quests. Cora talked earlier about how each of these individual Quests are part of an overall story, but all of those little pieces are still stories in their own right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like, in "Reanimate the Terror," the Death Knight Quest, talking top down - or bottom up - you're resurrecting this giant undead dinosaur to do your evil bidding. And how do you do it? Oh, you've got to spend corpses, obviously. So what's cool about that is, in the game, naturally, the deck that you're going to be playing and the strategies that you're going to pursue feed directly into the story that we're trying to tell. So I love when we get that chance of the narrative matching the gameplay and making sense, even for players who might not be as in-tune with the overall lore of
  <em>
   Hearthstone.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What is your favorite card in
   <em>
    The Lost City of Un'Goro?
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  I will say a card that I'm very, very proud of, that people put a lot of time and effort into, is the Warlock Quest, which we have not revealed yet. That reward took a lot of work and time and effort, and I think it's really, really cool. So I'm very proud of that one. Also, the Rogue Quest - I love its theming, and, hopefully, it's one that Rogue players will really like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Goodwin:
  </strong>
  I have two answers. I love the Death Knight Quest, just from a gameplay mechanic perspective. And then, as a designer, where I'm thinking about simplicity and elegance and all that kind of stuff, the Hunter Quest we've got this time around is a really great one that evokes a lot of that old
  <em>
   Un'Goro
  </em>
  feeling while still feeling totally fresh and new. So I'm looking forward to when we reveal that one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Georgiou:
  </strong>
  I remember when we were playtesting [the Hunter quest], and it just wasn't quite there. And somebody just made a suggestion at that moment, and we were like, "Aha, that'll do it." And when you have those moments, it's a really satisfying experience. So that one was definitely a team effort, and it's really wonderful.
 </p>

  Hope you’ve been enjoying the Rebel Racers minigame. The races officially kicked off on June 12, and players will be going head-to-head with other teams in three rounds. If you and your squad manage to win, you’ll walk away with many great rewards like the Wild Sticker, a 5-star sticker pack, and more.

  The Rebel Racers minigame runs until June 15. If you’ve been playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  for a while, you probably know that it’s pretty common to have a few tokens left when these events end. So what happens to your leftover Flags once Rebel Racers is over? Let’s find out.

 <p>
  Once the Rebel Racers event ends, everything tied to it goes away, including your Flag tokens. But don’t worry because your tokens won’t just vanish.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly G
   </em>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   O will automatically swap your leftover Flags for cash.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The exact amount depends on how far along you are in the game. Basically, the higher your board level or net worth, the more money you will get per token. So the Flags don’t carry over to future events, but players will at least get some extra cash to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cash is not too hard to get in the board game, so it would be a good idea to use your Flag tokens while the Rebel Racers event is still live. There are lap rewards along the way, and if you stick with it, you could even earn the Wild Sticker, a five-star sticker pack, and different skins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Money is mainly used to upgrade your buildings. Every board has a set of buildings that you need to level up multiple times before you can move on to the next one. And as you upgrade, your net worth increases too.

 <p>
  There’s still a bit of time left in the Rebel Racers event, so if you need more Flag Tokens, make sure to join the solo event and tournament. The Wampa Stash event is live and gives you up to
  <strong>
   2,630 Flags
  </strong>
  if you finish all the milestones. The Snowtrooper Sprint tournament is also available, which offers another
  <strong>
   2,160 Flag Tokens
  </strong>
  .

      <title>Kingdom Hearts 4 May Have the Perfect Recipe for a Successor to Dream Drop Distance</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/kingdom-hearts-4-dream-drop-distance-successor-playable-sora-yozora/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  focused on closing many of the open plot threads from the Xehanort saga, its DLC and secret ending offered a glimpse at something very different. With
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  now confirmed to be “the beginning of the end,” one mystery stands out: Yozora. Once believed to be little more than a meta nod to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Versus 13
  </em>
  , Yozora has since become a pillar in the evolving
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  mythos. His presence in Quadratum, a world that will serve as the next game’s setting, signals a major shift.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->

 <p>
  This shift is not just about characters. It is also about gameplay. If
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  adopts a dual protagonist structure similar to
  <em>
   Dream Drop Distance
  </em>
  , it may finally redeem one of the series' most divisive mechanics. A split narrative could work better this time, especially if Sora and Yozora offer distinct perspectives, combat styles, and narrative weight.

  A dual protagonist system in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  could serve as a natural evolution of what
  <em>
   Dream Drop Distance
  </em>
  tried to accomplish. In that entry, players switched between Sora and Riku, but the Drop mechanic disrupted the pacing. Despite this, the concept of experiencing two different viewpoints proved valuable. A modern implementation, especially one not tied to timers, could deepen the story without interfering with the gameplay flow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yozora and Sora are already foils. Sora acts on emotion and heart, while Yozora’s world is one of realism, duty, and skepticism. The setting of Quadratum, described by Nomura as a world that looks like reality but is not quite real, gives both characters room to explore their identities. Allowing players to switch between the two, either through chapters or player choice, could provide a full picture of what is at stake in both worlds.

     In

     </em>
     , defeating Yozora leads to one ending, while losing to him leads to another. Both may be canon. This makes him one of the only characters in the series to influence the timeline through player outcome.

  Verum Rex Could Offer Gameplay Innovation
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  embraces the dual protagonist structure, the Verum Rex gameplay hinted at in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  ’s Toy Box world could become reality. The in-universe trailer showed Yozora in high-speed, high-tech combat. If that same style is carried into the actual game, Yozora’s gameplay could be radically different from Sora’s traditional Keyblade mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yozora in
  <em>
   KH4
  </em>
  might rely on ranged weapons, teleportation, and gadgets. These are tools far removed from Sora’s magic and melee focus. This would not just give players variety. It would also let each character represent different genres. Sora would be rooted in action RPG tradition, and Yozora would explore systems more similar to modern character-action games.
 </p>
 <p>
  This contrast can enrich the series’ identity rather than dilute it. It gives players two styles to master, and a chance to see how each approach fits into the evolving rules of Kingdom Hearts’ metaphysical universe.

    <p>
     The original Verum Rex trailer pays homage to cut footage from
     <em>
      Final Fantasy Versus 13
     </em>
     , including urban combat, hovering gunships, and a cryptic tone. This makes Verum Rex not just an in-joke but a thematic continuation.

 <h3 id="future-games-could-expand-this-narrative-style">
  Future Games Could Expand This Narrative Style
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  succeeds with two playable characters, future entries could expand the concept even further. Nomura has expressed interest in completing the current saga before retirement, and a multi-protagonist structure may be his way of tying up multiple story arcs at once. Characters like Riku, Kairi, and even newer faces like Strelitzia could rotate into the spotlight, each bringing their own playable style and narrative lens.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than that, this shift allows
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  to feel like it is growing up. Where early titles centered entirely on Sora’s point of view, the next era seems focused on interweaving multiple fates. By showing how different characters perceive the same events or conflicts, the game can build stronger emotional stakes and avoid overexposing any one character.

      <title>Grand Theft Auto Fans Think GTA 6's Lucia and Jason Look A Lot Like Red Dead Redemption 2 Characters</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  fans are acknowledging similarities between Lucia and Jason, the upcoming Rockstar Game's protagonists, and Mary and Arthur from
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . A short video shared by a fan shows some similarities between the two, not only in their appearances, but some of their actions over the course of the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  trailer and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  gameplay.

 <p>
  A lot of game characters have come and gone over the course of Rockstar Games' history, but it's safe to say that few have impacted players quite like those in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . Arthur Morgan's adventure throughout the course of the game is not only extremely impressive visually, with some of Rockstar's best graphics to date, but also heartfelt, exciting, and moving. As the most recent title from Rockstar, it's no surprise that players are comparing it with the next game coming from the studio.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Reddit, user kuttekabaccha has shared a brief video comparing side-by-side footage of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  's latest trailer and gameplay from
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , showcasing some similarities between the characters of both and moments in their stories. It opens with
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's Lucia leaving prison and meeting Jason, while Mary opens the door and discovers Arthur standing on her doorstep. The video then moves on to a shot of Lucia and Jason drinking together while Mary and Arthur have a chat, with Arthur sporting a more similar haircut to Jason in the shot. Rounding it out are a pair of shots, one with Mary and Lucia dragging their male counterparts out of bars, while a final clip shows Jason and Arthur eyeing the ladies as they do a little twirl.

  Grand Theft Auto 6 and Red Dead Redemption 2 Similarities Get Fans Worried
 </h2>
 <p>
  Numerous users have responded to the post, with some acknowledging that there are some resemblances between the moments, as well as the characters. Others have gotten a bit misty-eyed thinking about Mary and Arthur, which has led some to worry about the fate of Jason and Lucia.
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  stories don't always have happy endings for the protagonists, particularly with
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  having different endings depending on one's actions, with some seriously negative potential outcomes.
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  may very well have one of the most tragic stories in the history of Rockstar Games, adding more fuel to these concerns.

  , fans won't know for a while yet if there are more similarities between these two pairs, or the games in general. As fans keep poring over the brief footage shown of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  so far, though, there may be more discoveries and commonalities discovered.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  With only a few cities currently available and one more on the horizon,
  <strong>
   <em>
    InZOI
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s approach to world-building has already struck a balance between realism and stylized cultural homage. The game’s existing cities, Dowon and Bliss Bay, offer a promising start, capturing the rhythms of metropolitan and beachside life with flair, but life-sim games always have room for more. Now that
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  has proven it can nail atmosphere and aesthetics, the question is where the game will take players next.
 </p>

  As Kucingku prepares to debut with its tropical, Indonesia-inspired vibes, players are already dreaming of future neighborhoods their Zois might one day call home. From bustling international capitals to beach towns dripping in historical charm, here’s a curated list of dream cities perfect for
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  ’s ever-expanding world.

  So far, there are only two playable cities in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  . Described as “parallel universes,” these cities offer different lots, unique career paths, and vibes for a Zoi to enjoy. Whether it’s the bustling streets of one city or the serene parks of the other, every aspect of these environments adds depth and excitement to the game.
 </p>
 <h3 id="dowon">
  Dowon
 </h3>
 <p>
  Dowon captures the vibrant pulse of South Korea’s metropolises. A cosmopolitan blend of high-tech ambition and traditional roots, it provides players with the kind of kinetic, stylish setting that mirrors cities like Seoul. Dowon’s cityscape is perfect for Zois created with a Pro-Gamer or Idol career in mind.
 </p>
 <h3 id="bliss-bay">
  Bliss Bay
 </h3>
 <p>
  A sun-soaked boardwalk city inspired by the U.S. West Coast, Bliss Bay exudes coastal charm. With strong Santa Monica or Santa Cruz energy, it’s perfect for players who dream of beach volleyball, artisan coffee, and amusement park fun at Bliss Bay. It’s a laid-back haven that contrasts sharply with the urban buzz of Dowon.
 </p>
 <h3 id="kucingku">
  Kucingku
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although still unreleased, Kucingku is confirmed to be influenced by Indonesian culture. As the first free DLC city at
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , it will offer a more tropical destination. While little is known beyond its inspiration, players can likely expect lush landscapes, distinctive architecture, and a climate that is ripe for adventure. Players hope for jungle-adjacent suburbs, vibrant local markets, and spicy culinary delights for their Zois to relish in.

  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  has already proven its potential as a next-generation life-simulator, and its cities have been crucial to that success. With every new map, the game has the opportunity not only to diversify its aesthetics but also to deepen gameplay, adding new careers for Zois, lifestyles, architecture, and social dynamics. Expanding the city roster with globally inspired locales like San Juan, Tokyo, or Cape Town would only cement its legacy as a life-sim with ambition, range, and drive.
 </p>
 <h3 id="san-juan">
  San Juan
 </h3>
 <p>
  Few cities blend old-world charm and modern vibrancy like San Juan, Puerto Rico. The cobblestone streets and pastel-hued buildings of Old San Juan could provide the
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  map a canvas bursting with color, character, and nightlife potential.
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  ’s Willow Creek gave a soft nod to Southern Gothic aesthetics inspired by New Orleans flair, but a San Juan-inspired city could be a worthy competitor to Willow Creek with its Spanish Colonial architecture, coastal breezes, and rooftop salsa bars. Players can enjoy days-long festivals such as those at Calle San Sebastian in January, year-round oceanfront promenades, and a community as warm as the weather.
 </p>
 <h3 id="new-york-city">
  New York City
 </h3>
 <p>
  An obvious pick, sure—but for good reason.
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  ’s driving mechanics already place it a step ahead of many life-sims, and there would be no better way to flex that feature than by throwing Zois into the stressful gridlocked chaos of a New York–esque metropolis. This city would also cater to Zois chasing ambition: aspiring actors, business moguls, and underground artists. The nightlife would be legendary. The apartments would be microscopic. In other words, perfection.
 </p>
 <h3 id="london">
  London
 </h3>
 <p>
  With its layered history, diverse neighborhoods, and iconic transit system, a London-inspired map is a ready-made map waiting to happen.
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  could draw inspiration from the city’s charming row houses, corner shops, art galleries, and rainy sidewalks. There's also an opportunity for unique Zoi professions, such as curator, soccer player (or football player), pub owner, or Parliament staffer. A London-inspired town would be perfect for weaving in seasonal events like the Notting Hill Carnival or Guy Fawkes Night. London would offer a mature, lived-in contrast for players constantly chasing the high of the mid-2010s London media craze, perfectly immortalized in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  with selfie-perfect picture locations.

 <h3 id="cape-town">
  Cape Town
 </h3>
 <p>
  With its stunning natural backdrop and rich cultural heritage, Cape Town would be a gorgeous and distinctive inspiration for an addition to
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  ’s list of cities. From colorful Bo-Kaap homes to cafes overlooking Table Mountain, this city could blend art and music into a truly unique Zoi lifestyle. Additionally, local events such as open-air markets and film festivals would provide new social opportunities and gameplay loops.
 </p>
 <h3 id="tokyo">
  Tokyo
 </h3>
 <p>
  For a city bursting with inspiration, Tokyo is a no-brainer.
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  already has Dowon as an East Asian urban hub, but Tokyo’s specific identity—futuristic yet deeply traditional, chaotic yet orderly—could stand on its own as a muse for Krafton. Picture vending-machine cafes, capsule hotels, public baths, cherry blossom festivals, and subculture-packed districts. Tokyo would be ideal for Zois who live fast, collect hobbies like they're loot, and thrive in sensory overload.
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  drew inspiration from Japanese culture with Mt. Komorebi, so it would only be natural for
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  to also try their shot.

  Even with only two active cities,
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  developer Krafton has a lot on its plate. However, if it hopes to address player retention concerns for
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , it should explore all avenues to ensure interest in one of the emerging
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  competitors returns in full swing. Some other cities Krafton could add to
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Copenhagen
   </strong>
   – A Copenhagen-inspired city would feature clean designs, bikes everywhere, and the happiest Zois on Earth.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Rio de Janeiro
   </strong>
   – Carnival season, beachside samba, and lush mountaintop neighborhoods would make this city a certified Zoi favorite.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Istanbul
   </strong>
   – Where East meets West would be a perfect city for rich storytelling and contrasting lifestyles.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Vancouver
   </strong>
   – A nature-forward, tech-savvy Pacific Northwest hub where Zois can retreat from the hustle and bustle of other cities
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mexico City
   </strong>
   – Similar to the historic appeal of Old San Juan, a Mexico City location in
   <em>
    InZOI
   </em>
   could immerse Zois in a piece of digitally crafted history that boasts a healthy dose of beauty.
  </li>

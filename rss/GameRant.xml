      <title>8 JRPGs With The Most Jobs, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/jrpgs-with-most-jobs/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Players love JRPGs with a lot of gameplay variety, letting them try out new techniques and builds without too many problems. This is why the job mechanic is so popular in these games and compels many people to try out as many roles for their characters as possible.

 <p>
  While players may run out of jobs to max out in most JRPGs, some games take huge strides in ensuring that players can enjoy a wealth of unique classes to mess around with. It's downright challenging to focus on every job in these titles, which is why some players would prefer to just stick to a few choice roles that they can rely on.

  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  is one of the best JRPG sequels of all time, addressing some issues with the story and gameplay that some fans had from the first game. With more options in combat coupled with a satisfying conclusion, players will have a great time messing around with its robust job system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players start with eight pre-assigned jobs and slowly find locations throughout the map where they can find multiple licenses for these roles to use with other characters. To make this choice more challenging, four additional jobs are unlocked later down the line, which is very powerful and should be prioritized by players who want to make the most of
  <em>

  </em>
  's combat system.

  is one of the few games in the series that decided to put the story on the back burner and focus more on a job system that was as complex as ever. This is why the title is perfect for players who want to mess around with a job system that is detailed and satisfying.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a shame that the Advance version of this game is harder to find since it boasts even more jobs for players to master. However, as things stand, the

 <p>
  One of the many highlights of

  It's a shame that the

   Golden Sun
  </em>
  series has stagnated after the release of
  <em>
   Dark Dawn
  </em>
  since it's clear that there's a ton of potential for this franchise to evolve. The unique job system is a huge part of what makes the
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  games special, with the DS entry boasting the most number of jobs players could uncover.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gamers had to find numerous djinns and assign them to different party members to unlock powerful jobs that could decimate most enemies in style. Every job had a tier, further incentivizing players to find as many of these powerful creatures as possible to improve a party member's class and make them positively deadly in battle.

  With the hit success of

   Disco Elysium is one of the most deep and thought-provoking RPGs players can get their hands on. The sublime writing adds a ton of flavor to every conversation in the game, with an overarching murder mystery that ends on a satisfying note. Exploring Revachol is a task that players can get lost in for hours, with the amnesiac protagonist acquiring numerous interesting thoughts along the way that he can peruse for certain benefits. Some of Disco Elysium's best thoughts should be unlocked if players want the detective to be as competent as possible across a host of important skill checks.

 <p>
  Kim Kitsuragi is a partner who will slowly become one of the best characters in
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  . Despite having his doubts about the detective in charge of the case, players will win him over unless they screw up considerably. One of the many ways to increase one's relationship with Kim is to focus on some of
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  's best thoughts that help move this relationship in a positive direction, with Ace's Low being a great example of the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  After players cut down the body from the Hanged Tree and slap it with a decent investment in Interlacing, the detective can ponder upon the Ace's Low thought to enjoy an increase in Espirit de Corps while deepening their relationship with Kim Kitsuragi. It's a great thought that players can unlock early on to reap its benefits.

  Any thought that permanently increases one of the main character's stats is something that players should prioritize if they want to enjoy a higher chance of succeeding in most skill checks. This is why Hardcore Aesthetic is such a valuable thought, although unlocking it isn't exactly straightforward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players must find Noid in the church and speak to him about true life. This triggers a Conceptualization check that, once passed, lets Harry ponder this thought. The increase in Volition and Endurance is much appreciated and helps the player make the most of one of
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  's best thoughts.

  As a detective, one of the most common tasks assigned to these members of the police force is inquiring about missing persons. This is something that Harry and Kim are no strangers to, since they must inquire about certain people across Revachol and bring up this topic with specific characters to make progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who diligently ask pertinent characters in the game about these missing persons can unlock one of
  <em>
   Disco Elysium

  's best thoughts. There's no penalty involved in investing Harry's brain power into developing Searchlight Division, rewarding him with a much-welcome bonus in the Perception stat for all his hard work.

  Harry can perform some weird acts while investigating the murder case in Revachol. No sane man would devote so much time thinking about the random smells they experienced while checking out a card in a hidden compartment in a ledger or a random gum wrapper they happen upon, but this odd behavior is precisely why players love this character to kingdom come.
 </p>
 <p>
  One can argue that one of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Disco Elysium
   </em>
   's best thoughts
  </strong>
  is locked behind these two random actions, with Harry spending a few hours thinking about the scents he experienced. This eventually leads to a bonus in Perception that can help players attain a positive result in one of the many skills checks that take place in the game.

  The church is one of the most captivating locations to explore in
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  , housing a string of memorable interactions that will make players fall in love with this title for the umpteenth time. After investigating the void of sound in the church, players can talk about the same with Soona to unlock one of the
  <strong>
   best Thoughts in
   <em>

  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Cleaning out the Rooms is an excellent Thought that players should invest in, especially given the numerous benefits players can enjoy after riding this string of consciousness to the very end. Suggestion, Inland Empire, and Rhetoric are three of the most interesting skills in the game, and developing all three of them in one go is rewarding for obvious reasons.

  Kim Kitsuragi is the perfect foil to Harry's insanity, with his grounded responses and open-mindedness ensuring that the player can speak at length about some of the stupidest and most entertaining things that go through the amnesiac detective's heads without being shut down. One such instance comes when players fail a Conceptualization check and call themselves Raphael Ambrosius Costeau, sticking to their guns even after learning their true name's initials.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is this a hilarious way to establish a bond between Harry and Kim, but it also unlocks one of

  . Players will increase their Savoir Faire and Esprit de Corps skills by one point while also exploring the rich and funny writing that helped this game become one of the most notable CRPGs of the modern era.

 <p>
  Described as the opposite of Deja Vu, Jamais Vu is the concept of nothing seeming familiar at all. This thought grants players 1 XP for every orb clicked in the world and raises the learning cap of all blue (INT) skills by one. This may not sound like a huge bonus, but raising skill caps is always important, and getting constant XP for exploring the world is similarly important.
 </p>
 <p>
  It encourages players to explore with tangible rewards and lets one important skill check be passed with no effort. For integrating story seamlessly with gameplay, Jamais Vu is a great example of why
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  's Thought Cabinet should become an RPG staple.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Bringing of the Law is an interesting choice for players who embrace being a confident, authoritative cop. Thoughts that increase the learning caps for a player's major skills are worthwhile investments, in this case, Hand/Eye Coordination.
 </p>
 <p>
  The -1 penalty to Rhetoric is mild and can easily be offset by other items or Thoughts. Automatically succeeding at all Hand/Eye Coordination passives ensures that players will never miss any pertinent information regarding this skill. To unlock this Thought, players need to choose dialogue options that introduce Harry as a policeman/lawbringer.

 <p>
  Some may not want to commit to this thought as it means locking into the Moralist path expanded on in the Final Cut. However, it is undeniably useful in many situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  This thought heals players by one Morale point each time they choose a Moralist answer or response in dialogue, as well as raising the learning caps for Volition and Logic to five. Both of those are essential skills, and healing from dialogue means less spending on healing items later on.

 <p>
  Harry's problems in

  extend beyond just amnesia. Money (or lack thereof) is also a problem, at least in the early game. For players who like having plenty of cash on hand, embracing Ultraliberalism is the way to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  In dialogue, players should choose options that are pro-capitalist. Obtain money through any means necessary, including taking bribes whenever they're offered. When internalized, this Thought grants a little extra cash for every subsequent Ultraliberal dialogue option, which can add up to a nice sum over time.

  A useful alternative to the previous entry is Mazovian Socio-Economics. Players who shun capitalism and instead choose heavily communist dialogue options will eventually unlock this Thought. Although there are penalties to Visual Calculus and Authority, the bonus to XP gain will steadily pay for itself. Just be sure to always select heavily pro-working-class options in dialogue to get it.

  Not all-powerful Thoughts lock players into the Final Cut's political alignments. This one is instead tied to the Art Cop stereotype, so picking artistic answers or responses can speed up getting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once internalized, it gives -1 Hand/Eye Coordination, but in exchange, it heals one morale and gives 10 XP for every Conceptualization passive passed. That means players get bonus XP and healing just by reading dialogue, not even making choices. It's very powerful and relatively easy to unlock.

 <p>
  Rigorous Self-Critique turns failure into a positive. Every time Harry fails a red check in the categories above, he will heal either Health or Morale. Since failure is quite common in the game, having this Thought in one's back pocket isn't a bad idea. Players should apologize in dialogue every chance they get to unlock this Thought.

 </ul>
 <p>
  In the same vein as Actual Art Degree, this thought empowers Encyclopedia passives, making them give 10 XP and 2 Reál (
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  's currency). As long as one's Encyclopedia is relatively high, this will ensure players always have the money and XP they need on their own. Even though
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  makes failing fun, it's nice to know that there will always be enough money on hand, and that's what this Thought does best.

 <p>
  While playing
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stalker 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , chances are you've gone on an artifact farming spree to acquire some particular ones with particular stat bonuses that will complement your playstyle. However, not all artifacts can be acquired in the same anomalous zone as each artifact is tied to a specific elemental anomaly. Since there's a huge list of artifacts to acquire in the game, this guide makes things easier by detailing the types of anomalous zone you can farm them in.

  There are
  <strong>
   75+ artifacts in
   <em>
    Stalker 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  divided into different rarities, ranging from common to legendary/mythical. While you can acquire some of them during side quests or main story missions, you'll have to farm most of them in a particular anomalous zone. Here's a list of all the artifacts in the game.

  These are all the Artifacts found in

  . If you're looking for a particular artifact in the game, make sure to check which anomaly it's part of and keep farming those zones to get it. Players can also
  <strong>
   make a quick save before approaching an anomaly
  </strong>
  zone, find the artifact, and if it's not the one you're looking for, reload the save and try again.

      <title>6 Longest Dragon Ball Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/longest-dragon-ball-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There has been a remarkable number of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games on nearly every platform available since the hit franchise first rose to prominence. While a lot of the earlier and handheld
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games were short and sweet, a lot of the more recent ones are much longer and have tons of replayability.

 <p>
  What makes ranking
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games by length difficult is the degree of variance that can be involved player to player. Moreover, most
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games have tons of extras, side quests and unlockables for players to sink their teeth into. With that in mind, the best way to rank
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games by length has to be with the help of How Long To Beat, which is an incredible and informative resource. Keeping in mind all the different things a player can do in one of these games, the How Long To Beat information regarding 'Main + Sides' will also be referred to.

  <em>
   Another Road
  </em>
  follows the story of Future Trunks, continuing his plot forward after defeating Cell, the game imagines a scenario where Future Trunks has to deal with Babidi, Dabura and Majin Buu. The game follows a similar narrative arc to
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Z Shin Budokai,
  </em>
  with the obvious change being Future Trunks as the protagonist. The main story should take most players under ten hours. Following completion, players can also fight in Z-trials, which are essentially a more fleshed out arcade mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game does have some minor branching paths depending on in-game decisions and the outcomes of certain battles. Going back to these branching points to see the alternatives would also beef out the game's run time just a bit. Irrespective of that,
  <em>
   Another Road,
  </em>
  while a fun game, is easily one of the shortest gaming experiences the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  franchise has to offer.

  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is one of the most anticipated game releases in a long time. Fortunately for fans, despite all the expectations, most had latched onto this game - it mostly met them all. The actual story mode is fairly standard for games of this type, but players also have access to tournament mode, which can be tweaked with a variety of conditions and rules, as well as a custom mode where tons of variables can be changed. Overall, there are tons of new features for players to check out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game has a massive roster which can lead to dozens of hours of learning different movesets and building the best teams. Moreover, players can engage in local multiplayer, as well as hit the ranked ladder and engage in the regular matches and DP battles. The single player content in this game can easily lead to 20 or more of gameplay. However, the PvP elements are where
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  really shines; various multiplayer modes can lead to hundreds of hours of gameplay.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball FighterZ
  </em>
  is a tricky game to consider in terms of length. While the story and extra content can be done fairly quickly, as a fighting game it has plenty more to offer. Players can play online matches and climb the ranked leaderboard, or simply just duel with friends - both locally and online, for hundreds of hours easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  For fighting game fans, this game has so much to offer. Players can easily spend hundreds of hours fine-tuning their team, finding the best balance, and utilizing their assist moves in different ways. Each character has their own moves, strengths and weaknesses and assists, so there's a lot to tinker with. Players can even make entire teams of just different Goku forms. On the other hand, for casual players, beyond the story mode, players can go through the various towers in arcade mode, but there's not much else in terms of non-PvP content.

   DBZ, Dragon Ball GT,
  </em>

  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  movies. There are also various towers, tournament modes and dozens of ways to unlock different characters from this game's massive roster.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi 3
  </em>

  <em>
   Xenoverse 2
  </em>
  is a sort of role-playing fighting game. Where players can create their own character; be it a Saiyan, Human, Namekian or Frost Demon. Players can customize their character to an exceptional degree, and learn multiple new moves from mentors such as Tienshinhan and Piccolo. Another major selling point in the game is the ability to learn new transformations for all the different races.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Xenoverse 2
  </em>
  is a long and comprehensive game with a story mode that is around 20 hours, as well as multiple online multiplayer modes and tons of extra content through DLCs and Expansions. Players can even sink in several hours exploring Conton City, and doing various side-quests and minigames. For a game that is eight years old, the fact that it is still getting updates and DLCs is impressive and bodes well for how much content this game has for players to go through.

   Dragon Ball Z Kakarot
  </em>
  is essentially a retelling of the entire Dragon Ball Z saga from the Saiyan Arc, all the way to the end of the Buu Arc. Later expansions also added the first few Arcs of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super.
  </em>
  Players get to play through Goku's entire story step by step while also getting a chance to play other important characters, such as Vegeta and Gohan.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game features tons of additional content, be it cooking, fishing or when on Namek, destroying enemy bases.
  <em>
   Kakrot
  </em>
  doesn't tread any new ground, but in terms of a comprehensive gaming experience of the Dragon Ball Z saga, it is clearly unmatched and provides a solid experience for newcomers and loyal fans alike.

   <em>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the greatest grand strategy games ever made. Paradox Interactive has truly knocked it out of the park in their medieval simulation series, with players finding themselves lost in this game for hours on end as they try to form massive dynasties, help rulers flourish, and rewrite the very flow of history itself. The sheer number of things players can accomplish in this game is mind-boggling.

 <p>
  Given how beginner-friendly
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  is, most people might take it a step too far and select any random character on the map to play as. This is a horrible strategy, and players should try getting familiar with the mechanics of this game first with easier rulers before moving on to more complex kingdoms and dynasties.

  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3 is one of the greatest grand strategy games ever made that is perfect for new players to experience just how engaging this title is. Players will have a great time roleplaying as the ruler of their choice and helping their dynasty succeed at all costs. This can force players into some horrific decisions, but this is just a part of what makes Crusader Kings 3 such a joy to play through. If players want to try out some of CK3's best starts with a good ruler, then it's best to keep this information in mind.

  With the addition of the Ruler Designer, players can create a custom ruler in their image and add them to a game if historical accuracy is not a huge concern for them. If players don't care too much about achievements, then they can go completely nuts and create an OP ruler with multiple beneficial traits to make the game easier and more of a power fantasy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, keep in mind that players will need to create a strong legacy if they don't want their inheritances to die out. This is easier said than done, but veteran players should have no trouble forming a long-lasting realm that will keep them entertained for quite some time.

  The Holy Roman Empire can be tough to manage, but beginners who want to enjoy unlimited power that will ease them into the decision-making present in this title will love how engaging this playthrough can be. It's one of the best
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  starts, despite its complexity, because players will have an advantage over pretty much every nation, letting them experiment without being in constant fear of angering vassals or allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, players should still operate within certain constraints, but there's a surprising degree of freedom that can be enjoyed as the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire. As a result, Friedrich "Barbarossa" Hohenstaufen becomes one of the most interesting rulers to roleplay in

  Richard the Lionheart is one of the most popular figures in history, and players who want to help establish this legacy can roleplay as this character before he attained this glory. The game starts with Richard's ailing brother on the verge of death, leaving him first in line to succeed as the King of England.
 </p>
 <p>
  He can be a valiant ruler in no time, but some players can choose to carve their own path and mold Richard into whatever image they see fit. He can rule France as well if one plays their cards right, making him one of the best

  It's easy to see why new players would love to play as a ruler with special scenarios curated just for them, and the five legends of
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  help them achieve this goal and then some. Not only are all of these rulers a joy to control, but they also have high stats in one particular department that help them stand out as some of the

  Given how warfare plays a huge role in the game, it's easy to see why players would be tempted to play as
  <strong>
   Robert de Hauteville, the Duke of Apulia.
  </strong>
  Contrary to what most people think, starting as a ruler with a liege is a better way for players to grasp the basics before expanding their scope, even if it's tempting to play as a king or emperor from the start. This Duke is a competent ruler who can fight his way out of his liege's service and start a kingdom of his own in no time if players wish.

  While every stat in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  is complex in its own right, players who want to be sneaky and use spies and assassinations to fuel their lust for power should play a character with high Intrigue. This makes
  <strong>
   Emir Yahya
  </strong>
  one of the
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    CK3
   </em>

  </strong>
  players can get their hands on. Intrigue is way more complicated than most people would assume, and this character ensures that players can come to grips with the shadier side of ruling a kingdom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plotting an assassination may be a bit too harebrained in the early goings, and it's better for players to slowly build up by getting hooks and blackmailing people first before moving on to more ambitious and sinister plots. It may seem daunting for a beginner, but focusing on a single stat makes things way easier than trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.

  Controlling a duchy may not seem like the most action-packed way to kickstart a playthrough of

   Duke Guilhem

  stand out is the fact that he's one of the strongest dukes serving under the King of France. This gives one of the

  </strong>
  a lot of leeway to shape his rule in whatever manner players see fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can be a tall order to go against the King of France, but players who are successful in freeing themselves from this vassalage can embark on a conquest for the ages and gather allies to form a powerful empire in Europe. For beginner players, learning the ropes and serving under a liege can be done in a jiffy, and it's fine to be ambitious and move on to greener pastures after hitting the ceiling of what they can achieve as a duke.

  Many rulers in India are a blast to control, and one such character that has a wealth of advantages at their disposal is
  <strong>
   Mahasamanta Parakkirama of Pandya
  </strong>
  . Players who want to understand how culture works will find this ruler to be right up their alley, even if they may be overwhelmed when it comes to armies.
 </p>
 <p>
  A great way to make up for this early on is to cement alliances with other rulers to enjoy the benefit of their larger armies in the event of a war. Once the player is safeguarded from any unwanted aggressions, they can get to work hoarding a lot of wealth, forming titles, and expanding their realm until they can form India. It's a challenge, but one that players will be up for once they enjoy the opulence of being the Raj of Pandya.

  It's easy to assume that
  <strong>
   Bjorn 'Ironside'
  </strong>
  may be at a disadvantage, especially once players look at their lack of a proper army that can prevent them from mounting up a defense against their neighbors. As a result, new players will quickly learn how important it is to form alliances, with players ensuring that they're not at risk of being obliterated by other rulers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following these alliances, players must make some diplomatic moves and get more people on their side before going on to form Sweden. It's a tantalizing journey to go through with its fair share of ups and downs, but players who weather the early storm will be greeted with one of the most impactful experiences as a

  The best playthroughs are the ones where players can realistically form alliances and gain control over enough territories to form a country. This can be achieved with rulers like
  <strong>
   Rurik
  </strong>
  , who starts relatively safe and can use a mix of diplomacy and old-school warfare to become one of the most powerful rulers around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Forming Russia is far from an easy task but something that players can go for if they want to attain a major level of success and understand the deeper mechanics of the game. It also serves as great practice for players who want to attain the achievement associated with Rurik, mandating them to form Russia while in control of this ruler in Ironman mode.

  Starting with a kingdom as a beginner may seem daunting, but
  <strong>
   Sancho's
  </strong>
  decent stats and claims to other kingdoms make it quite fun to get used to playing on a greater scale. Players will have a great time using diplomacy and politics to establish their kingdom as one of the biggest powerhouses around.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, players are also in the vicinity of powerful enemies that can take them out in no time flat if players become serial warmongers. This makes it important to pick and choose battles that Sancho's realm can handle before moving on to bigger things.

   The High Chieftess Daurama of Kano
  </strong>
  is one of the best and most unique rulers in
  <em>

  </em>
  . She has enough resources at her disposal to make for a peaceful and lucrative reign, but that's not what makes her special.
 </p>
 <p>
  This dynasty is one of the few ones with enatic succession, which is pretty great indeed. Players who are slightly bored with the focus on male heirs can check this ruler out for themselves.

  <strong>
   Jarl Dyre "The Stranger" of Konugardr
  </strong>
  is another interesting ruler and a fun one for beginners to start with. Players will learn about how titles are inherited through this ruler, and this harsh lesson is learned if they decide to sire an heir.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can potentially lose the name Oskyldr if they have a direct heir, with their firstborn son being the player heir with fewer titles to their name. To solve this dilemma, players should either not have an heir and keep their firstborn as healthy as possible, or legitimize the Jarl as soon as possible.

   Haesteinn of Montaigu

  is one of the most popular characters in the

  community. Players love role-playing as this ruler, making him a great choice for beginners as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  This ruler stays alive for a long time, allowing new players to learn the ropes and come to grips with the game's more complex mechanics. If everything is done right, then the transfer of power should be pretty smooth as well.

  is a highly recommended starting ruler by many players, with beginners benefiting from the massive armies that this ruler controls. Laszlo may be a bit too honest for his own good, but many people argue that this is his only negative trait.
 </p>
 <p>
  A supportive family and great options for marriage make him a great starting ruler in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  . It helps that controlling the area of Transylvania is also pretty engaging in its own right, given its prominence in history and literature.

  Once known as the bastard, controlling
  <strong>
   Duke William
  </strong>
  and role-playing to help him ascend as a king is one of the most satisfying playthroughs anyone can go through. It may be slightly challenging, but beginners will learn a lot through this adversity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should make their relationships wisely and ensure that they don't bite off more than they can chew. A smart and powerful rule is required to win the legendary war and become King of Normandy.

  At the start,
  <strong>
   Yehrehana Krestos
  </strong>
  has a pretty small territory and seems slightly uninteresting to play. However, over time, players will soon realize that this character has a ton of potential to grow.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is mainly because Abyssinia has a ton of cover from the invasions in the North. This, coupled with a lack of worthy adversaries around, makes this ruler a great way to learn how to expand and consolidate kingdoms.

  Players who want to comfortably learn the basics of diplomacy should try playing as
  <strong>
   Sultan Yahya II ibn Yahya of the Idrisid Sultanate
  </strong>
  . His relatively high diplomatic stat and a lack of any warring nations mean that players will enjoy a pretty comfortable reign indeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Forming allies is a pretty major part of
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  , and Sultan Yahya II ibn Yahya helps players learn that in spades. It's easy to see why he's such a favored start for many in the game, especially in the early going.

  Pretty much any area in Ireland serves as a perfect start for a
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  player. After all, there's a reason why so many people call this nation a tutorial area, with the game itself proclaiming the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Uniting Ireland is not the easiest task around, but it makes for a pretty compelling goal regardless. As long as players manage their wars and heirs properly, this Kingdom will soon be theirs.

  Money makes the world go round, and this applies in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  as well. So, players who want to enjoy a loaded playthrough should check out
  <strong>
   King Sancho II 'The Strong' of Castille.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This character might have a sibling rivalry, but most people won't care because of how enjoyable this ruler is to play as. The fact that he's pretty young makes his rule a long and enjoyable one too.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  player shared a strange glitch that occurred during a player wedding, which led to the bride being all alone at the altar. The odd moment is amusing, though it might be a bit frustrating if it were to happen to a
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player who really enjoys the game's cutscenes.

  <em>

  players have two marriage options available to them in the game. In standard single-player mode, players can marry any of the game's eligible partners, regardless of their player character's gender. It's also possible to become roommates with Krobus. For multiplayer mode, though, players can choose to marry another player. It was this particular situation that this player experienced the glitch in.

  A Reddit user called fuzzy_mush took to the game's subreddit to discuss the odd glitch that happened to them. They shared two pictures of two separate Nintendo Switches playing the game. The OP and their spouse were supposed to tie the knot in-game, but something odd happened. In the picture of the wife's screen, everything looks as one would expect, with the two player characters standing at the altar, with the town's NPCs looking on from the audience. However, on the husband's screen, only the wife is visible. The soon-to-be husband is nowhere to be found, and everyone else has simply vanished from the scene, including Mayor Lewis, who should be officiating the wedding between the two
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  farmers.

  Stardew Valley Glitches Draw Attention and Amusement
 </h2>
 <p>
  Ultimately, fuzzy_mush seems to be more amused by the glitch than anything else, and other players have also shared in the humor. Some hypothesized that the husband had just started the game and hadn't made friends with any of the Pelican Town villagers, but that wouldn't explain where everyone else went. The source of this particular glitch seems to be a mystery, and the player didn't state whether or not the wedding carried on as expected, or if it froze or crashed.

  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is a pretty stable game, especially if a player doesn't use any mods. However, it's not completely without glitches. Some weird glitches have included portions of Kent's sprite spontaneously appearing all over the player's farm, hearing weird music, or waking up with a huge amount of gold for no apparent reason. Thankfully, the bugs experienced in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  don't break the game in any way and can be ignored or fixed with a simple reboot.

  is a short daily word game from the New York Times Games. In order to play, you need to figure out all sixteen of the words, and then put them into four mystery categories. The only clues you get for this game are the words themselves, and you have a very small number of tries too.

      Groudon raids in Pokemon GO are challenging due to the boss frequently using Solar Beam, causing frustration among players.

      Recent updates allow raid bosses to generate energy faster and use charged attacks more frequently, making battles harder.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are having trouble battling Groudon, the current boss of the five-star raids. As part of the September events calendar,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has brought a new rotation of raids in which players can take part and battle powerful critters, featuring a selection of Pokemon popular with fans.

 <p>
  Raids are one of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's best-known gameplay elements, in which players team up in Gyms to defeat extremely strong versions of monsters and can catch them after the battles. In addition to the regular raids, which have a difficulty of one, three, and five stars, over the years Niantic has added the Mega, Primal, Shadow, Elite, and EX variants, offering players different forms of challenges. In September, trainers saw the introduction of some Legendary Pokemon in the five-star raids, but one of these creatures is causing headaches.

  players are having a hard time during Groudon raid battles due to the frequency with which it uses Solar Beam. Reddit user Ghent_Florin is one of the trainers who took part in a Groudon raid and says that nine monsters were knocked out by Hoenn's Legendary Pokemon in under 30 seconds. Impressed, they explained that normally they only needed three players to fight the Ground-type, but this time a group of seven trainers struggled a lot during the encounter.

  It's not hard to find other posts complaining or making jokes about the difficulty of Groudon raids, noting how often the Pokemon uses Solar Beam, giving trainers no window of opportunity to fight back. The change came in a recent update and allows raid bosses to generate energy faster. In addition, bosses now use their charged attacks whenever they have energy available, unlike how battles worked before the update.
  <em>

  </em>
  players had the same issue with Kyogre, the previous five-star raid boss, due to the Water-type using Blizzard more times than expected.

  Although devs have adjusted the frequency with which raid bosses use charged attacks, all indications are that the change wasn't enough to reduce player frustration. And while Niantic's game community searches for a way to succeed in raids, Groudon will appear in Raid Hour on September 25, and in regular five-star raids until September 26. After that, it will be replaced by Zacian, who will be available until October 4. In addition to the five-star raids, Zacian will be the highlight of Legendary Heroes, an upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon GO

  event in which trainers will have the chance to get the shiny variant of the Gen 8 Legendary for the first time.

  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War: Ragnarok

  </strong>

 <p>
  The Draupnir Spear in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  is plenty of fun, and it further makes the powerful arsenal of Kratos even more powerful in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  . To become the very best, players should be aware of the best
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  Draupnir Spear Runic attacks, to maximize its potential in the war against the Aesir gods.

   As players re-enter the Nine Realms as Kratos and Atreus against the forces of Norse gods, they will find themselves needing an assortment of weaponry for God of War Ragnarok on PS4, PS5 and PC, with one of the more unique being that of the Draupnir Spear. All Draupnir Spear Runic Attacks can provide God of War Ragnarok players with a violent arsenal best utilized by the Spartan God of War, with each effect and location found below.

  With the Draupnir Spear being a highlight of Kratos' skills and strength, the Mountain Splitter runic attack in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  provides Kratos with a multitude of long-range slashes toward the air, in which the intense force will stagger enemies. This can be expected by precisely pressing R1 during the slashes to make each wave stronger.

 <p>
  Despite having 5 points in Damage, 3 in Force and 1 in Stun for its final upgraded performance with 8,000 XP, the Mountain Splitter doesn't tend to do a lot of damage and leaves Kratos vulnerable from behind.

  This runic attack has Kratos spin the Draupbir Spear in the air, sending forth a powerful wave of force that brings his enemies towards him. He then slams the Draupnir Spear, forcing enemies to heave backwards and give himself time for his next attack.

 <p>
  The Whisper of the World runic attack can be upgraded to tier 3 with 8,000 XP and will have 3 points in Damage, 5 in Force, and 2 in Stun. The Force can be greatly strengthened, but also gives enemies an advantage, as they have been pushed away from Kratos, meaning they can use ranged attacks against the Ghost of Sparta.

 <p>
  This long-range Spear thrust has Kratos lunge toward an enemy to embed them with the Draupnir Spear. He then pulls out the Spear and will have the enemy's element on his Spear. This can be upgraded to have Kratos invulnerable through a wind shell as he charges, meaning he can get to his target with little worry of damage to himself.

 <p>
  Through upgrades, this attack will only warrant 3 in Damage, 1 in Force, and 2 in Stun, but the fact that it allows Kratos to reach his enemies practically indestructible whilst doing so means that there will never be a ranged advantage for the enemies in

  Kratos will take a short lunge forward as he will repeatedly stab at an enemy with a flurry of vengeance. Mashing R1 during this ability will have Kratos continue to stab and embed more spears into his enemy so that they can be detonated and exploded, as dangerous as Surtr in Ragnarok.

  With a cooldown of 71 seconds and a great emphasis on power and Damage, the Thrust of a Thousand Soldiers will have Kratos honor the fallen Spartan warriors as he proves just how effective he is with a thrusting Spear. With a full upgrade of 5 points in Damage and 1 for Force and Stun, this Damage-reliant ability will stagger and hurt.

  An array of cyclones will rampage through the battlefield as Kratos swings the Draupnir Spear. This will damage all enemies within the chaotic path of the cyclones, and upgrading the ability will also create more cyclones with wider travel arcs and greater durations.

 <p>
  Although fully upgrading this runic attack warrants 4 points in Damage, 1 in Force and 5 in Stun, the fact that the pathing of the cyclones is random, leaves much to be desired, and not a lot of great connecting hits for the enemies.

  Kratos will hurl the Draupnir Spear into the sky, which will rain down multiple spears from its duplicating ring. The quantity and duration of this onslaught of spears are increased with each upgrade, leaving plenty of room for destruction in the barrage of spears.

 <p>
  Despite 4 points in Damage, 2 in Force, and 2 in Stun, Artillery of the Ancients is underwhelming for the fact that once thrown, it can be focused on one area. Enemies can easily walk out of the way of this attack, and the spears will hit the ground with no enemies in sight.

 <p>
  Leaping into the air, Kratos will perform a long-range dive that sees him slamming the spear into the ground with an intense and overwhelming force. By holding R2, this move is charged up for more damage, whilst a gust of wind staggers enemies into position, making them perfect targets in
  <em>
   Ragnarok.

 <p>
  This is a great heavy runic attack to use if players are struggling to catch up to enemies, or they just need to create space for themselves by knocking multiple enemies away. A fully upgraded version of Honor the Fallen nets players 4 points in Damage, 5 in Force and 2 in Stun.

  All gods have intense strength, but Kratos seems the only one capable of creating a tornado from the spin of a spear. In this attack, Kratos summons a massive tornado that tumbles towards enemies like bowling pins, lined up for Atreus to shoot.

  The cooldown is rather intense, with 231 seconds per use. At its 3rd tier, the Finger of Ruin has brilliant stats with 5 in Damage, 4 in Force, and 3 in Stun. It's the most versatile and helps Kratos to keep enemies at bay when he may otherwise be overwhelmed.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Neverwinter Nights

  </strong>
  is one of the most intense
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  experiences available, featuring a heartbreaking and tremendously dark story, thousands of enemies to beat, and several realms to save from the forces of evil. The game received dozens of updates and several DLCs in the form of campaigns that added hundreds of hours of gameplay and challenging new enemies.

  The franchise is also famous for allowing players to test out the
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  3.0 ruleset, which was quite the rage at that time. The sequel,
  <em>
   Neverwinter Nights 2
  </em>
  , used
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  3.5, but to be fair, the first game is a little better, both in terms of narrative and character background depth. Still, undoubtedly, this is one of
  <strong>
   BioWare's best franchises
  </strong>
  , and it is still fairly playable today, allowing for an integrated modding system and hundreds of custom campaigns crafted by a community of enthusiastic DMs.

  From the beginning,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  has always been quite a flashy IP, and BioWare knew how to make the most out of it with memorable characters, incredibly deep storytelling, and thrilling world-building that has captivated the minds of millions of fans worldwide. The story narrates the adventures of Captain Shepard and their colorful crew, looking for a way to co-exist amidst a galaxy-wide crisis that threatens to wipe out all sentient species for good.

 <p>
  The games were critically acclaimed (except for
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  ) for their revolutionary take on character relationships and deeply intertwined RPG mechanics. With so many points in its favor, it is no surprise that it has become one of the top sci-fi game franchises of all time. Perhaps the best thing about
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  is that it proposes a scenario where mankind and other species have gathered together and work for a common goal, despite all cultural (and biological) differences, providing players with a promising future to look forward to.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic
   </strong>
  </em>
  (or
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  ) is another one of BioWare's greatest hits, created using the piece of the expanded universe written by the legendary Drew Karpyshyn. The game narrates the events prior to the Imperial Period, approximately 4000 years before the Battle of Yavin (BBY), and tells the tale of Revan, a former Jedi who fell to the Dark Side and then redeemed himself (somewhat) by trying to stop Darth Malak in his rise to power.

 <p>
  The sequel follows up the steps of Revan and the Exile, another controversial figure of the Old Republic age, who abandoned the Jedi order under similar terms, and then, upon meeting a mysterious undead woman (Kreia) and reconnecting to the Force, was sent on a quest to stop Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus from finding the Star Forge and unleashing its power upon the Galaxy. The story of the franchise is enthralling and deep, featuring a lot of memorable characters and incredible dialog lines. It has become something of a fan favorite
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game series, and there are constant rumors about it being turned into a movie, a show, or receiving a remake. And that speaks louder than anything about how deep the fans' love for the franchise is.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age
   </strong>
  </em>
  was one of the greatest revelations of the past 15 years, featuring a dark, mature fantasy setting, and some incredibly well-developed characters. The franchise has a wide casting of wholesome, lovable, and believable characters who have sprouted from the imagination of really talented people, like The Gray Warden, Morrigan, Hawke, Varric, Sera, and Cassandra Penthagast (among others). And of course, some of the greatest villains, too, including the mysterious (and dead) Flemeth, the gruesome Corypheus, and Solas, the traitor of the hour.

 <p>
  With the upcoming launch of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , fans are tremendously excited about the sequel of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  finally bringing closure to a decade of mystery about the motivations of its main antagonist and his evil plan to bend the reality of Thedas to his will. So, in other words,
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  might very well be one of the best fantasy franchises that has ever surfaced from this powerhouse of a game development company.

  BioWare developed its magnum opus using a skillful narrative, a great soundtrack, and the ruleset for
  <em>
   AD&amp;D
  </em>
  2nd Edition, and that was a combination that gave birth to the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise. Of course, many players are more accustomed to the modern version of
  <em>
   BG
  </em>
  developed by Larian Studios, but back in the day when the franchise first saw the light of day, it went up with a bang. From the incredibly well-narrated main storyline to its final iteration,
  <em>
   Throne Of Bhaal,
  </em>
  the franchise has given birth to many memorable characters, with Minsc, the Rashemaar Range, and his pet "Miniature Giant Space Hamster" Boo being some the most notorious ones.

 <p>
  Of course, the legend of Baldur's Gate didn't end up staying for too long with BioWare, and there were a lot of incredible spin-offs of the series developed by other developers, like the
  <em>
   Dark Alliance
  </em>
  series delivered to players by Snowblind Studios and Black Isle Studios. And though the success of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  was considerable, gamers should never forget about the studio that set the foothold for the franchise to grow into the incredible success that it is today.

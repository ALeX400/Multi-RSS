  Hero Talents in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The War Within
   </em>
  </strong>
  introduce new layers of gameplay and delve deeper into the unique class fantasies related to each specialization. These self-contained talent trees become available at level 71, with players gaining full access to all nodes by level 80.

  Rogues have three distinct Hero Talent trees to choose from:
  <strong>
   Deathstalker
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Fatebound
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Trickster
  </strong>
  . Each specialization can access two of these trees, allowing for tailored gameplay and thematic experiences. Here's an overview of all three Rogue Hero Talents in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: The War Within

 <p>
  The Deathstalker Hero Talent tree is available to Assassination and Subtlety Rogues, transforming them into lethal harbingers of death, striking with precision from the shadows. This talent tree draws inspiration from the Forsaken's assassin guild and revolves around its keystone node,
  <strong>
   Deathstalker's Mark
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Deathstalker's Mark allows players to apply three stacks of its mark on a target with Ambush (Assassination) or Shadowstrike (Subtlety). Each stack of the mark can then be consumed by a finishing move for increased damage. After all three stacks have been consumed,
  <strong>
   Darkest Night
  </strong>
  empowers the next Envenom or Eviscerate used at maximum combo points, while also reapplying three stacks of Deathstalker's Mark.

 <p>
  The Deathstalker tree provides incredibly strong priority and funnel damage through the core loop of mark consumption and reapplication. Additionally, it also offers great defensive capabilities through
  <strong>
   Bait and Switch
  </strong>
  and increased mobility via
  <strong>
   Shadewalker
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Fatebound Hero Talent tree is accessible to both Assassination and Outlaw Rogues. Fatebound does not introduce any rotational changes for either specialization, and it leans heavily on the randomness of its keystone node,
  <strong>
   Hand of Fate
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Each time a finishing move consumes five or more combo points, a Fatebound Coin is flipped. If the coin lands on Heads, the Rogue’s damage is increased, while landing on Tails deals out Cosmic damage to the target. Consecutively landing on the same side of the coin further amplifies the effect of each face, adding another layer of unpredictability.

 <p>
  While Fatebound Rogues have the potential to perform well, the inherent randomness of the specialization can lead to significant variance in performance, particularly when it comes to the capstone node,
  <strong>
   Fateful Ending
  </strong>
  . This issue is further compounded in Mythic+ settings, where frequent downtime can make it nearly impossible to consistently capitalize on Fateful Ending's effects.

 <p>
  The Trickster Hero Talent tree, available to Outlaw and Subtlety Rogues, centers around
  <strong>
   Unseen Blade
  </strong>
  , which routinely causes Dispatch (Outlaw) and Eviscerate (Subtlety) to become
  <strong>
   Coup de Grace
  </strong>
  . To maximize the potential of this tree, players must invest a talent point in Killing Spree (Outlaw) and Secret Technique (Subtlety) to fully engage with the core gameplay loop.

 <p>
  A key buff in the Trickster tree is
  <strong>
   Flawless Form
  </strong>
  , which provides a stackable damage increase for finishing moves. Flawless Form is primarily maintained through Unseen Blade, Killing Spree or Secret Technique, and Coup de Grace. Unlike the more passive nature of the Fatebound tree, Trickster offers interesting rotational changes that hinge on the timing of Coup de Grace.

  Additionally,
  <strong>
   Nimble Flurry
  </strong>
  allows Subtlety Rogues to strike additional nearby enemies with some of their abilities, similar to how
  <em>
   Blade Flurry
  </em>
  functions for Outlaw. Trickster also introduces a quality-of-life improvement with the
  <strong>
   So Tricky
  </strong>
  talent, which is especially valuable in Mythic+.

      <title>Horizon: Forbidden West Walked So That Astro Bot Could Run</title>

  One of PlayStation’s greatest strengths is its wide catalog of exclusive titles, ranging from 2005’s
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  to the relatively recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  . By having these games available exclusively on PlayStation consoles, it encourages people to purchase these consoles in order to play these acclaimed titles. However, some exclusive titles have been ported to PC in recent years, including
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , to allow a greater range of players to experience these games' expansive worlds and captivating gameplay. With rumors of the upcoming PlayStation 5-exclusive
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  coming to PC in the near future, PC players may once again be able to play through another PlayStation game.

  For most of PlayStation’s lifetime, console exclusives have remained locked to the consoles they initially released on. While many exclusives would be remastered or remade in later console generations, such as the
  <em>
   God of War Collection
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix
  </em>
  on PS3, exclusive games wouldn’t be ported to PC en masse until the PS4 generation. As PC gaming became increasingly popular in the mid to late 2010s, the number of console-exclusive ports to the platform also increased. While it often took several years for games to be ported to PC after their initial console release, many were eventually brought to PC, such as
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition
  </em>
  , 2018’s
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  .

  By the time the PS5 debuted in 2020, many PlayStation exclusives had already been released on PC and this trend only increased throughout the PS5’s generation. Landmark hits from
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  , and even new games such as
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  can already be bought on PC. However, not every exclusive has been ported to PC with many fan favorites still locked to their console platforms, such as
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , 2018’s
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  , and 2020’s
  <em>
   Demon’s Souls
  </em>
  . Despite this, many more exclusives are already expected to be released on PC soon, including
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarök
  </em>
  and the upcoming
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  remake.

  Four games for the
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  series have been released so far, including
  <em>
   The PlayRoom
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The PlayRoom VR
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Astro Bot Rescue Mission
  </em>
  for the PS4’s PS VR, and
  <em>
   Astro’s Playroom,
  </em>
  which is pre-loaded on every PS5 console. None of these games have been ported to PC yet, nor has
  <em>
   The PlayRoom VR
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Astro Bot Rescue Mission
  </em>
  been ported to the PS VR2. The fifth entry in the
  <em>
   Astro
  </em>
  series, simply titled
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , will be released on September 6th exclusively for PS5, but there is potential for the game to be released on PC after its initial console debut.

 <p>
  According to a recent interview with the independent games media outlet MinnMax,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's creative director, Nicolas Doucet, claimed that he and other developers from Team ASOBI want to hear from PC players about the possibility of the game releasing on PC. While there are no plans for
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  to release on PC currently, it could come to PC in later months or even years later. It took
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  two years from its initial 2022 console debut to release on PC, so it could take a while for
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  to come to PC even if it’s successful.

  Potential Ports of Prior Astro Bot Games

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is successful and receives an eventual PC release, Sony and Team ASOBI could potentially work on further ports of the previous
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  games. Team ASOBI could work on porting
  <em>
   The PlayRoom VR
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rescue Mission
  </em>
  to PSVR2 or other PC VR platforms such as the Meta Quest. Likewise, Team ASOBI could potentially port
  <em>
   Astro’s Playroom
  </em>
  to PC as well. All of these ports could help new PC players become fans of the series and lead to more future PlayStation sales, just as
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  ports have done before.

      <title>5 Great Konami Franchises That Seem Unlikely To Ever Make A Comeback</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Konami
  </strong>
  has a lot of renowned and beloved franchises under its belt. Franchises like
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  are very likely to see some form of new entry in the future. There are also some properties that have not been given enough love of late but are still high-profile enough to see a new release down the line.

 <p>
  However, there are also other
  <strong>
   franchises owned by Konami
  </strong>
  that are so far out of the limelight, that they may never see another entry. These titles deserve more attention for a chance at being revived so that they may stand alongside some of Konami’s most influential franchises.

  <em>
   Bloody Roar
  </em>
  is a game that has fallen from the limelight but used to be one of the most iconic 3D fighting game franchises with its debut on Arcade machines and the original PlayStation. The game lets players select from a wide roster of different human characters that can each transform into a mighty human-beast hybrid form. Players were able to make use of extremely hard-hitting moves with high amounts of knock-back, instantaneous juggling combos, and were able to leap high into the air.

  Its development team of Hudson Soft would merge with Konami Digital Entertainment, which has grossly underutilized the properties and assets acquired from this merger back in 2012.
  <em>
   Blood Roar
  </em>
  is a game whose few loyal fans still wish to be revived and believe it to be one of the games that were far ahead of their time. It has remained untouched since 2003 and it does not look like there are any plans to pick it back up based on Konami's track record with it so far.

  This is a platforming game series with top-notch gameplay for each release that evolved with the times and adopted mechanics and quality-of-life improvements throughout its lifespan. This makes each game worth playing from the first in 1986, to its final video game release in 2005. The game features heavy ninja-inspired esthetics and themes, including tropes and music to really get players invested in the theme.

 <p>
  The mainline series saw a release almost every year from 1989 to 2005, with some years having 2 to 3 releases. This is more impressive than the
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  track record of mainline entries. Players who enjoy this franchise and are in dire need of a new entry can look to the 2024 game
  <em>
   Bakeru
  </em>
  on the Nintendo Switch, which captures a lot of the magic that made this franchise so enjoyable. Konami has resigned a lot of its properties to simply being themes to gambling machines, and this is sadly one of those franchises — with said machine releasing in 2011. As such, it's doubtful it will make a proper comeback.

  Tactical RPGs are not for everyone and used to be enjoyed by a very niche market. However, games like
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  have helped thrust this genre into the mainstream to cause a surge of interest. Vandal Hearts has a very well-designed and engaging story, and its gameplay will be something many TRPG enthusiasts will enjoy because of how much depth its levels offer. Almost every map feels like the layout and positioning of characters truly matter, rather than just being mild elevations.

  After over a decade since its sequel,
  <em>
   Vandal Hearts 2
  </em>
  , a new entry was released in 2010, but has not had any interest since. Despite having no news on any form of revival, this stands as one of the best RPG games Konami has to offer. The franchise does not come close to more well-known Konami titles and lacks a large enough fanbase to believe that Konami might consider doing more with the property.

  The

  games offer many different gameplay experiences, some involving racing, and others involving pulling off tricks. These games all came out during the 90s and lean heavily into the skateboarder culture of the time. The game was designed to focus on capitalizing on the popularity surrounding skateboarding, and while the games offered fun experiences, these gameplay elements themselves could be transferable to other esthetics.

  It is very unlikely that this franchise will ever see any form of revival, as none of the games have even seen any form of re-release since their launch systems. A lot of classic games have seen re-releases on newer systems, but this usually involves the title being very popular. However, there are still some great console-exclusive games that have never been re-released.

  The original game,

  , had a cartridge that could detect the presence of actual sunlight. Should players go outside in the daytime while playing the game, they could charge up the weapons they used in the game. As the sun sets in the real world, so will it in the game, and players will need to charge their weapons at specific locations.

  The game did see a spiritual successor in the form of
  <em>

  , which let players swap between characters, and had a higher focus on action, despite the franchise heavily incorporating stealth elements. This franchise was spearheaded by the legendary Hideo Kojima of

  fame — who has worked on some noteworthy titles over the course of his career. There is a lot of bad blood between Kojima and Konami, and because of that, the three years between 2003 and 2006 may be the only time this franchise may witness any development.

      <title>Helldivers 2 Can't Leave the Meridia Supercolony Behind Entirely</title>

 <p>
  In what might have been the most awesome example of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s storytelling, Super Earth high command had the playerbase destroy an entire planet not too far back. When the planet Meridia became overrun by a Terminid supercolony, there were a series of major orders in place designed around a multistep plan to turn the planet into a black hole. None of this happened that long ago, but
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has put it in the rearview and it is a shame that a comparable mission type has not been replicated since.

  Dealing with the supercolony was one of the most fun periods in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , right up there with the defense of Malevelon Creek and launch week. While Meridia itself might just be an ominous black hole at this point, Arrowhead could score some easy brownie points with a largely disaffected fanbase by stirring up some more supercolonies across the galaxy.

  Thankfully, it seems the Terminids are busy little bugs—always evolving and always pushing back against players’ efforts to stomp them out. The circumstances surrounding
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's Meridia supercolony were relatively unique and yet nothing is saying more can’t crop up in other corners of the galactic map (it’s certainly big enough to spare a few planets).

 <p>
  The ongoing Gloom cloud surrounding the farthest reaches of the Terminid front may end up being just what the doctor ordered to get some more supercolonies. It’s too early to say for sure what that foreboding cloud of orange smoke is out in the distance, but it’s probably nothing good. With any luck it'll be something players can rally against and arm themselves with the best primary weapons
  <em>
   Helldivers 2

  Terminids Can Take Some Inspiration from The Automatons

 <p>
  The Meridia supercolony functioned like a planet-wide base for the bugs. The infestation on that planet was so bad that players couldn't even start a mission on the planet until it was time to blow it up using the dark fluid. Effectively, a supercolony is a mega stronghold for the bugs, and it makes sense if there’s more than one of them.

 <p>
  After being ejected from the game map a while back, the Automatons came back with a vengeance. It wouldn't be a surprise to see one or more planets with bot or bug installations be primed for a particularly definitive liberation, and
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is in dire need of a refresher on authentic mission types like the Dark Fluid one on Meridia.

 <p>
  The supercolony was too engaging of a concept to just be a one-and-done design. It’s understandable that Arrowhead wants to push the envelope in other ways, but the studio is sitting on a proverbial gold mine of fun content with a mission type as dynamic as Meridia's. Sometimes the only way forward is to take a look back and more planets should suffer the same fate as Meridia if it means spreading democracy even further.

   <strong>
    Slitterhead
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Bokeh Game Studio has shown more footage of the horror game’s possession mechanic at Pax West, and the devs were keen to highlight that players can possess and play as a dog. From the mind of
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  creator Keiichiro Toyama,
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  was announced in 2021, and the title received an extended showcase at this year’s Summer Game Fest to show off the mechanics and unsettling body horror elements.

 <p>
  The battle action-adventure game is set in the fictional streets of Kowlong, and it’s home to the supernatural entity, Hyoki, who players will control in an attempt to rid the city of nightmarish monsters by possessing residents.
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  has drawn many comparisons to
  <em>
   Ghostwire: Tokyo
  </em>
  , the 2022 game by Tango Gameworks, and horror fans are hoping
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  doesn’t lose sight of its darker themes in favor of action.

  <em>

  gameplay was showcased at Pax West and shared by Gematsu, detailing the game’s possession mechanic. Hyoki can seize the city locals to travel during high-octane chase scenes in the dark, urban setting, and the entity can also switch bodies during combat against the titular creatures. In addition to exhibiting the blood and gore in the gameplay footage, the
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  devs drew particular attention to dog possession, showing Hyoki’s spirit entering through a stray dog’s mouth, and using the canine’s heightened sense of smell to follow a scent through the alleyways.

  Usually, gamers are keen to find out if they can pet dogs in upcoming games, but Bokeh Game Studio takes animal encounters to another level.
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ’s innovative possession mechanic is influenced by Toyama’s 2003 survival horror game,
  <em>
   Siren
  </em>
  , and also calls upon the combat mechanics of the designer’s 2012 title
  <em>
   Gravity Rush
  </em>
  . Additionally, the possession system will challenge players’ morale, as it has been emphasized that human bodies are disposable.

 <p>
  Furthermore, the game’s possession mechanic frames
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ’s art direction, presenting anime-styled characters for Hyoki to pilot in its path and frightening monsters with
  <em>
   The Thing
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Beetlejuice
  </em>
  influences to battle. The horror community and fans of
  <em>
   Jujutsu Kaisen
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Parasyte
  </em>
  are sure to find a lot to love in
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ’s fascinating style.

  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  is scheduled to be released on November 8, which means the title is just missing out on October’s hotbed for horror games. The spooky season’s release schedule is packed, including the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  remakes and
  <em>
   Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  . There’s plenty for the horror community to digest, and here’s hoping
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  brings some originality to the genre.

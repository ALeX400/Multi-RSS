  Ekko is one of the most well-designed
  <em>
   <strong>
    League of Legends

  </em>
  characters in terms of lore, gameplay, and cosmetics. Zaun's time warping wonderkid has been featured in a variety of skin collections ever since his release in 2015.

  Ekko was already one of the more notable mid lane champions in
  <em>
   League of Legends,
  </em>
  and his popularity has substantially increased ever since his appearance in the hit Netflix series,
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  . Those who choose to play him in the game have a number of options when it comes to cosmetics. It's time to take a look at the ten skins Ekko currently has and rank them from worst to best.

  Academy Ekko, unfortunately, secures the last spot on this list as Ekko's worst
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  skin. This skin was released in 2015, and it has aged quite poorly compared to all of his other skins. Ekko is dressed in a school uniform with minimal changes to his overall design.

  There are no major changes in the visual effects of his abilities, which is a big let-down. Unless players get this skin in their loot, it is best not to purchase this mediocre skin, as it does not change much from his base model.

  Closely following the Academy skin is Ekko's default skin. While it is extremely well-designed to capture the unique ambiance of Ekko, it is a default skin that pales in comparison to his other prominent skins.

  There is not much else to critique about this cosmetic, as everyone who owns Ekko will have this skin. It does its job effectively, but does not hold a candle to the remaining entries on this list.

  SKT T1 Ekko is a special skin for The Boy Who Shattered Time. This skin can only be acquired during the period of MSI or Worlds. Furthermore, this is a cosmetic in honor of former SKT T1's top laner Lee "Duke" Ho-Seong, who won the 2016
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  World Championship.

 <p>
  The skin incorporates a gold-and-red color palette, while featuring the SKT T1 logo on some of his abilities. The sound effects are not the crispiest, and it falls in the land of mediocrity as a cosmetic that is just there. It is a decent skin, but it does not have any outstanding features to make it truly shine.

 <p>
  The Star Guardian skin universe is one of the few collections that just does not fit well with Ekko's thematic. While it is a unique take on his character and an unexpected skin universe for him to feature in, the visuals and character model are not the greatest.

 <p>
  The abilities lack a powerful punch, and they do not have the same smoothness compared to the best Ekko skins. Some of the chromas do make this skin look gorgeous, but this is an example of a skin that could have been so much better.

  Trick or Treat is one of Ekko's most underrated skins, due to its rare availability in the store. This skin has apt sound effects and gives an interesting vibe to Ekko's abilities.

 <p>
  The major downsides of this skin are the redesign of his melee weapon and the fact that the colors do not suit him too well. Overall, it is a middle of the pack skin for Ekko, though it still deserves a lot more recognition than it gets.

 <p>
  Firelight Ekko remains faithful to his appearance in
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  's first season. This is the quintessential example of a skin where minimal, smooth visual effects synchronize well to create wonders. The green color featured in all of his abilities makes it even cooler and more impactful. This skin expertly captures Ekko's undying allegiance to the Firelights as their leader.

 <p>
  Ekko's foray into the PROJECT skin universe saw him receive his first Epic skin, and it does not disappoint despite being released several years ago. Ever since his release, the PROJECT skin line was a no-brainer for Ekko to be featured in, considering his background as an inventor and time manipulator.

 <p>
  Once again, the green aesthetic works quite well on this skin. The sound effects and the visual changes to his abilities are the best parts of this skin. PROJECT: Ekko remains one of the most popular skins for Zaun's rebellious tinkerer.

  Sandstorm is easily Ekko's most distinct skin. When players look at this champion, they would not expect him to be featured in a desert-based skin collection. However, Riot Games did a phenomenal job designing this cosmetic. This skin is an absolute steal too, costing only 975 Riot Points.

 <p>
  Ekko's attire is phenomenal and captures the essence of a wandering nomad. The visuals of his abilities are not the best, but the sound effects more than make up for it. It is one of Ekko's smoothest skins, and a staple for players that main him.

  Pulsefire is another skin collection for Ekko that fits like a glove. The technologically advanced, futuristic sound effects elevate this skin to a new degree. The default color palette fits him surprisingly well, with a bunch of noteworthy chromas as well.

  The only gripe with this skin is the underwhelming in-game character model. Aside from this one blemish, the SFX and ability design makes it one of Ekko's best skins in

  It is only fitting for Ekko's only legendary skin to be his best. True Damage is, hands down, one of the best designed skins in the game. Ekko's fluid movement, epic voice lines, eye-catching visuals, and empowering sound effects make this the complete package.

  It is evident that Riot went all-out in making this skin, and it was a resounding success. It reinterprets Ekko as a successful rapper for the band GIANTS, and incorporates the catchy characteristics of his alternate persona seamlessly. True Damage Ekko remains a hallmark for music-based skins in
  <em>
   League of Legends.

      <title>Twitch Has Banned Dan Saltman</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  has banned Dan Saltman, an outspoken critic of the livestreaming platform and host of the “Anything Else?” podcast. The content creator has openly accused Twitch of antisemitism and taken particular offense at Hasan “Hasanabi” Piker not being held accountable by the platform for his anti-Israel livestreams.

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->
 <p>
  Additionally, Saltman has vocally urged advertisers to stop supporting Twitch in light of its alleged antisemitism. Whether the content creator’s pleas have been directly effective is not clear. However, journalist Richard Lewis recently stated that sources at Twitch have confirmed that approximately 11 “corporations and agencies” had suspended their advertising initiatives with the platform.

 <p>
  On November 21, Saltman revealed that he had been indefinitely suspended from Twitch. The streamer claims that he had been planning on deleting his account anyway and that he was unsurprised by the company’s decision. “It seems that someone was definitely watching my account like a hawk,” said Saltman in a tweet discussing the matter. The content creator had been asking his viewers to be activists and encourage advertisers to abandon Twitch. He had also created websites pointing out the discrepancies in the platform’s moderation decisions, which he claims are founded in racism at the highest levels. “The fact it took this long [to ban me] is almost a ode [sic] to the incompetence of Twitch,” the streamer stated.

 <p>
  Notably, Saltman was also slated to appear on a livestream with fellow content creator Asmongold, who has been planning to “expose” Twitch. Although Dan Saltman has been calling out some of the company’s employees for racism and even created websites to pressure CEO Dan Clancy to resign, there is apparently still more to be revealed. According to Asmongold, in fact, “some of the most damaging information has not come out yet,” and Saltman believes that his suspension from Twitch was partly to “keep me from speaking with other creators.” It’s now unclear whether Asmongold will go through with the exposé livestream.

  Losing advertisers isn’t the only trouble the streaming platform may be dealing with. In November, entrepreneur Elon Musk added Twitch to his ongoing lawsuit against Twitter advertisers. According to the suit, at least 18 companies formed an illegal alliance that conspired to boycott the social media site in November 2022. Twitch, claims Musk, hasn’t purchased ads on Twitter in the United States since that time and has minimally spent advertising dollars on the site in other countries.

 <p>
  However, it hasn’t been only unpleasant happenings for the Amazon-owned company. On November 22, Twitch streamer Kai Cenat has surpassed 500,000 subscribers, thanks in part to his ongoing subathon that began on November 1. No other streamer in history has reached that number, marking a remarkable achievement for the 22 year old.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has created a new mod for Ghostface, and it adds the famous Wazzup mask to the game.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has an impressive history of guest characters released in previous games, with the franchise reaching new heights in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Since its release in September last year,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  has added characters from the franchise familiar to fans, such as Ermac, Takeda, and Quan-Chi, as part of the first DLC pack. This same pack brought DC's Peacemaker and two famous Superman counterparts, with Homelander (
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  ) and Omni-Man (
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  ) joining the game's cast. With the release of Kombat Pack 2, more characters arrived in the game, with the first guest being the terrifying Ghostface.

 <p>
  But the serial killer's debut was marred by the absence of the wazzup mask in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , something that modder DazzyAllen solved with a new mod. Available on Nexus Mods, the “Ghostface - Scary Movie” mod finally gives the kombatant the wazzup mask, in which he appears with his tongue hanging out and a playful, terrifying look. For players who want the full experience, another mod by the same user is available on the same website. It adds the mask to the character icon in the fighter selection screen and turns Darrius, one of the Kameo Fighters, into another Ghostface with a wazzup mask.

  Ghostface has donned various frightening masks throughout his history in the horror genre, such as an aged-colored one, and the devil mask, with a vibrant shade of red and long horns. With Ghostface's arrival in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , the cosmetics appear in the game alongside others. These include the Woodsbro Butcher, with spikes on its head and a huge smile with pointed teeth similar to Venom's, and an adaptation of Scorpion's mask.

  For owners of the Khaos Reigns expansion, Bundle, or Collection, Ghostface is available in advance until November 26. From that day on, the fighter will be available to all
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  players, who will have access to his brutal moves inspired by the
  <em>
   Scream
  </em>
  franchise. Following the fighter's arrival, the next release will be Conan the Barbarian, with NetherRealm Studios adding the popular version of the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The latest addition to Kombat Pack 2 will be the T-1000, the antagonist from
  <em>
   Terminator 2: Judgment Day
  </em>
  , and the second character from the
  <em>
   Terminator
  </em>
  franchise to appear in

 <p>
  Western RPGs continue to be one of the most dominant genres in the video games industry, with players loving the idea of either controlling a solo hero or giving orders to a party. Dictating the growth of the main heroes is important for players to be strong enough to tackle mid and late-game enemies, especially in the case of RPGs that boast intricate class systems.

 <p>
  It becomes important for players to make a decision on the class they want to control, compelling them to invest points in a manner that helps them make the most of their abilities. It can be overwhelming at times, but players will love the idea of controlling heroes with unique classes as they lay waste to the many hapless enemies that stand in their way.

   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the greatest CRPGs ever made, accomplishing the impossible goal of living up to the legacy of its predecessors — and even surpassing it, in the eyes of many. This beautiful CRPG is full to the brim with meaningful role-playing options and a class system that helps every party member feel interesting and unique to use in combat.

 <p>
  Players don't have to worry about being stuck to a class, since they can always revert their choices and start from the beginning to dictate each party member's progression. Players will love using a wealth of unique class abilities to lay waste to their foes in style, teaming up to take on the toughest foes without breaking a sweat.

  games have featured the same amount of gameplay depth and variety as the title that started it all.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: Origins

  was special, and it catapulted the series to the very top as one of the most riveting video game IPs of all time.

 <p>
  It helped that the game was jam-packed with replayability and gameplay variety, with players getting to choose one of three classes that they can further specialize in to gain access to unique movesets. This — coupled with several distinct origin stories customized to race, class, or caste — ensures that players can clock in multiple playthroughs in
  <em>

  without getting bored.

  Before
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , Larian Entertainment wowed CRPG veterans with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Divinity: Original Sin 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , one of the deepest and most complex games in the genre to release at that point. The addition of Physical and Magical Armor meant that specializing in certain builds was more important than ever before, which made multiclassing less viable in the eyes of many.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1162} -->

 <p>
  However, this was a small price to pay for players who could take on the role of unique classes and beat down their opposition in style. Given how the difficulty of this game peaks in both the early and late game, it's important to quickly learn how these classes work and retain this information until the very end of a memorable adventure.

  For an action RPG that focuses on frenetic combat scenarios, it's amazing to see just how varied the classes in
  <strong>
   <em>

  are. A player's approach in combat varies based on the build they pursue, with Shepard being a joy to control no matter what players decide for their class.

  Players can specialize into one of six main classes, each of which is a joy to control. Vanguards can jump into the fray of combat and use shotguns to obliterate enemies up close, while Engineers hack enemy tech and use special abilities to support the crew in battle.

  It's a shame that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in a broken state on the same day as one of the most revolutionary video games of all time (
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  ). This prevented a lot of players from enjoying the magic of this unique Western RPG where every vampire type felt unique.

 <p>
  Two notable highlights here are the Nosferatu and Malkavian clans. The latter is so grotesque that merely being seen in public is enough to violate the Masquerade, while the latter is insane and talks in riddles. It's a great way to enhance the game's variety, ensuring that players will have a great time controlling the player character as they navigate the seedy underbelly of this game and get roped into a struggle between different vampiric factions.

  The three class trees of Might, Finesse, and Sorcery are pretty unique, and most people agree that the optimal way to build up the Fateless One's skills. However, there's nothing wrong with multiclassing and enjoying the best of every class tree, especially since the game can become a bit too easy for players who only level up a single tree instead of diversifying.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon's Dogma 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  might have been developed in Japan, but it's clear that this title channels the energy of Western RPGs in its gameplay and aesthetic. The sequel may have launched on a sour note due to some performance issues, but it has slowly won over players as a great sequel that expands on the core gameplay mechanics of the first game.

 <p>
  The best thing about
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  is that every Vocation is a joy to control in battle, finally addressing the struggles of fans who felt that a magic-heavy playthrough in such games felt a bit too passive for their liking. Once players get to mess around with Advanced Vocations, the gameplay of
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  opens up even further and makes every boss encounter a joy to experience.

  <em>
   <strong>
    DayZ

  is one of the most ruthless survival games there is. Its unforgiving weather and status effect system leaves many players feeling trapped in its expansive maps, struggling to make it far out of spawn. To combat this struggle, players will need to find food, a water source, and various must-have items to guarantee survival.
  <strong>
   Rope
  </strong>
  is one of these items.

  Rope is one of the most versatile early-game Crafting items in
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  . It is used to create things like Improvised Backpacks and Fishing Poles, which are imperative to surviving the difficult early-game survival stage. Luckily, there are a few simple ways to craft it from the inventory.

  Rope in
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  can be crafted using two quick methods, in addition to finding it randomly across various maps. Both methods require a knife or a sharp tool, such as a handsaw. Before attempting to craft rope, players must ensure they have a suitable sharp tool to cut the necessary materials.

  How to craft Rope with Rags in DayZ
 </h3>
 <p>
  The easiest way to craft rope in
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  is by
  <strong>
   combining two stacks of six Rags
  </strong>
  . First, use a knife or another sharp tool to cut up clothing items found throughout the map. With the knife in hand, hover over a clothing item to cut it into rags. Once twelve Rags have been collected, place one stack of six in the hand slot, and the option to combine them into rope will appear.

  How to craft Rope with Guts in DayZ

 <p>
  Another way to craft rope in
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  is by using guts. Place the Guts in hand, combine them with a knife, and the option to craft rope will appear. Although the process is straightforward, acquiring guts may be more challenging for newer
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  players, as it requires killing and skinning an animal or another player with a knife. Guts can also be found in the inventory of dead Infected, so make sure to search the dead.

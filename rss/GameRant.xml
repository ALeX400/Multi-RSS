      Survival horror games rely on more than jump scares, pitting a (usually) rather helpless protagonist against an overwhelming evil.
     </li>
     <li>
      Throughout the years, many near-genre-defining survival horror titles have been released, from Silent Hill 2 to Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
     </li>
     <li>
      The following games remain the greatest pillars of survival horror, with some of the eeriest atmospheres and thrilling gameplay.

  A
  <strong>
   good survival horror game
  </strong>
  is often a mixture of good stories and bone-chilling moments. It doesn't rely only on cheap jumpscares but develops interesting and terrifying monsters that hunt down the main character. With horror being such a big franchise, it's not often that people see an excellent title put out on the market. That being said, if players are survival horror fanatics and are looking to play something new, there are many candidates who more than fit the bill in this regard.

 <p>
  Many games have left a lasting impression in the genre in the past years and will continue to define survival horror for decades to come. Whether it's because of their intense resource management, tense combat, nerve-wracking story, or a combination of all three, there's no denying that the best survival horror games around let players experience a feeling that makes every small victory as satisfying as can be while trying to deal with a wealth of horrifying humans and monsters.

   The survival experience in games is usually coupled with the fear of running out of resources, which already makes it a horrifying adventure, but some games take one step further and offer even more horror elements through environment and storytelling.

 <p>
  While most survival horror games are linear experiences with an extra focus on the story and narrative, there have been some great open-world games in the same genre as well in the past years, which allow players to use their creativity in overcoming the challenges and terrors of creepy worlds.

  Unlike most other horror games that try to imply fear with jumpscares or eerie sounds,
  <em>
   Barotruama
  </em>
  creates a heavily dark environment in deep space, where the player's only hope for survival is their submarine, but as long as it operates properly.

 <p>
  Playable in solo and co-op modes,
  <em>
   Barotrauma
  </em>
  tasks players with operating the submarine under any condition, while facing space monsters and challenging situations. Players will always need to deal with the fear of losing the submarine, which is why they have to master their skills in managing the resources and fixing the submarine's problem one by one, before they are exposed to mutated creatures.

  Thanks to its VR support,
  <em>
   Phosmophobia
  </em>
  is an ultimate experience for anyone who wants to feel the sense of fear deep within. Similar to
  <em>
   Barotrauma
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Phsamophobia
  </em>
  also supports online co-op mode, which allows players to explore the horrific world of the game together!

 <p>
  <em>
   Phasmophbia
  </em>
  revolves around hunting ghosts with a theme similar to The Exorcist movie. Players are ghost hunters, and they need to use all the tools and devices at their disposal to find the source of paranormal activity, but it is not going to be easy to face these otherworldly beings.

  Both
  <em>

  and its sequel,
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  , deliver a superb survival experience on an open-world island, where players can build their own bases, though it is not about living a happy life there! Both games follow a crash onto an unknown island, where life looks much different from the rest of the world.

  The survival elements are quite bold in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  series, as players need to find food and water, craft weapons, and build safe bases where they could rest for a single night at least. However, the island is inhabited by a cannibal tribe, who will raid players at night. Exploring
  <em>
   The Forest's
  </em>
  world during nighttime and sneaking inside caves full of cannibals could be among every gamer's most horrifying experiences ever.

  <em>
   Haunting Ground
  </em>
  is easily one of the most underappreciated survival horror games of all time, channeling the pursuit energy of
  <em>
   Clock Tower
  </em>
  with a fresh coat of paint that makes this title such an unnerving experience from start to end. Fiona is a pretty engaging protagonist, even if her use as fanservice can be rather harrowing to watch given the gruesome subject matter of this game.

  Thankfully, players aren't completely alone as they deal with the many pursuers who are trying to chase her down for their nefarious purposes. They have a dog called Hewie who aids Fiona every step of the way, allowing her to secure some much-needed items and have some sort of protection against her pursuers whenever Hewie tries to protect her by biting her enemies.

  While many horror games today opt for a first-person perspective,
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  is a throwback to the days when games like
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  dominated with their classic third-person perspective.
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  puts us in the shoes of a detective who's desperately trying to solve a mass murder.

  During his investigation, he's transported into an otherworldly place filled with terrifying monsters. With the original creator of the
  <em>
   Resident Evil

  series as one of the primary developers, players can expect a haunting survival story full of horrors and scares.

  For those who love shaping their own story,
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  is one of the greatest survival horror games. It's set up like a classic slasher horror film, where multiple characters must try to survive the horrors that haunt them. As players control numerous characters in different scenes, they'll need to collect clues to help them move forward.

  Sometimes, players will make decisions and find items that will affect the future, providing them with a brief vision of the future. This will help them make the right choices when the time is right. Players should keep in mind that, for everyone to survive, every detail must fall perfectly in place.

  There's no question that
  <em>
   The Last Of Us
  </em>
  is one of the best games of the last twenty years. While it would take forever to elaborate why, it's better to experience the game firsthand. If players haven't already ventured into the zombie apocalypse as Joel and Ellie, then it's strongly recommended that they get around to it.

  <em>

  There's no horror movie quite like the original
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  , which is why
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  became such a popular title. Its aesthetics are inspired by the first movie, and the game transports us back to a time shortly after the Nostromo's fall when Amanda Ripley is struggling to find out what happened to her mother.

  Controlling an FBI agent who is trying to discover the source of the mysterious killings that have been taking place in the city of Metro makes for a great time as players slowly uncover the depths of a truly nightmarish controversy. It doesn't help that the protagonist, Ethan Thomas, is framed for these murders, causing him to battle friend and foe alike in a bid to reach the truth and clear his name in the process.

  is a typical survival horror in the sense that players get no weapons to help them on their way. Stealth and wits will get them far against even the most ferocious and fast-moving enemies. The game is extremely imaginative in its aesthetics, and its story is guaranteed to leave players feeling emotional and in awe of just how brilliant the writing is.

  Many survival horror games take place in the future, but
  <em>
   Amnesia: The Dark Descent
  </em>
  went a vastly different route. In the 1830s, Daniel wakes up with severe amnesia inside a castle he hardly remembers getting himself into. Hunted down by terrifying monsters, he needs to find a way to remember the past.

  This game was a massive success upon its release, due to its incredible stealth and sanity mechanics, which would force players to be sparing with their lantern oil. Moreover, it had one of the most complex and interesting storylines, which combined historical themes with science fiction.

  After languishing in mediocrity for some time since
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  fans of the series were finally graced with a brand-new direction for the series that focused on a first-person perspective and tackled new and fresh events. The end result was
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
  </em>
  , which is as harrowing as most players would assume as they step into the shoes of Ethan Winters and try to bring her wife back after things go south.

 <p>
  Not only did the series manage to bring back the brutality of a zombie apocalypse with Ethan's storyline, but it also achieved even greater success by remaking older fan-favorite entries, adding more survival-horror flavor to them with the new tech. Resident Evil 4 Remake is a great example of how the survival horror genre can tell deep stories while featuring solid gameplay mechanics.

  Many games have tried to do what
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  accomplished with sci-fi horror but in vain. With a wide arsenal of weapons, it's one of the more action-heavy survival horror games, but its incredible design and popularity are undeniable. The remake does a great job of making this title more detailed, visually astounding, and horrifying in its own right. The fact that Isaac finally speaks is a bonus too.

  The amazing atmosphere of
  <em>
   System Shock 2,
  </em>
  coupled with its immersive sim, makes it arguably the best survival horror title of all time. There's a reason why SHODAN is one of the most iconic video game villains.

  Controlling the unnamed hacker and exploring the desolate halls of the Von Braun makes for a harrowing time, with players looking over their shoulders every step of the way. The aggressive spawning of enemies means that players can't linger in areas for too long, which adds to the rampant tension.

  Legendary Olympic athlete Michael Phelps is known for being the most successful Olympian of all time, with a staggering 28 gold and numerous other medals to match. However, Phelps is less known for starring in his own video game titled
  <em>
   Michael Phelps: Push the Limit.
  </em>

 <p>
  A swimming simulation game at its heart,
  <em>
   Push the Limit
  </em>
  was released on the Xbox 360 in 2011. While not particularly popular among critics orfans, the game featured connectivity with the Xbox Kinect, allowing players to control Michael Phelps's swimming action through motion control. Though it was a novel feature at most, the realistic swimming gameplay of
  <em>
   Push the Limit
  </em>
  never quite hit the stardom of its Olympic namesake.

  While Phelps is the most successful Olympian, Usain Bolt is arguably the most iconic. Known for being the fastest man in history with a 100m sprint time of 9.58 seconds, Bolt is also fond of video games such as
  <em>
   Mario Kart.
  </em>
  The world's fastest man has also starred in a few gaming titles.

  The popular indie sports game
  <em>
   Bolt
  </em>
  is one examplse, with player taking control of a miniature Usain Bolt, jumping over hurdles, and collecting items characteristic of endless runners. Similarly, the prolific runner also had a feature in the great coop sports game
  <em>
   Pro Evolution Soccer 18,
  </em>
  with football fanatics able to play 'the most beautiful game' as Bolt and compete against the world's best footballers.

  Roger Federer, the king of the court and now-retired tennis hero, is known for his stints at several Olympic Games throughout his career. Despite achievements in Olympic doubles (winning a gold medal), Federer never won a singles gold medal at the Olympics, losing to British player Andy Murray in the 2012 London Olympic Games.

  Famed Olympic and world champion pole vaulter Sergei Bubka has set numerous records as a prevalent force in pole jumping. The first athlete in history to achieve a vault of 6 meters in 1985, Sergei Bubka doesn't seem to be a ikely candidate to have his own video game. However, Bubka got prime time with
  <em>
   Sergei Bubka's Millennium Games
  </em>
  , released in 2000.

 <p>
  A mishmash of different track-based events, such as the 800m and 100m sprint, the game lets players take control of athletes, coaches, and national teams in competition across numerous events. While seemingly a knock-off of the Olympic Games video game series,
  <em>
   Millennium Games
  </em>
  is a capable sports game supported by Sergei Bubka in a bizarre but endearing entry to the sports video game genre.

  Considered one of the best track and field athletes of all time, Carl Lewis won nine gold medals across his decorated career in events such as the 100m and the long jump. A multidisciplinary athlete and an Olympic legend, Lewis was the namesake of video game titles such as
  <em>
   The Carl Lewis Challenge,
  </em>
  released on PC in 1992 and later

   Carl Lewis Athletics 2000

  <strong>
   Elden Ring
  </strong>
  features numerous status effects that can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Proccing bleed on an enemy removes a significant portion of their health, sleep renders an enemy vulnerable to attacks, and Scarlet Rot causes enemies to lose significant HP over time, among others. Most status effects are powerful and can trivialize boss fights. However, some, like Madness and Death Blight, have very niche uses and are effective primarily in PvP scenarios, and rarely in PvE.

  While Death Blight only works against Tarnished enemies, Madness finds its purpose through its raw damage output rather than status build-up. Madness builds are generally avoided in PvE because most enemies are immune to the Madness effect. However, since Madness weapons and spells deal Fire damage, you can create
  <strong>
   a powerful Madness build in

  by defeating Festering Fingerprint Vyke on the way to the Church of Inhibition in northeast Liurnia. As a great spear, this weapon has an excellent moveset, perfect for chasing down enemies in PvP or performing safe thrust attacks in PvE. In addition to its innate Madness build-up, Vyke’s War Spear has a powerful Ash of War that ignites the ground with the Flames of Frenzy.

   Madding Hand

  . This fist weapon has a fast moveset that helps you build Madness rapidly on enemies vulnerable to it. Additionally, the Madding Hand gives a slight attack boost when Madness occurs nearby. While the weapon itself isn’t particularly impressive, it can be used to gain a little extra damage output.

   Erdtree Seal

  is the best Sacred Seal for a Madness build. If you plan to focus solely on spells, it’s also recommended to use the Frenzied Flame Seal in your off-hand for an extra damage bonus to Madness incantations.

  Frenzied Flame is one of the most powerful spell classes in
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  . Nearly all incantations belonging to Frenzied Flame are strong and effective. The only downside of using them is the Madness build-up on the caster. Here are the best Frenzied Flame incantations to include in a Madness build:

    Howl of Shabriri
   </span>
   : One of the best buffs in
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
   , Howl of Shabriri increases damage by 25% but causes you to take increased damage and attract enemy aggression. Since it’s a body buff, you can stack Howl of Shabriri with an aura buff like Golden Vow. This spell can be obtained from a chest atop the Frenzy-Flaming Tower in northeast Liurnia.

    The Flame of Frenzy
   </span>
   : Arguably the strongest Madness incantation, The Flame of Frenzy can be collected from Callu Baptismal Church in Weeping Peninsula without having to fight any enemies. It also has a low requirement of 16 Faith, allowing Prophet-class characters to cast it without leveling up. It can be charged and cast until the Madness effect triggers. With the right build, you’ll likely kill the enemy before Madness procs.

    Frenzied Burst

   : The long-range attack of a Madness build. It shoots a beam of Frenzied Flame that can travel surprisingly long distances. Charging the spell will increase damage and cause the beam to travel faster. You’ll find this spell inside a scarab on the way to the Church of Inhibition.

    Unendurable Frenzy
   </span>
   : This is an endgame spell obtainable only after reaching the Consecrated Snowfield. It is found inside a chest located in Yelough Anix Ruins. Although it’s available late in the game, Unendurable Frenzy is outpowered by The Flame of Frenzy. The only advantage of using Unendurable Frenzy is that it can be cast continuously until you run out of FP or get inflicted with Madness.

   Inescapable Frenzy

  and Midra’s Flame of Frenzy. Inescapable Frenzy is a lethal spell but only works against Tarnished enemies at a very close range. Even in PvP fights, landing Inescapable Frenzy on a player is nearly impossible. However, you can use it against PvE Tarnished enemies to easily cheese them.

   Midra's Flame of Frenzy
  </span>
  , it’s a DLC-exclusive spell available by exchanging the Remembrance of the Lord of Frenzied Flame. This spell requires two slots and has a higher Madness build-up compared to other Frenzied Flame incantations, and it is not a particularly powerful spell overall for its FP and spell slot cost. The Greatsword of Damnation is a much better choice than Midra’s Flame of Frenzy when exchanging the Rememberance of the Lord of Frenzied Flame.

  When it comes to armor, most builds offer flexible options, allowing the wearer to choose their own fashion. However, Madness build enthusiasts need to be cautious when selecting an armor set, as you need high Focus to slow down Madness build-up. Here are some armor recommendations featuring high Focus stats:

   <strong>
    (DLC exclusive)

   : This armor set is a reward for defeating the Blackgaol Knight found in the Western Nameless Mausoleum. You can obtain this armor set quite early in the DLC, as the Western Nameless Mausoleum is in Gravesite Plain near the start of

  There are many strong talismans to use in a Madness build in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Ideally, you want a mix of both offensive and defensive talismans to carry against mighty enemies. If you’re confident in your dodging skills, feel free to use only offensive talismans:

    Shard of Alexander

   : This talisman is recommended for players using Vyke’s War Spear in their Madness build. Since you’ll be using this weapon’s Ash of War frequently, the extra damage from the Shard of Alexander makes a significant difference.

    Flock's Canvas Talisman
   </span>
   : While you need to progress through Gowry’s questline to obtain Flock’s Canvas Talisman, it’s worth having for incantation builds. In Madness builds, your main source of damage comes from spells like The Flame of Frenzy and Frenzied Burst. This talisman boosts damage from all incantations by 8%.

    Radagon Icon

   : One of the common issues with many incantations is their long animations. Fortunately, the Radagon Icon reduces spell casting time by providing virtual Dexterity points. Players who find Frenzied Flame incantations slow to cast will benefit from the Radagon Icon talisman.

  Since all Frenzied Flame incantations require Faith, the Prophet starting class is the best choice for a Madness build in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This class starts with 16 Faith, which allows you to use The Flame of Frenzy spell immediately. As for the stats, your primary focus should be on increasing Faith to meet the requirements for all other Frenzied Flame incantations. However, make sure to also level up Vigor and Mind along the way. Here’s a level 125 Madness build recommendation using the Erdtree Seal along with Vyke’s War Spear:

 <p>
  If you want to deal more damage with Vyke’s War Spear, invest points into Dexterity instead of Faith. For a spell-focused build, prioritize Faith, Mind, and Vigor.

  Once you’ve completed your Madness build, you’ll need to decide on buffs for the build. Madness builds already have an excellent buff in Howl of Shabriri. You can stack it with Golden Vow, Aged One’s Exultation, and

  Two teams of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have decided to kill time during a server crash by making a massive human tower.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has had multiple server downtimes since its release, but this may be the most memorable way players have spent an outage.

 <p>
  Due to its live service nature, Blizzard has to take
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  offline for maintenance, content updates, and more. The ongoing requirement for players to have access to the internet may also affect gamers with an unreliable connection. While the community can expect such outages ahead of seasonal releases, the game is sometimes unintentionally inaccessible. Beyond these offline moments, the game may also run into hiccups that cause the game to crash for all players in a match. This typically results in a lobby where players can still freely move around, but cannot progress through a match. One set of players recently encountered a crash like this, and they spent the downtime making a massive human tower.

  Reddit user Imjustabananaa recently shared an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  clip in which both teams in a match work together toward a common goal. According to the Reddit user, the server their match was on seemed to stop working, causing both teams to work together to create a human tower as they anticipated a resolution to their server woes. When the clip starts, D.Va, Doomfist, Pharah, Lifeweaver, Baptiste, Ashe, and a second Lifeweaver are all stacked on each other. The enemy Baptiste then uses his Exo Boots to reach the top of the tower before their allied Pharah is boosted up by Lifeweaver's Petal Platform. With
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Pharah unable to stand on top of Baptiste, the human tower is completed by Echo who then aims the camera downward to highlight the tower from above.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  features a 5v5 player-versus-player composition, the maximum height of this human tower is ten players. Given that Pharah never made it to the top of the tower before the video concluded, the human tower was capped at nine players. This video highlights one of the rare opportunities in which players on both sides work towards the same objective. Although Pharah inadvertently shot at Echo when trying to reach the top of the tower, none of them tried to defeat each other. While this type of thing could happen during a standard
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  match, it's rare that both teams would remain so coordinated and friendly under normal circumstances.

  Given that this experiment could've been ruined by one rogue player, it's impressive that the human tower was able to incorporate both teams. Most of the characters in the human tower have movement-based abilities that may have benefited their placement in it. Out of all these heroes,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Ashe likely had the hardest time reaching her position near the top of the stack.

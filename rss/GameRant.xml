      <title>Final Fantasy: 6 Games With The Best Summon Systems, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  Summons are one of the most iconic things that appear in most
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games including spinoffs. They were first introduced in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 3
  </em>
  in 1990 on the NES which is also the first game to introduce an interchangeable Job system for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  . North America would not get to experience
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 3
  </em>
  until the DS remake came out in 2006.

  As for Summons, North American players would experience them in 1994 with
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  which was coincidentally renamed
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 3
  </em>
  on the SNES. Confusing names aside, again, Summons is a cool part of any game in this series. Some entries have integrated Summons into their gameplay mechanics better than others, so here are some top examples ranked appropriately.

  Summons are called Espers and they are tied to the Zodiac signs. Zodiacs play a big part in the Ivalice games like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12
  </em>
  . Through the story, players can unlock new Espers and in battle, characters can summon them to their side temporarily.

  The other two party members will be replaced and only the summoner and the Esper will remain. For example, the main character Vaan can summon Belias, and the two can pal around together to fight monsters. Their time will be short, but if players use their summoned creature effectively, then they can get through any tough situation.

  introduced Materia to the series. These crystallized orbs contained passive abilities like HP+, spells like Fire, and even summonable creatures called Summons like Ifrit. In the first remake, most Summons could be rewarded through VR-simulated battles.

 <p>
  In the follow-up,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , players could find relics of Summons in the lands they traveled to. One of the NPCs, Chadley, would then convert discovered data into VR battles so that players could get a piece of Materia after they were victorious in battle. For example, the Summon of the Cosmo Canyon region was Bahamut Arisen. Once summoned in battle, these creatures would fight alongside the whole party and they could be issued commands along with following a basic AI set of abilities.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12

  ,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6â€™s

  Summons were called Espers. When a new one was acquired, a character could equip it and then use it in battle for a random effect.

  Shiva, for example, would attack all enemies with ice as she always does in these games. Besides their use in battle, characters could learn magic from Espers. Once learned, characters would know these spells forever which was a unique way of using Summons up to this point.

  This game has a completely unique name for their Summons which had never been replicated. Guardian Forces, or GFs, were obtained through
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8â€™s
  </em>
  story and optional boss battles. The first one players could acquire was Ifrit. Once obtained, players could link that GF to a character and then equip unlocked commands to that character.

 <p>
  For example, the universal command each GF dished out was called Draw. Characters could absorb magic through this command from monsters to use in battle or they could equip spells to stats linked to their GFs like Strength. It was a wild system at the time and it is still odd now, but that doesnâ€™t mean it was bad. Quite the contrary, as the GFs were an interesting way to handle equipment, magic, and Summons all tied to one system.

  <em>

  was a big upgrade for the series in many ways from the graphical upgrade on the PS2 from the PS1 to the voice acting. Summons got a big boost too, called Aeons, as they were directly tied to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10â€™s
  </em>
  story which was not new but it was still a different approach. Yuna was a Summoner who had to go on a pilgrimage to get as many Aeons as possible to battle a world-destroying creature named Sin.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1058} -->

 <p>
  While characters could share skills via the leveling-up system called the Sphere Grid, only Yuna could summon Aeons. When she did, the rest of the party would be replaced and players could then only issue commands for this Aeon until they called it back or it died. Even after an Aeon died, Yuna could summon another one onto the battlefield from classics like Bahamut to oddities like Yojimbo. It is kind of like the Esper system from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12,
  </em>
  but Yunaâ€™s close bond with these Aeons makes it stick out more as if she were a Pokemon Trainer.

  was a divisive entry but one thing no one can argue with is how it elevated Summons for the series. In the game, nations had champions called Dominants who carried the souls of Summons within their bodies called Eikons. The main character, Clive, was the Dominant for the Eikon Ifrit, for example. Clive could also absorb the powers from other Dominants to gain their powers from linked weapons to spells thus opening up a variety of skill trees.

  This was a cool system for leveling up but the main draw of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  was the Eikon boss encounters which played out like giant Kaiju battles. This put players in the role of Ifrit to tear through other gigantic Eikons. There were some other surprises too but that would require more spoilers. Itâ€™s hard to tell if Summons will or could ever get this epic again from a gameplay angle.

  The highly anticipated follow-up to one of the best Theme Park simulator games of all time is right around the corner. Frontier Developments'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Planet Coaster 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is just about to launch at a time with few games that can stand up to the customizability and mechanics of the original
  <em>
   Planet Coaster
  </em>
  , and it won't be long until you can get your hands on it.

  But depending on where you live, you may have to wait "longer" to start customizing your park in
  <em>
   Planet Coaster 2,
  </em>
  as the launch day for

  in your region may differ from others. Though the game comes out at the same time globally, this guide explains exactly when you can expect
  <em>

      <title>Hogwarts Legacy: Best Ron Weasley Build</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There may be many years between
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  and the start of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  story, but there are plenty of ways for players to make connections between those two eras. This includes trying to recreate some iconic characters from the beloved books and movies. Ron Weasley is one such character that fans are surely looking to mold their character after. While players can meet one of Ron's distant relatives in the form of one of the school's professors in the game, they can also bring the red-headed firecracker to life, albeit not exactly perfectly.
 </p>

 <p>
  Players can get the look of their character rather close, and can certainly get his House and spell style correct. It really isn't that complicated either, as fans already know so much about the character: he's a fiercely loyal friend (
  <em>
   Goblet of Fire
  </em>
  excluded) and, despite his occasional mistakes
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  always does his best to do right by his friends and family. He's known for his bright red hair, his freckles, and his messy, but powerful enough, abilities with magic. To bring this character to the popular game, players only need to follow this guide right here.

  The first part of creating Ron Weasley in

  is to
  <strong>
   nail down the iconic look of the character
  </strong>
  . This can be done with the following values in the character creation section at the beginning of the game:

  Finally,
  <strong>
   choose the Wizard dormitory

  <strong>
   to select Gryffindor

  , where all the Weasleys have been, including Ron.

 <p>
  In terms of actually roleplaying, Ron wasn't ever known for his effectiveness with spells like Expelliarmus or Accio. He was always more of a loose cannon, so players should stick with the
  <strong>
   more bombastic spells like Bombarda, Incendio, and Confringo
  </strong>
  .

  Also, the only Unforgivable Curse that Ron would use
  <strong>
   is the Imperius Curse
  </strong>
  on occasion. He would never use Crucio or Avada Kedavra; that's not what a Gryffindor does.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Horizon Zero Dawn
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a thrilling adventure from start to finish â€” most of the time, that is. Like many open-world games, there are downtimes. In this game, some of those downtimes come from hunting, which is necessary for upgrading your gear.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, not all hunting is engaging or enjoyable. For instance, hunting rats can be more annoying than fun, yet you still need to do it to enhance your character's arsenal. The guide below provides details on
  <strong>
   where to find several Rats
  </strong>
  and how to farm them for the resources you need, so you wonâ€™t have to search for them ever again.

 <p>
  Rats are surprisingly tricky to hunt in
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  â€” not because theyâ€™re tough, but because theyâ€™re so small and quick that tracking them down can be a hassle. Hunting them feels like a game of Tom and Jerry, and their spawn points are also less common than those of other animals like Boars and Foxes.

 <p>
  For consistent rat farming, head to a familiar spot: the
  <strong>
   Ruins just to the right of Mother's Watch
  </strong>
  . This is the same location Aloy explored as a child at the start of the game. Once you reach the bottom of the Ruins, draw your bow and get ready â€” plenty of rats will spawn here, so keep hunting until youâ€™ve gathered all the Rat Bones and Skins you need.

  Like other animal resources,
  <strong>
   Rat Bone is an uncommon item, while Rat Skin is rare

  , so you may need to farm a few extra rats to collect enough skins. Fortunately, you wonâ€™t need many to craft everything. In total, youâ€™ll need 4 Rat Bones and 3 Rat Skins (4 Skins if playing NG+ or 5 if playing NG+ on Ultra Hard).

 <p>
  You might find it hard to spot a wild Ditto, but the developers at Niantic have provided ways to pinpoint it in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . There are only a few monsters that Ditto can copy, but the potential disguises change occasionally. You must first figure out which monsters Ditto can disguise and look for them in the wild; there is a chance that one of them will be Ditto or Shiny Ditto. That said, this guide details all the Ditto disguises for November 2024.

  Niantic changes the Ditto disguises now and then. Currently, there are multiple monsters Ditto can copy for November 2024. Although there is no guarantee, lucky
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers may also encounter a Shiny Ditto. You have to
  <strong>
   encounter numerous Ditto to catch up with its Shiny odds
  </strong>
  . Here are all the possible picks.

 <p>
  While catching a Ditto is already a 1 in 50 chance, players can increase their odds by encountering as many pocket monsters as possible. The best way to do this is to use
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Lure Modules or an Incense in a PokeStop or Gym. These items increase the number of Pokemon that appear on the world map, meaning more encounters and chances to find a Ditto.

 <p>
  One can also use the in-game item Incense and the Weather Boost function. Since its spawn rate gets boosted in partly cloudy weather, attach a Lure Module to a
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  PokeStop or Gym with such weather condition, activate an Incense, and walk around that area.

 <p>
  It's also worth utilizing the Daily Adventure Incense, an item granted once daily that is active for 15 minutes and attracts Pokemon that aren't normally found in the wild. As long as the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  player keeps moving, Pokemon will continue to spawn for 15 minutes, occasionally leading to some rare catches.

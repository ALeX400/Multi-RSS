   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a farming sim that allows players to own their very own farm and customize its look. With each update from developer ConcernedApe, the customization for the game continues to grow. Whether that be cats wearing hats or players finally being able to move their houses to whatever location they desire, players love the attention to detail.

  Players will find themselves having a lot of materials throughout the game. These come in handy for a variety of things, such as crafting or giving to other villagers who might need them. Players will want to make sure they are stocked up on materials or ingredients to be able to craft items for their farm or prepare food for themselves or their family. To store these items, players can craft Chests, and change the color of these containers to suit their style.

  Players will first need to craft themselves a chest. This can be found in the inventory menu and will require 50 Wood to make. Once players have made a chest, they can place it down wherever they like, inside or outside. You can then open it and place items from your inventory into the chest.

 <p>
  The way to change the color of the chest is pretty simple. Just look to the side of the screen, where you will see a little block with a bunch of colors. It is the very top small button on the right of the screen. Clicking on it, you will see a new menu open at the top with a bunch of different color choices. This is where players can choose the color they wish their chest to be.

 <p>
  After clicking on one of the colors, players can then see their chest has changed colors. This is a great way to organize items and materials even better with the color coding organizing trick. That is everything to know about changing the color of chest in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>
  It is a pretty easy process that can be completed with each chest that a player crafts.

  Golden Crowns are a currency in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hades 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Players will be able to exchange gold crowns during the night for various things from Charon, such as boons or perhaps a Soul Tonic, among others.

 <p>
  Any unused Golden Crowns each night will, however, vanish, so the player should make sure to spend them all that night, as hoarding them is useless. Here are some good ways to make a quick buck in
  <em>
   Hades 2.

 <p>
  Of course, this one might be obvious, but the best way to gather a large amount of gold is to pursue encounters that have a gold Crown on their entrance. By entering into these encounters, the player will first have to defeat a horde of enemies but will receive a handsome amount of gold.

 <p>
  However, this might not be the best way to get gold, as entering a location with a golden crown as a reward could mean having to give up better things, such as boons.

  Golden Urns is a good way to make some quick money in
  <em>
   Hades 2.
  </em>
  These urns will appear frequently, almost in every encounter the player faces. To get the money out of the urns, the player will have to hit it with an attack to break it open. The amount the player gets depends on each urn, but they can expect at least 5 golden urns, possibly going up to 15.

 <p>
  To unlock Golden Urns, the player must make use of an Incantation. This incantation is known as
  <em>
   “Propensity Toward Gold”.

  The Gold Purse is a keepsake that will help the player get richer every night. To unlock this keepsake, the player will have to offer Charon a gift of Nectar. This item is similar to the Chthonic Coin Purse that players could receive in the first Hades game from Hypnos.

  Sunken Treasure is a great way to gain gold during the night. This boon from Poseidon will be very useful as the common version of it will offer 90 golden crowns, and the rarer the boon, the more golden crowns. For example, Epic will grant 144, which is a very high amount and is almost enough to buy certain boons from Charon.

  Ocean’s Bounty is perfect for players looking to get more golden crowns or minor finds, which are Ashes and Psyche. The most common version will offer a reward value of +50%, and the heroic version will offer a reward value of +125% to gold they acquire. So in the worst scenario, if the player finds 100 gold crows and has the common version of this boon, they’ll instead get 150.

  Just like Atrophic Affluence, this can be a bit randomized, but the reward is an increase in the worth of gold crowns found. To earn this gold increase, the player must be quick and clear a certain amount of encounters in a set amount of time. Otherwise, they will lose a lot of HP, which is possibly a game-ender. This boon is very high risk and shouldn’t be taken lightly.

  Medea is an easy-to-miss character that appears in
  <em>
   Hades 2.
  </em>
  An interesting boon she offers that could potentially make the player some money is Wealth from the Dead. This boon will grant the player a 10% chance to have a slain enemy drop an extra 20 gold crowns. However, that is only 2 enemies per encounter. If the player is facing a large group of enemies, it’s very likely they will be able to defeat two foes that will drop extra money.

  Narcissus can be encountered in Oceanus when the player goes through an entrance with hands-on. He offers a lot of interesting rewards with his boons. The one players going for gold crowns should go for is Precious Metals. It will immediately grant the player 100 gold crowns, and not only that, but also 6 silver, which can be quite useful.

  A tech-savvy
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  player has created an impressive in-game light show. Every day,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players showcase incredible projects made with the game's resources. There are builds that recreate locations from real life, games, or anime, clever ideas for contraptions, and mods that expand the possibilities of what to do in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  in a way that a player is unlikely to get bored.

 <p>
  The most common way for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players to inject new content and features into the sandbox is by creating mods. Some pay tribute to famous games, bringing the popular Backrooms to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  or recreating a part of
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  in Mojang's sandbox. Other mods add new features such as blocks, tools, and new mobs.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players have a remarkable creativity for inventing new ways to entertain themselves, as one player recently showed by sharing an impressive project.

 <p>
  Reddit user MrAdrien79 has made an incredible light show inside
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . The almost three-minute video shows a light show with white and blue forms, and others similar to lasers. The creative
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  project displays lights in the form of triangles and colored cubes, creating an eye-catching result when combined with more traditional lights. The player, who is a Java developer, explains in the comments that they have created a mod to make the light show but notes that it is not available for download. To animate the timeline of the light show, they used Blender, a popular 3D content creation software, and exported the timeline script to be loaded by their mod.

  Other
  <em>

  </em>
  players praised MrAdrien79's project in the comments section, sharing excitement about the potential of the player's idea. Some Redditors suggested they host an online event with the light show and create a rave for other
  <em>

  </em>
  players. Others gave a more humorous idea and suggested the OP keep PvP active and create a moshpit. A third Redditor expressed their desire to see a concert in

  or making mods of all kinds.

  follows players as they exit Vault 76 and learn to survive in the new world that is Appalachia after the Great War. It takes place 25 years after the bombs dropped, and players get a chance to see the effects firsthand. The region has been devastated by the nuclear fallout from the war, and players will need to work together to rebuild life.

  One thing that players can do is create a C.A.M.P., which will allow them to make their own place in the world. They will be able to build buildings, shelters, and so much more. With the free cam option, players can build these areas so much easier, making the game even better than before. Here's a breakdown of what the free cam is and how to access it.

 <p>
  One of the biggest complaints from fans of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  was that it was difficult to build in their C.A.M.P., which made creating the perfect area extremely difficult for players. To address this, Bethesda added a quality-of-life feature known as the free cam during the Nuka World on Tour update. This feature allows players to move the camera around freely while they are building in their areas.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":999} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The camera can be moved around the area players are building in, meaning that players can keep their character in one place and still build and craft items. This eliminates the need to move around and try to place objects while moving the character. It also allows for much more customization when building since players aren't restricted by player movement.

  Thankfully, the free cam is extremely useful and easy to access, which is perfect for players who want to build around their area easily. To access it, players need to open the crafting menu while inside their C.A.M.P. From there, they will see the option at the bottom of the screen, usually pretty close to the center of the screen, labeled "Toggle Camera."

 <p>
  Toggling this will allow players to access the free cam, letting them easily interact with items and move them around by editing their location or height. They can also see more of their area at one time, allowing them to see how it looks overall rather than being restricted to the point-of-view of their character.

  Given how important exploration is, it is quite easy to run out of stamina. Everything from climbing to combat to gliding across the map consumes stamina, and even two extra vessels of the stat can often feel inadequate. Thanks to the brilliant cooking options available, there are some great stamina-healing recipes in

   It's been highly debated among Zelda players whether the stamina limits placed on Link are needed. On one hand, they provide a realistic obstacle for Link to consider during his travels, but on the other, they can be deeply frustrating. There's few things more upsetting than spending ages climbing up an incline only to realize that Link's stamina will run out before he reaches the top. Toppling from a height, or huffing and puffing after running through a field, isn't exactly a player's idea of fun.

  That said, Breath of the Wild doesn't use this mechanic to punish players. In fact, it inspires creative solutions and also prompts Link to start exploring different recipes that can aid him in his adventures. There are a huge number of dishes in Breath of the Wild that specifically restore and increase stamina, and Link can quickly chow down if he needs to sprint away from an enemy or scale a great mountain. It's safe to say that keeping a few stamina restoring dishes on hand will be instrumental in keeping players calm and collected, and saving Link from a devastating fall. With that in mind, a few more stamina-restoring dishes are now included on this list to help players keep Link's energy up.

  For anyone about to undertake a grueling period of intense exploration,
  <strong>
   Enduring Veggie Cream Soup
  </strong>
  is the perfect dish to have in Link's inventory. This tasty stew will fully restore Link's stamina and provide just over a wheel of temporary stamina in addition. This is perfect for when Link needs to drift long distances with his paraglider, or climb up a particularly steep incline.

 <p>
  This dish has the exact ingredients one would expect: Fresh Milk, Rock Salt, and the right veggie to make this soup energizing. In this case, it would be an Endura Carrot. The more Link adds, the better the restorative properties. To gain the maximum amount, players should use three Endura Carrots, one Fresh Milk, and one Rock Salt.

  One of the staples of any stamina-restoring vegetarian dish will be an Endura Carrot. These brilliant little veggies are the key to keeping Link going even after the most challenging of adventures. Cooking them into any dish is instantly useful, but a
  <strong>
   Vegetable Risotto
  </strong>
  is a dish that truly lets them shine. Endura Carrots can be found near Great Fairy Fountains, and Malanya Spring towards the top of Satori Mountain - likely because the horse god Malanya is waiting for an Endura Carrot offering.

 <p>
  Using two Endura Carrots, one Hylian Rice, one Goat Butter, and one Rock Salt, players can make a tasty veggie rice dish that will fully restore Link's stamina and grant him just under one temporary stamina wheel. It's perfect for a long paragliding session, or if a fight goes poorly and Link needs to make a high-speed dash to safety.

  Glazed Seafood is a surprisingly easy dish to make, as it only has two main ingredients: some sort of fish, and Courser Bee Honey. It's also a great choice when cooking stamina-restoring dishes because players can use four different kinds of fish in order to get
  <strong>
   Energizing Glazed Seafood
  </strong>
  : Staminoka Bass, Bright-Eyed Crabs, Hyrule Bass, and Sanke Carps. Hyrule Bass and Staminoka Bass can be found all around Hyrule (Hyrule Field, West Necluda, Duelling Peaks, etc.), Bright-Eyed Crabs are plentiful in the Zora Domain and around Lanayru, and Snake Carps can be found only in Latern Lake in Kakariko Village.

  In order to make Energized Glazed Seafood, Link should combine four of the above fish and one portion of Courser Bee Honey. It's simple and has a lot of variety, meaning players won't have to spend all their time running around, looking for a specific ingredient. While it doesn't provide any temporary stamina, it'll almost entirely refill Link's stamina, which is ideal when he's halfway up a cliffside.

  Sometimes players don't need a massive amount of stamina restored, and it seems a waste to use one of the better restoration dishes when Link only needs enough to leap up the edge of a cliff. That's where dishes like an

  are the most useful.

  While this dish doesn't restore an impressive amount to Link's stamina wheel, sometimes that's all he needs to get by. It's also very easy to make and only requires Stamella Shrooms and some meat. The more shrooms players add, the more effective the dish will be. Stamella Shrooms can be found growing at the base of trees in forest areas.

  There are all sorts of brilliant and tasty recipes available to cook in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild.
  </em>
  Among those dishes are some delicious desserts, and although Link can bake a standard Carrot Cake to regain some health - adding some Endura Carrots will make this dish replenish his stamina too.

  Combining 1-2 Endura Carrots, Tabantha Wheat, Cane Sugar, and Goat Butter in a cooking pot will produce an
  <strong>
   Enduring Carrot Cake
  </strong>
  , which will fully restore Link's stamina and give him one (and a bit) extra Stamina wheel to allow him to go past his typical limit.

 <p>
  If players are looking to gain back a good amount of hearts as well as a bit of stamina,
  <strong>
   Energizing Mushroom Rice Balls
  </strong>
  are a great choice. Like all recipes, the amount they restore depends on the amount of each ingredient players add before cooking. Mushroom Rice Balls are an incredibly flexible dish that easily has its effects changed based on what ingredients Link decides to add.

 <p>
  To make this tasty dish, all players need are some Stamella Shrooms and Hylian Rice. Adding more than one mushroom will restore more stamina, so players can cook more or less based on how much they think they'll need. It'll also restore about seven hearts in the process, which can be handy if players are climbing away from a battle gone wrong.

 <p>
  For players who are only halfway through a big climb, or desperately trying to run away from something much faster than Link, a quick munch of some
  <strong>
   Energizing Salt-Grilled Crab
  </strong>
  will be clutch.

 <p>
  Once again, the effects will vary based on how many of each ingredient players add. To make this to its full potential, Link will need rock salt, 2 Staminoka Bass, and 2 Bright-Eyed Crabs. This will restore eight hearts, but more importantly, refill three full stamina wheels and keep Link going.

  <strong>
   Energizing Honey Candy
  </strong>
  is a relatively easy recipe that regenerates
  <strong>
   2.8 (two and four-fifths) of Link's stamina vessels.
  </strong>
  The efficacy of this recipe, combined with its ease of use, makes it one of the best foods Link can carry with him for stamina recovery at all times.

 <p>
  To cook the best version of Energizing Honey Candy, players need 5 Courser Bee Honey. Players can find swarms of Courser bees throughout the map of the game, but forests, especially those surrounding Hyrule field, serve as ideal locations. It's also possible to make this dish with 1-4 Courser Bee Honey, but the amount of stamina regained will be greater the more honey is used.

  fully heals stamina in
  <em>

  To cook this meal, all players have to do is

   cook Endura mushrooms in a pot.

  The easiest way to procure Endura shrooms is to buy them from the Hateno village general shop. The more mushrooms used, the more temporary stamina the dish will grant.

  This recipe restores some of Link's stamina vessels while also restoring heart containers. To craft this recipe, players will have to cook
  <strong>
   Staminoka Bass, Bright-Eyed Crab, and Rock Salt
  </strong>
  in a cooking pot. All these items are easy to acquire. Rock Salt can be found by breaking ores, whereas Bright-Eyed Crabs and Staminoka Bass are both abundant around bodies of water.

  As a whole,

   Energizing Salt-Grilled Fish

  is among the game's most versatile foods that are useful for a variety of reasons. Having multiples in stock will be very useful during tough encounters.

  Both these critters can be found in abundance around trees and in areas where wood exists in good quantity. Players may also find them in Beedle's stock.

  Farming Restless Frogs is easy since players will occasionally come across them during their journey in Hyrule. However, the easiest way to acquire these frogs is to purchase them from Beedle, who can be found at Stables throughout the game.

  <strong>
   Enduring Fried Wild Greens
  </strong>
  is a powerful recipe in the game. Not only does this recipe restore several of Link's heart containers, but it also has an enduring effect that fully heals all of his stamina vessels, while providing additional temporary ones.

 <p>
  To create this recipe, players have to

   cook several (up to five) Endura Carrots in a cooking pot.
  </strong>
  Procuring Endura Carrots is super easy in the game. The easiest way players can get them is by purchasing them from the Hateno Village general shop.

  The
  <strong>
   Enduring Meat and Mushroom Skewer
  </strong>
  refills heart containers while fully healing and granting temporary additional stamina vessels. This is another recipe that players can cook during the very start but will take them well into the endgame.

  To cook this recipe, all players have to do is

  <strong>
   Enduring Steamed Mushrooms
  </strong>
  is arguably the best stamina-healing recipe in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild.
  </em>
  Its ease of use, alongside its ability to restore and grant additional stamina vessels, makes it an excellent stamina-restoring food that will come in handy at all times.

 <p>
  To craft this recipe, all players have to do is mix
  <strong>
   Endura Carrots and Endura Shrooms
  </strong>
  in a pot. As mentioned above, both these items are very easy to procure, making this recipe one that players can start crafting from their first hour in the game. Players can acquire both Endura Shrooms and Carrots from the Hateno Village general store.

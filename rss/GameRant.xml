      <title>A Potential Green Lantern Game Could Cover Whatever Ground The HBO Series Doesn’t</title>

 <p>
  After almost five years since its announcement from veteran DC Comics show producer Greg Berlanti, DC’s live-action
  <strong>
   Green Lantern
  </strong>
  series has finally received an official series production order to be released on HBO. Simply called
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  , the eight-episode series will be produced by Chris Mundy and co-written by Damon Lindelof and Tom King. No one has been cast in the series yet and
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  ’ release window is still unknown.

  Despite this lack of detail, King tweeted that he and other members of the
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  crew have been working on the series for over a year. In terms of story,
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  will follow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and John Stewart of Sector 2814 as they take part in an original detective story. However, the Green Lantern mythos is far greater than just Jordan and Stewart; DC Comics could use this opportunity to cover other stories and characters of the Corps that the show doesn’t have time to spotlight in a new
  <em>
   Green Lantern
  </em>
  game.

  The Green Lanterns are an intergalactic police force overseen by the ancient guardians of the universe and based on the planet of Oa. Here, the Guardians crafted the most powerful weapon in the galaxy, the Green Lantern rings, powered by the green light of will from the interdimensional emotional spectrum that makes up all life in existence. At least two rings are sent out to each of the 3600 sectors overseen by the Guardians to select hosts that demonstrate the ability to overcome great fear. Once chosen, these people will be inducted into the Green Lantern Corps to bring justice and order to their sectors, and to the universe at large if necessary.

 <p>
  With the Green Lantern ring, Corps members can create green light constructs of any object or creature limited only to the wielder's imagination. However, these constructs are not all powerful and can be destroyed under immense force, if a ring’s charge is depleted, or if the Lantern is overcome with fear. For most of the Corps’ history, anything yellow colored was immune to Lantern attacks due to an impurity from the Central Power Battery, later revealed to be the entity of fear, Parallax. The rings additionally provide Lantern’s with the ability to travel in space at high speeds and translate any language in the known universe. These powers and goals could provide the base gameplay and objective structure for a hypothetical
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  spinoff game.

  While plot details for
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  are largely unknown, other members of the Corps are unlikely to be heavily focused on with Jordan and Stewart leading an investigation. Instead, the
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  game could highlight the Corps overall, including some important missions and its more notable members. It’s unknown when
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  will take place in the DC timeline, but Earth is home to at least seven active GLs, excluding the magic-powered original Lantern Alan Scott. Guy Gardner is already set to appear in James Gunn’s
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  played by Nathan Fillion, so Gardner could appear as a guide for new players in the Corps alongside the fan-favorite Lantern instructor Kilowog.

 <p>
  If there are other Earth Lanterns beyond Jordan, Stewart, and Gardner, the
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  game could briefly explain how people such as Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jesssica Cruz, or Sojourner Mullein joined the Corps. One of these younger Lanterns could even be the protagonist of the game as they struggle to learn how to be a Lantern and combat galactic foes. Along the way, the player could encounter some of the more bizarre, alien, but often charming members of the Corps, such as the Rot Lop Fan, the squid-like Penelops, or even the living planet Mogo. Each of these characters can teach players new abilities while illustrating how diverse the Corps and the universe at large is.

  Potential Future Lanterns Plotlines
 </h3>
 <p>
  In addition to providing players with unique abilities and lore, the characters of the
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  game could help expand the new DC cinematic universe and future plotlines for the show. For example, if the show’s second season is set primarily in space, various galactic governments and their people could be introduced in the game, such as the galactic Rann-Thanagar War. If Jordan and Stewart’s investigation sets up future conflicts such as the
  <em>
   Sinestro Corps War
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Blackest Night
  </em>
  , DC Comics could further tease these events in a
  <em>
   Lanterns
  </em>
  game by having the
  <strong>
   Green Lantern
  </strong>
  encounter new Corps as both foes and allies or by helping recruit more lanterns to bolster the Corps ranks for an emerging war.

  343 Industries has hired Dan Gniady, previously of Bungie and Creative Assembly, to serve as the new lead designer for the next mainline entry in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  is one of Microsoft's biggest first-party IPs, and while the series was started by Bungie, development duties for the series were taken over by 343 Industries following
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  . The developer is expected to be working on a follow-up to the 2021 title
  <em>
   Halo: Infinite
  </em>
  based on recent teasers from Microsoft and job listings by the developer.

 <p>
  Not much is known about
  <em>
   Halo 7
  </em>
  as it hasn't officially been announced by Microsoft. While
  <em>
   Halo: Infinite
  </em>
  is still being maintained today with the most recent patch being the Tenrai IV Operation update, some fans believe that
  <em>
   Infinite
  </em>
  has been losing steam with each update. With 343 Industries opening some new positions in March, some have speculated that work may have begun on
  <em>
   Halo 7
  </em>
  . These rumors continue to build as Dan Gniady has now been brought on as the next game's designer.

 <p>
  In a video by RebsGaming recapping what is known about
  <em>
   Halo 7
  </em>
  's current development, it was announced that 343 Industries had hired Dan Gniady, with Gniady posting on his LinkedIn page to celebrate the new position. Gniady was previously the lead designer on the canceled
  <em>
   Hyenas
  </em>
  game at Creative Assembly, along with being a gameplay designer at Bungie for a decade. "After speaking with a ton of cool teams about rad projects I’m getting a shot to work with the Chief and friends," Gniady said. "I love
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  and am very excited to be a part of adding to its legacy."

  The only other thing known about the next game is that
  <em>
   Halo 7
  </em>
  will supposedly be built using Unreal Engine based on a job listing from last year. Other details highlighted in RebsGaming's video is how pre-production work was completed between 2022 and 2023, with developers hard at work on the creative direction for future
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  projects, including narrative, characters, and more.

  Microsoft still hasn't officially announced the seventh entry in the mainline

  franchise. There are a few different directions in which the story of
  <em>

  </em>
  could go, with the easiest route being to continue the story started in
  <em>
   Halo: Infinite
  </em>
  . For the time being, fans will need to wait for more official information to be given by 343 Industries or Microsoft about the future of
  <em>

      Street Fighter 6 references the controversy surrounding M. Bison's name in different regions.
     </li>
     <li>
      In the World Tour mode, Bison has a line that alludes to his name being Vega in Japan.
     </li>
     <li>
      M. Bison was originally the name given to Balrog, but the names were changed in the US due to the boxer character's similarity to Mike Tyson.

  The most recent

   <em>
    Street Fighter 6

  </strong>
  DLC finally added the dreaded M. Bison as a playable character, and with him a clever nod to the infamous controversy surrounding his name in different parts of the world. In the base
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , Bison is thought to be dead following his climatic fight against Ryu in the previous entry, with series newcomer JP taking over as master of the sinister Psycho Power and the primary villain that players have to battle against in both the World Tour mode and several Arcade mode playthroughs.

 <p>
  However, it was later revealed that M. Bison isn’t so deceased after all, as the former head of Shadaloo was confirmed to be part of
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  ’s second-year DLC pass during June’s Summer Game Fest livestream. Bison was shown sporting a ragged new look as he rode into the fray on horseback, but gameplay footage showed that he is still as dangerous as ever thanks to his returning Psycho Power-enhanced moveset. Ever since he was added to the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  roster a couple of weeks ago, players could learn to channel these moves by seeking Bison out in World Tour.

  After the player locates M. Bison in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  ’s World Tour mode, they will see that the once-infamous Shadaloo leader has no memory of his past life. During a conversation, Bison will tell the player to call him whatever they would like after going through a list of possible names like Bison, Vega, Shadaloo, and Lord. The Fighting Game Anniversaries Twitter account was quick to notice an interesting Easter egg with one of Bison’s examples, particularly the name “Vega,” which was what Bison was originally called in the Japanese release of
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2
  </em>
  .

  American
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  fans know Vega as the masked claw-wielding assassin of Shadaloo, but originally that name was given to his master. In turn, Vega was known as “Balrog” in Japan, and the boxer who bears that name in the US was called “M. Bison” in Japan as a reference to former undisputed world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. However, when
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2
  </em>
  was localized in the US, the names of the three Shadaloo members were switched around due to fears of a lawsuit from Mike Tyson over the perceived use of his likeness – a change that has stuck to this day.

  Without the explicit reference to Mike Tyson, the meaning behind the name “M. Bison” is a mystery for English-speaking
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  players, with not many being aware of the dark one’s original name or the switch-up with his henchmen.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  contains plenty of fun references to things like Blanka’s green skin, and now M. Bison is calling back to the confusion surrounding his name as part of his recent identity crisis.

  Although the original release did technically support co-op, it wasn't until the game's 2024 remake that
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  received proper two-player support. Some will perhaps argue that the narrative doesn't hit quite as hard when experienced this way, but most would probably be in agreement that the actual gameplay becomes a lot more enjoyable with two people.

  Players will need to work together in order to progress through this charming indie title and will experience plenty of heartfelt and exciting moments along the way. It may lack the same level of polish that some bigger budget titles are able to offer, but it more than makes up for this in charm and interesting ideas; both of which it delivers in spades.

  There were only a couple of console exclusives among the PS5's launch titles, one of which was
  <em>
   Sackboy: A Big Adventure
  </em>
  . Aiming to capitalize on the success of the
  <em>
   LittleBigPlanet
  </em>
  series, this charming 3D puzzle platformer proved to be very popular with younger gamers and those looking for something that they could play together with their kids.

  The new powerups that can be found throughout the game help to keep the experience feeling fresh, while the puzzles are challenging enough to get player's brains working a little without ever leaving them truly stumped. Finding all of the Dreamer Orbs is fairly manageable as well, so players should never find themselves getting frustrated as they explore.

  When it comes to first-person shooters, the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise still leads the way, even if standards have dropped off a little in recent years. Like pretty much all of its predecessors,
  <em>
   Modern Warfare III
  </em>
  supports split-screen co-op, allowing two buddies to hunker down on the couch and take on a team of bots or other players elsewhere in the world.

  Sadly, the game's campaign can only be experienced solo, which may come as a disappointment to some players. The same is true of certain game modes like Zombies, Free-for-All, and Ground War, but just about everything else that the game has to offer can be enjoyed locally with a friend. It's one of the best 2-player PS5 games when it comes to gunplay and a must-play for fans of the genre.

  shares very little in common with the 2022 mobile title, instead offering players a timely reminder of why so many people fell in love with the franchise in the first place.

  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is everything that a modern dungeon crawler should be, offering exciting action and near-infinite replayability in equal measures. Grinding for better gear and upgrades never really feels too tedious, particularly when the load is lightened by the presence of a friend, and each new season provides players with plenty of new content to consume.

  The nineties was a great time to be alive, especially for those who enjoyed gaming. Some of the very best video games of all time were released throughout the decade, including the first of what would prove to be many
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's
  </em>
  games. Several decades later, both it and its sequel were remade for modern consoles; much to the the delight of many.

 <p>
  The team behind the remakes did a fantastic job of recapturing the essence of the original games while also adding a few major quality-of-life updates. It certainly helps that the games' fantastic soundtracks remain largely unchanged, with only a handful of songs missing across the two titles. The multiplayer mode is fantastic too, with split-screen support available in several game modes.

  It may surprise some people to learn that
  <em>
   Human: Fall Flat
  </em>
  is one of the best-selling video games of all time. For those who've actually played the 2016 title, though, it's easy to see how this popular physics-based puzzle platformer could achieve such an impressive feat, such is the addictive nature of its chaotic yet fun-filled multiplayer gameplay.

 <p>
  Each level features a vast selection of unique puzzles, many of which can be solved in a number of different ways. No matter how much time players spend attempting to master Bob's movement and mechanics, things will never quite go according to plan, though rather than being frustrating, this unpredictability is arguably one of the game's biggest appeals.

  The humor may not be to everybody's taste, but the gameplay that's on offer in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  is really quite impressive. It builds expertly off of the strong foundations laid by previous series installments, with new vault hunters and weapons helping to keep things feeling fresh. The resulting game is one of the best looter shooters ever made and an excellent option for those on the lookout for a fantastic 2-player PS5 game.

  Much like all of the other
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games that came before it,
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  is at its best when played with friends; whether that be locally through split-screen co-op or online with PSN. There's a ridiculous amount of end-game content and DLC available too, so players should definitely come away from the experience feeling satisfied; assuming, that is, that they can drag themselves away at all.

  There are some fantastic fighting games on the PS5, but
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  is arguably the most well-rounded. Granted, its post-launch monetization may have angered some players, but the fighting experience that's on offer here is second to none and should appeal to those looking for a more grounded and beginner-friendly fighting game with fewer projectiles.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1004} -->

 <p>
  In terms of game modes, players are limited to classic 1v1 showdowns or the returning Tekken Ball mode. The latter can appear quite shallow to begin with but boasts a surprising amount of depth for those who take the time to truly master it. The fighting remains the main attraction, though, and helps to make this one of the best PS5 2-player games.

  Following a somewhat bumpy launch that was marred by the game's aggressive monetization,
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  has really come into its own. A series of regular updates has ensured that players keep coming back, while the addition of VR support helped to introduce both the game and the genre to a whole new audience. Sadly, VR can't be used in multiplayer, but the experience remains highly enjoyable nonetheless.

  After unlocking multiplayer in
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  , players will be treated to one of the best 2-player racing games of all time. The mechanics have been meticulously tweaked and dialed in for realism, with each of the game's 300+ cars behaving almost identically to its real-world counterpart. Online multiplayer probably won't suit casuals and beginners, but local 2-player split-screen can be fun regardless of one's skill level.

  <em>
   Chicory: A Colorful Tale
  </em>
  is a family-friendly adventure game with a story that unfolds across the pages of a coloring book. Using their magical paintbrush, players will need to add color to the world around them, which will in turn help them to solve puzzles, beat bosses, and uncover secrets. It can be experienced solo, but is much more enjoyable with two players.

  <em>
   Chicory
  </em>
  has since been ported to Switch and Xbox, which has helped to bring this magical adventure to a much wider audience. It remains one of the best 2-player PS5 games, though, and, thanks to its skippable boss fights, is the perfect title for those looking for something that can be enjoyed with kids.

  Although not exactly common when compared to their single-player counterparts, there's actually a fairly decent selection of co-op multiplayer RPGs on the market.
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is probably the pick of the bunch though, with the 2023 title offering a ridiculous amount of depth when compared to some of its peers; both past and contemporary.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  excels in multiple areas, but most would probably agree that it's the fantastic writing and the lack of filler that help it to stand out so vividly from the rest of the crowd. The characters feel incredibly genuine and their development is equally believable, which can make experiencing this epic adventure truly magical; more so when done with a friend or loved one.

  For a co-op-focused game to win Game of the Year is an incredibly impressive achievement, and one that
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  absolutely deserved. By building upon some of the ideas from his previous title
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  and introducing a whole host of new ones, director Josef Fares was able to deliver what many people consider to be the best co-op game of all time.

  The game tells the story of Cody and May, a married couple whose relationship is on the rocks. After being transported into two hand-made dolls by the tears of their distraught daughter, they must work together in order to fix their broken relationship. Unlike a lot of great 2-player PS5 games, it manages to nail both the story and the gameplay, making it a must-play for co-op game enthusiasts.

  Bringing back nostalgia and mayhem,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Reload offers players the chance to battle it out on a Mini-Battle Royale map against 40 players. Within this mode, players can find
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Reload-specific quests, as well as a
  <strong>
   bonus of 24,000 XP every 15 minutes whilst in the mode
  </strong>
  . This XP is
  <strong>
   granted up to 2.5 hours per day
  </strong>
  , meaning players can earn themselves a whopping 3 levels for just under 3 hours of playtime in a high-energy game mode such as this. Since this is also a rather rapid game mode, players can easily earn 1,000 XP per daily quest, and they will
  <strong>
   earn an additional 60,000 XP for completing 3 of these daily quests
  </strong>
  .

  Loading into
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , players can
  <strong>
   earn around 46,000 XP every 15 minutes
  </strong>
  . In just 30 minutes, players will level up their Battle Pass and total season level, just from this game mode. LEGO
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is fun in itself as a leading
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  competitor, but the problem lies in the fact that some players might not be interested in this game mode, and would prefer Battle Royale. Another factor to consider is that LEGO
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  AFK XP farms are unreliable, and Epic Games is quick to patch them out. Players have tried a multitude of ways to earn passive XP, but the best way is to simply
  <strong>
   play the game for 3 hours and enjoy 56,000 XP
  </strong>
  and the creative freedom of building and fighting PvE mobs.

  Loading into
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival, players can acquire a whopping amount of XP based purely on in-game activity. By playing
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival, players will
  <strong>
   earn 48,000 XP every 15 minutes
  </strong>
  . This equates to
  <strong>
   6 Levels a day in just 2 and a half hours thanks to the daily XP of 480,000
  </strong>
  . Players will need to head to the Main Stage at
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival, and whether it's solo or with other players, jam to a few iconic tracks from some amazing artists.

  Alternatively, there is a somewhat unreliable
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   Festival AFK XP tactic
  </strong>
  , which involves
  <strong>
   loading into the Main Stage
  </strong>
  <strong>
   as a solo player in no-fill
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   keeping the controller's analog sticks facing each other so that the player spins in a circle whilst their camera does the same
  </strong>
  . This should trick the game into thinking players are active, and it will see them earn XP every 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes. However, this tactic could see players removed for inactivity, so keep an eye on the game every 15 minutes and check XP levels to make sure it's working.

  One of the original ways to get XP in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  was through Save The World, the PvE experience that came even before the Battle Royale mode. Each level will take around 10 minutes, and although there are AFK methods, they are not as simple as newer methods, as players will need to set up a loadout and enter some familiar missions every time, rather than just standing there AFK.

  The best STW missions for XP can be found in the first map, Stonewood, and they are looking for Level 5 or under variations of
  <strong>
   Ride The Lightning and Retrieve The Data
  </strong>
  . Each run of these could
  <strong>
   give around 40,000 XP or more, with an XP cap of 450,000
  </strong>
  . Whilst it may take a few hours, it's still worth it for those in need of XP, although they will have to manually set up the mission and the defenses each and every time. Alternatively, players can set up their BASE for AFK farming, where they can trigger an Endurance mission and just wait out the time limit.

  XP can be somewhat passively earned in STW, but players are going to need the right loadout for the job. Whilst it may not be accessible straight away, here's the loadout that players should try and obtain if they want to get their hands on some easy XP, where they won't have to handle the controls as much as they wait for the mission to complete itself with gold medals and more XP:

  One of the best missions in Save The World for XP is Ride the Lightning. Players can find this in Stonewood, with the Level 3 version being in the
  <strong>
   Grasslands
  </strong>
  . Ride The Lightning will see players locate Lars and his van, which they will want to protect from Zombies as they await the timer to hit zero.

 <p>
  To start the activity, players will need 2 BluGlo for the first wave, and 2 more for the second. Players should create a structure and roof around the van to avoid Zombies hitting it or getting close because if Lars’ van gets hit, players will lose XP.

 <p>
  Ride the Lightning can drop around
  <strong>
   40,000 XP
  </strong>
  , and players will only be in this mission for around 10 minutes. This is a confident way to get XP for the Battle Pass, as each successful go at Ride the Lightning will see players receive half a level for the Battle Pass. It's a surprise this hasn't been banned in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .

  Retrieve the Data is a mission that certainly requires less effort than Ride the Lightning, and players can find this mission in the
  <strong>
   Suburbs
  </strong>
  , Stonewood at Level 5. All players need to do to activate this mission is to look to the sky and find the weather balloon. Once approached, players should build walls around it to stop enemies from hitting the balloon once it reaches the ground.

 <p>
  Players can shoot the balloon to let it pop, allowing for the data cache to drop, and then build a B.A.S.E. on the roof. From here, they can begin the mission, where they will simply need to defend the cache until the time runs out. A team in a public lobby is great here, but using the Thunder Thora loadout is the unstoppable force to make this a
  <strong>
   Fortnite AFK XP farm.
  </strong>

  Outside of the regular Battle Royale mode, players can find one of the best ways to farm XP in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  through the Creative Mode. Not only does Creative Mode hold plenty of imaginative and well-designed courses for players to enjoy, but it’s also a great source for players to get easy XP in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Players can earn up to, or over,
  <strong>
   546,000 XP per day
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s Creative Mode, simply by playing different modes created by the community.

 <p>
  Players can enjoy a bounty of different levels, from player-created story content to parkour courses, deathmatches, and many more. The content is endless in Creative Mode, and players could
  <strong>
   earn roughly 60,000 XP every 15 minutes
  </strong>
  <strong>
   (depending on what activities players are doing)
  </strong>
  whilst playing or hitting objectives, and accolades, such as eliminating other players, getting through levels, or even finding secret XP tokens in the level itself.

  The Pit is a free-for-all deathmatch, where players can test out almost every gun in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , as well as the wacky weapons from the past. Inside The Pit, players can make their loadouts, and drop into the arena below. Every kill will grant XP, and headshot eliminations provide even more XP, well over 8,000. Players can utilize the XP resources in The Pit to max out their Fortnite Creative XP cap for the day, and try and get better at aiming and shooting whilst they're here.

  The fastest way to get XP in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  can be by just playing the Battle Royale game mode. Players can either choose Zero Builds or Build Mode to find plenty of ways to get XP. Players can open chests, and crates, get eliminations, or even just survive storm circles to get XP, and that XP can be Super Charged if players have been inactive, or, if they hold a Victory Royale crown. However, there are some more-fledged efforts to obtain XP, such as Quests and Milestones, to help players reach the best skins in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's Battle Pass.

  When loading into the starting area of Battle Royale, players will see a pop-up that shows them 3 different Daily Quests that they can complete. These Daily Quests come at random and reset every game, and
  <strong>
   each completion grants 1,000 XP
  </strong>
  . However, the first 3 count as a Daily Bonus, which
  <strong>
   provides an additional 20,000 XP
  </strong>
  . Whilst it's not even a level in total, it can be useful XP, especially when the quests can be anything from emoting at a location to damaging enemies with a certain weapon type.

  <strong>
   Every Thursday at the Daily Reset (around 7 AM ET)
  </strong>
  , players will be granted a new set of weekly quests that further the story and provide new challenges for Battle Royale players.
  <strong>
   Each weekly quest grants around 15,000 XP
  </strong>
  , and there are
  <strong>
   usually 7 weekly quests in total, along with a 25,000 XP bonus for around every 4 quests
  </strong>
  . This means that
  <strong>
   each week, players can earn 105,000 XP
  </strong>
  just through completing the pre-made challenges, but be warned, other players might have the same idea, adding competition and difficulty to getting these events done.

  Tuesdays feature a new story quest related to Battle Royale and the changing island's narrative.
  <strong>
   Every quest completed from this story section grants 15,000 XP
  </strong>
  . Whilst it's a decent challenge and not the best source of XP, it's nice to hear about the narrative of the game through the character's voices, and players need to continue each part to unlock the next.

  Milestones come in a variety of stages, usually from 1 to 20. Milestones start out fairly easy, and there seems to be a near-endless supply of them, with
  <strong>
   each stage granting around 5,000 XP
  </strong>
  . These can range from easy objectives, like collecting Bars, completing matches, or even thanking the Bus Driver. It's an easy way to find a quest and grab some XP.

 <p>
  Survivor Medals are a recent addition that will see players earn mastery ranks to showcase their skills. Whilst they do not affect the lobbies players enter, they certainly do add a new goal, as players will be tasked with objectives like "
  <em>
   Reach 18 players with 2 eliminations
  </em>
  ", and
  <strong>
   earn 20,000 XP
  </strong>
  from it. These quests have many steps, and there are many different ranks to complete before they are all finished.

 <p>
  Preferably, players will want to earn XP without spending money or V-Bucks, but players who want to level up fast can find Level Up Quest Packs in the store. These range in price, but they are
  <strong>
   usually around 1,200 V-Bucks
  </strong>
  , and players can pick up a new outfit with some cosmetics, as well as a quest pack. One of the more recent additions, the Interstellar Aerial Quest pack,
  <strong>
   features 28 quests, with each completion granting a full XP level
  </strong>
  .

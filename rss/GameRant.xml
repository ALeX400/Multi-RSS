   500 Star Coins

  Similarly, Venison and Pork are also available for purchase at his stall for
  <strong>
   1,000 and 250 Star Coins,
  </strong>
  respectively. If you don’t have enough Star Coins, you can check out this detailed guide for more help. And just to quickly mention, all these meat items are exclusive to the A Rift in Time expansion pack.

  Wheat is a grain type ingredient that you can buy from Goofy’s Stall for three Star Coins or grow from Wheat Seeds. Players can get Wheat Seeds for one Star Coin at Goofy’s Stall in Peaceful Meadow and Ancient's Landing. After getting the seeds, dig a hole with your royal shovel, plant and water them, and in one minute, you can harvest two Wheat.

 <p>
  After you collect all the ingredients, go to a cooking station and add them to the pot. As usual, you’ll also need one Coal Ore to start cooking. You can get it by breaking rocks with your pickaxe in any area of the village. Once Classic Frankfurter is ready, you can sell it for
  <strong>
   2,628 Star Coins or consume it to restore 1,511 energy
  </strong>
  . Furthermore, fans can also serve it at Chez Remy to increase friendship levels with villagers.

      Ubisoft's
      <em>
       Far Cry

     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Far Cry: New Dawn
      </em>
      was seen as a letdown, undoing much of the progress made in
      <em>
       Far Cry 5
      </em>
      and failing to bring anything new to the franchise.
     </li>
     <li>
      <em>
       Far Cry 5
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Far Cry 3

      are considered standout titles in the series, with
      <em>
       Far Cry 5
      </em>
      praised for its refined gameplay, memorable antagonists, and organic open-world exploration, while
      <em>
       Far Cry 3
      </em>
      is often seen as the game that put the series and Ubisoft on the map with its innovative gameplay and captivating narrative.

  Ubisoft is a video game developer pretty much everyone is familiar with. This company has been in the news for both good and bad reasons, and players have very mixed opinions about the majority of games released by this publisher. However, regardless of what one's personal opinion may be, there's no denying that Ubisoft has left a mark in the video game industry that will be palpable for decades.

 <p>
  One of the company's many franchises that have seen massive success across the globe is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This series has gone through several transformations, even if many people are inclined to label this franchise as the poster child of what most Ubisoft sandbox titles are all about. Each game in the
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  series is alluring in its way, even if there are people who think otherwise.

   Cry is one of the most popular series in gaming, with Ubisoft's stellar work on the third mainline entry leading to a massive wave of popularity that brought new eyes towards this fun stealth-action series. Everything from sneaking around to blowing enemies apart feels great in these games, and players who want to check out the history of the Far Cry series will find a lot of great experiences to sink their teeth into. However, not all the games in this franchise are of equal quality, with some titles being notably harder to get through for players who are either used to modern gaming advancements or have less patience for tiresome gameplay loops.

  A rare example of a
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  game that has almost no redeeming factors,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Vengeance
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a Wii remake of
  <em>
   Far Cry Instincts: Evolution
  </em>
  that is worse in every way. This port was simply unnecessary and served only to soil the franchise's name.

 <p>
  The poor optimization issues, broken AI, and compressed FMVs are all part of the reason why fans aren't huge fans of
  <em>
   Far Cry Vengeance

  . It's a chapter in the

  VR gaming has become all the rage in modern times, and the fact that people can purchase a virtual reality headset to enjoy these games from the comfort of their own homes is mind-blowing in retrospect. However, some VR experiences feel better when an environment is curated to sustain such experiences, with Zero Latency being one such company that curates VR experiences that can only be enjoyed in their gaming centers.

  One such game that fans can get their hands on is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry VR: Dive Into Insanity

  </strong>
  , a fun 30-minute romp where players are captured by Vaas in the Rook Islands and must figure out a way to escape with their friends. It may not be the longest
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  experience around, but superfans who don't need an excuse to let them interact with Vaas' deplorable charisma will find
  <em>
   Dive Into Insanity
  </em>
  to be a decent half-hour VR experience to get immersed in with their friends.

  After the massive success of
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  , players were hyped to see how this franchise would evolve with later installments. However,
  <strong>
   <em>
    New Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  ended up being a slap in the face that undid most of the good of its previous title and brought many Ubisoft fans back to reality.

 <p>
  The idea of exploring the map of
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  in the advent of the nuclear bomb blast is interesting, but
  <em>
   New Dawn
  </em>
  doesn't do too much with this concept. It doesn't help that the writing is subpar and the game doesn't do anything new after the many innovations and refinements
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  brought to the table.

  The reveal of Giancarlo Esposito as the main villain of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  was more than enough to stoke the flames of hype for
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  , which is why it's a tremendous disappointment that this game crashed and burned from the very moment it was released. Once again, the copy-paste design of Ubisoft's games came back to bite them, with people denouncing
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  as a total and abject failure.

 <p>
  The unwillingness to improve and innovate on the systems of its predecessor hurt

  At a glance,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry Primal
   </em>
  </strong>
  seemed pretty interesting. The idea of a prehistoric
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  game could be pulled off well, with the lack of guns adding quite a bit of strategy to the gameplay.

 <p>
  However, the problem with
  <em>
   Far Cry: Primal
  </em>
  is that it brought nothing interesting to the table aside from a few changes to the core gameplay loop. The map design seemed ripped out straight from
  <em>
   Far Cry 4
  </em>
  , with the story and characters being way too forgettable for a series where the writing is one of its biggest selling points.

  The console version of
  <em>
   Far Cry

  was pretty fun in its own right, even if some aspects of the game had to be stripped down to make it more functional on consoles. The developers were so pleased by its performance that they greenlit a console-exclusive sequel for the title.

  The original remake and sequel of
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  were released on the Xbox. With the launch of the 360, Ubisoft jumped on the opportunity to release an updated version of both
  <em>
   Instincts
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Evolution
  </em>
  for new-gen console owners to enjoy, resulting in the collection known as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry Instincts: Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The graphical enhancements and performance improvements were certainly quite welcome, making this collection the definitive way to play both games. Playing this now can be a bit of a challenge, but players who are lucky enough for all their cards to align can check out the original
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  in all its HD glory.

   <em>

  Many people feel that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 5
   </em>
   i
  </strong>
  s the best game in the series, with Hope County becoming instantly iconic for a whole host of reasons. The title may have the systems many people expect from a run-of-the-mill open-world game, but it's the refinement and polish present in this title that made
  <em>
   Far Cry 5

  such a massive success.

 <p>
  It helps that the Seed family serves as some of the best antagonists in video game history, with each character showing a disturbing yet riveting personality that makes them easy to hate and captivating to listen to at the same time. The title's organic open-world exploration and fun gameplay helped
  <em>
   Far Cry 5

  become a fan-favorite title that popularized the series once again.

  <em>
   Far Cry

  on the PC was a treat, but console gamers felt ostracized that they couldn't check this stealth-adventure series. As a result, Ubisoft decided to develop a console version of the game that retained much of the original experience with a few cuts here and there.

  This, coupled with the pinpoint accuracy of enemies from miles away, makes

  After the magic of
  <em>

  , it's easy to see why so many people wanted to see its sequel elevate the franchise to even greater heights. However,

  just ended up feeling like more of the same with minor refinements and a new setting.

 <p>
  A recent interview has revealed that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Tifa and Aerith were originally a single character. The decision to split her into two separate
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  characters resulted in some of the most iconic heroines in a game to date.

 <p>
  Aerith and Tifa both have a big role to play in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , whether it's the original or the remake trilogy. While Aerith is deeply connected to the planet and the lifestream, Tifa is Cloud's childhood friend and knows him in a way that no one else does. Fans have debated for years which one is the best choice for Cloud, or simply the "best girl," but it turns out that might not have ever happened if the original plan had gone through.

 <p>
  In a new interview (via Siliconera) between Japanese publication Youngjump and Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer behind
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , the designing legend talked about Aerith and Tifa's character designs and origins. Nomura noted that he's never said this before, but Aerith was the original heroine designed for the game, but her original incarnation wasn't the same as the Aerith players eventually met when the game released. Instead, Aerith originally had something close to her current appearance, but with Tifa's personality. In an effort to break away from standard character formulas, the team decided to split Aerith into two distinct characters: Aerith and Tifa.

  System Restrictions Impacted Aerith and Tifa's Appearances
 </h2>
 <p>
  Aerith retained her appearance, but gained the curious, gentle, and spunky personality she has today. Meanwhile, Tifa was given a new character design, creating the tough but kind heroine gamers know today. Aerith was intended to be glamorous, but due to the restrictions polygonal modeling put on them at the time, Nomura chose to give her the now-iconic rope braid hairstyle, as depicting flowing, loose hair wasn't really possible. The hairtie added to the end of Tifa's long hair was also included for similar purposes. Intriguingly, Tifa's hair would cause problems in
  <em>
   Advent Children
  </em>
  , resulting in it being shortened.

 <p>
  All these years later, it may be hard for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  fans to imagine that Aerith and Tifa were once a singular entity. It also raises a lot of questions, like whether Aerith would have been a hand-to-hand brawler like Tifa ended up being, or whether she would have still been a childhood friend or a stranger Cloud had barely met. Considering how early in the development of the game this was, it's possible that combat and plot points hadn't fully come into the picture yet. However, it's certainly interesting to thnk that at one time, only Aerith - but not quite the Aerith fans know today - existed.

  Roguelikes continue to prove themselves to be an incredibly versatile genre. While some are sprawling, open-world epics, others, such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer Quest 2,
   </em>
  </strong>
  are more focused and dedicated dungeon-delving games, allowing players to build up a team of warriors and embark across a variety of regions.
  <em>
   Warhammer Quest 2
  </em>
  is essentially a direct upgrade to its predecessor, featuring more polish, more classes to construct a party with, and more versatility in builds and environments.

  Evocative of retro 90s-style shooters,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun
   </em>
  </strong>
  promises to immerse players in the gruesome darkness of the distant future armed with high-octane, high-efficiency weapons that can turn entire hordes of enemies into so much mincemeat. Boasting a deeply immersive environment and an array of weaponry, this is a title that will provide satisfyingly tactile combat for many hours. The Switch isn't known for hosting many 'boomer shooter' titles like this, so it's nice to see a game that brings around that style in such a satisfying way.

  Among the many sprawling armies of the Imperium, one in particular stands out as the most technologically advanced and immersed in the future that the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000
  </em>
  universe is predicated upon. The Adeptus Mechanicus is ready to put its technological firepower to the test in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus
   </strong>
  </em>
  in a host of well-designed missions that have plenty of opportunities for branching paths and different choices to be made. Not only does this add to the title's replayability, but it also makes the player feel as though they're having a tangible impact on the Imperium.

 <p>
  The sheer variety of units available for deployment is reason enough to give this strategy game a try, but the stylized graphics hold up incredibly well on the Switch as both a portable and docked gameplay experience. For fans of strategy games that might be new to the
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  universe,
  <em>
   Mechanicus
  </em>
  is a solid entry point, and is a title that will adeptly introduce players into the world and provide a key overview of what the Imperium is all about.

  Taking place in the incredibly dense world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Age of Sigmar,
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Storm Ground
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an unmissable title that boasts a huge array of playable factions from the
  <em>
   Age of Sigmar
  </em>
  universe. The fusion of roguelite and strategy elements makes for an incredibly addictive gameplay loop. Taking hold of the legendary Stardrakes for use in battle is an example of the kind of scale and scope that
  <em>
   Storm Ground
  </em>
  aims for, while giving players a tough enough challenge to make each victory feel earned.

  The campaign in

  is non-linear and shapes itself based around the players' chosen faction, allowing for tonnes of replayability and, beyond this, plenty of chances to personalize the units in battle and make the armies unique to the player. It's an addictive experience, and holds up incredibly well on the Switch, with the tight, tile-focused maps not losing any detail in portable mode, without becoming too sparse when on a larger screen.

 <p>
  Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have filed a lawsuit against
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer Pocketpair for "infringement of patent rights." Prior to its launch, many described
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  with guns. For those unfamiliar with the wildly successful title, the basic concept of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is that it combines survival game mechanics with features commonly seen in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise, like using balls to catch monsters of various elemental types for use in battle and exploration.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  first became popular, concerns were raised that the game featured Pals that looked too similar to existing Pokemon, and that some of its features may be too similar to what's been established by Nintendo's franchise. Some expressed the opinion that Nintendo could potentially sue
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  developer Pocketpair over the similarities between the IPs, and now that's finally happening, roughly eight months after Pocketpair's survival game was released in early access.

 <p>
  On September 18, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court against
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  developer Pocketpair. The lawsuit "seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld [...] infringes multiple patent rights." According to Nintendo, the lawsuit is being filed because the company says it will "continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights" to protect the Nintendo brand and its various franchises that "it has worked hard to establish over the years."

  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has not issued a response to Nintendo's lawsuit at the time of this writing. Previously, Pocketpair gave the impression that it hadn't heard anything from Nintendo about
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , though Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated in February, "We will take appropriate action against those that infringe our intellectual property rights." It's unclear exactly why Nintendo waited eight months since
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's early access to pull the trigger on a lawsuit, but this really couldn't have come at a worse time for the popular early access survival game.

  Currently,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is available on PC and Xbox in early access, though there have been rumors that the game is set to have a big showing at Tokyo Game Show. It's believed that the long-awaited
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  PlayStation port is going to be announced at the event, possibly coinciding with the game's 1.0 release. The Nintendo lawsuit could potentially throw a wrench in those plans. It's also unclear what this means for existing versions of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  on PC and Xbox.

 <p>
  It's no secret that
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  was a monstrous financial success, but even so, fighting against Nintendo and The Pokemon Company in court is going to be hugely expensive and challenging. It will be interesting to see what
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  developer Pocketpair has to say about the lawsuit, and hopefully, fans get some clarification on what this all means for the game's future.

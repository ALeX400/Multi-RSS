  A new rumor suggests that Sam Wilson will come to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  as a playable Captain America. Currently, the version of the Sentinel of Liberty that is available in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is Steve Rogers, one of the eight Vanguards that players can choose from.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steve Rogers may not be the strongest
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' Vanguard, but he is undoubtedly one of the most iconic faces in the cast. Armed with his Vibranium shield and extensive combat training, Captain America's job as a tank is to protect the team and make enemies spend their resources on him. To do this, Rogers uses his shield, which protects allies from incoming projectiles by reflecting them away and providing healing through his ultimate. When on the offensive, the Living Legend throws his shield to deal damage and pave the way to victory. However, for players who like another equally popular version of the hero, a rumor may be good news.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  leak suggests that Sam Wilson will be added to the game as a playable character, rather than a Captain America skin. The information that comes via Twitter user rivalsbrmarvel and was shared by UpdatesCAP4 says that, although the two heroes are known by the title of Captain America, they will be different playable characters. The leak doesn't directly mention any names other than Sam Wilson, although it does indicate that other characters in his situation will receive the same treatment.

  In the comics, Sam Wilson began his heroic career as the masked defender known as the Falcon. He later became Captain America's partner and took up the mantle during the events of the Secret Wars. But while the
  <em>

  community is excited about the possibility, this isn't the only “echo character” they'd like to see. In the comments, players mentioned names such as Anti-Venom, X23, Red Hulk, and Beta Ray Bill, one of the strongest versions of Thor.

 <p>
  Leaks and rumors always have the chance to change until official confirmation. However, Sam Wilson's potential debut in

      <title>Red Dead Redemption 3 Could Turn One RDR2 Faction On Its Head</title>

 <p>
  Over the course of two (admittedly quite big) video games, the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </strong>
  </em>
  series has crafted an incredibly vivid world. This world is filled with realistic characters and interweaving dynamics, bustling locations, and a handful of memorable factions, all of which take heavy inspiration from real-world history.

 <p>
  Tapping into real-world history gives
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  an extra layer of authenticity, and that authenticity makes its world feel all the more immersive. That's especially true when those very real historical elements are attached directly to the story's stakes, such as the case with
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  's Pinkerton Detective Agency, a faction that a hypothetical future
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3

  could turn on its head.

  The Pinkertons Have Been a Major Antagonistic Force in The Red Dead Redemption Series
 </h3>
 <p>
  A real-life organization founded in 1850 by Allan Pinkerton, the Pinkerton Detective Agency was a private security and investigation company that rose to prominence in the 1860s when it was hired by President Abraham Lincoln to conduct espionage missions against the Confederate forces during the American Civil War.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  and its sequel, the Pinkerton Detective Agency plays a prominent, antagonistic role, with two of its leading members – Agent Milton and Agent Ross – seeking to wipe outlaws out of the West, a quest that leads them into direct confrontation with the Van der Linde Gang. In
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , the Pinkertons chase Arthur Morgan and the rest of the gang across the West, having been hired by Leviticus Cornwall to apprehend Dutch following the gang's robbery of one of his trains.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Pinkertons don't manage to capture any of the Van der Linde gang alive in 1899, Agent Ross returns a decade later to finish the job. He captures John Marston's family and extorts the ex-outlaw into hunting down his former gang mates. Despite following Ross' orders, Marston never gets to see the freedom he was promised. With all of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  's protagonists being outlaws, the Pinkerton Detective Agency is painted quite clearly as the overarching villain of the series, overtly representing the new kind of law that threatens their way of life.
 </p>
 <h3 id="red-dead-redemption-3-could-put-an-interesting-new-spin-on-the-pinkertons">
  Red Dead Redemption 3 Could Put an Interesting New Spin on the Pinkertons
 </h3>
 <p>
  But
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  could flip fans' perception of the Pinkerton Agency on its head by putting players in the boots of a Pinkerton agent. The game could begin as a sort of Wild West version of
  <em>
   L.A. Noire
  </em>
  , where players investigate various crimes and hunt down the outlaws responsible.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would give
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  the unique opportunity to show what it looks like on the other side of the fence. Thrilling train robberies and daring bank heists might not look so impressive when faced directly with the innocent lives lost in their wake.

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_12">

    <p>
     Rockstar might be a bit hesitant to base an entire game around the Pinkerton Detective Agency following the real-world organization's failed attempt to sue the publisher back in January 2019 due to
     <em>
      RDR2
     </em>
     's negative portrayal of the agency.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 1

  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  both focusing on themes of urbanization and the sudden downfall of the Wild West from an outlaw's perspective, it might be interesting for the third entry to explore the completely opposite perspective, where the increased urbanization means increased peace, at least in the mind of the player-character at the start of the game.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  is being review bombed on Steam thanks to issues caused by a Windows 11 update.
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Origins
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  was released in 2017 to critical acclaim and became an important title for Ubisoft’s flagship franchise. Its design was widely regarded as influential to future
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around November of 2024, users started noticing issues with their games after a Windows 11 update caused stuttering and crashes in certain Ubisoft titles.
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  in particular received a temporary fix for crashing issues back in November. While Microsoft and Ubisoft have been working on a fix, issues with games like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Origins
  </em>
  still remain. Gamers on Windows 11 are advised to roll back their 24H2 update to an earlier version or avoid it entirely in order to get around most of these issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Around December 13,
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Origins
  </em>
  started receiving numerous negative reviews on Steam. This event coincides with the game being marked on sale during the holiday season, with it being 90% off for Steam users. Black screens, crashes, stuttering, freezes, and more issues can be blamed on the Windows 11 update 24H2 pushed out by Microsoft on October 1. This is especially troublesome for a landmark game like
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Origins
  </em>
  , which was influential to the design of
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Steam Deck users, however, haven’t reported any issues with the game on the Linux handheld. For fewer problems, players might consider using that device to play Ubisoft titles.

  <em>

  Ubisoft is reportedly in talks about a potential buyout from Tencent, with efforts focused on ensuring the Guillemot family retains control over Ubisoft's future. Ubisoft employees have expressed stress over the uncertain future of the company, and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned he is doing everything in his power to retain control of the company. However, the deal for the company’s future with Tencent is uncertain, and whether the Guillemot family will retain control is yet to be seen. Ubisoft’s sales figures have been declining lately, so time will tell if the potential Tencent deal and

  Although
  <strong>
   cozy games
  </strong>
  are usually defined by how they make someone feel, they must contain other elements too. Cozy games should be non-stressful, give the player warm and comforting vibes, and have a calming aesthetic. There should be no combat and hardly anything to make the heart race.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of the most popular cozy games involve raising animals and planting crops, but not all gamers want that sort of gameplay.

   Beyond the world of

   When the stress of everyday life becomes too much, nothing hits the spot like a cozy game with almost no tension. These escapes from reality are the definition of relaxing, allowing players to just forget their troubles for a few hours and just enjoy the warm scenery or pressure-free gameplay loop. Farming sims are synonymous with "cozy," but they do not have a monopoly on the term. Consequently, two more recommendations have been added that do not involve any farming.

   <em>
    Dungeons of Hinterberg
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a hack-and-slash RPG that tasks players with completing 25 dungeons, all of which are filled with enemies and puzzles. On paper, this might not sound particularly relaxing, but Microbird's project is surprisingly therapeutic. In-universe, the protagonist needs a break from her daily life as a lawyer, which has left her directionless and unfulfilled. Wanting to reignite her passion and imagination, she heads to Hinterberg, a place in the Alps that has become a hub for magic and dungeon crawling.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the story throws out a few twists and turns, the main gameplay loop revolves around casually exploring four regions, completing the occasional dungeon, and then heading back into town to enjoy a fun night out. Even the combat is quite laid-back, while still offering enough of a challenge to be engaging. This 2024 game is a delightful escape, and it is even available on Game Pass.

    Strange Horticulture

  </strong>
  is a darkly delightful game in which players discover and collect plants to sell in their new store. This is beyond any regular shop simulation game, however, as players soon realize this new town is full of mystery and intrigue.
 </p>
 <p>
  As folk appear in the store, it is up to the player to decide what each of them requires. They may want something simple like a sleep aid, or perhaps they are desperate for something to break a curse... The
  <em>
   Strange Horticulture
  </em>
  plant store has exactly what the people of Undermere need.

  has surprised players with its subtle story, which runs through this simple game's wordless puzzles. Players are taken on the journey of a faceless young woman leaving home for the first time. The game starts in a small, single bedroom, then moves to apartments and, finally, a family home.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players move to each new location, there are boxes to unpack and items to store away. The unpacking and tidying elements of the game are charming enough, but the poignant plot is what draws a player in. Who is this young person, and where will she end up next?

  is a completely revamped and polished version of the original 2005 game. This time around, players have new challenges and shiny new worlds to roll around in. The idea is to start small and collect items in the right order to make the ball as large as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a sweet and meaningful story accompanying the game, and adorable characters to meet, so it is far more than just a mindless ball-rolling game. Players can try it as a solo gamer or with friends in multiplayer. It's the perfect game to help players forget about a stressful day at work or school.

  MMOs can be kind of cozy. While most of them focus specifically on combat and can have high-stakes storylines, their gameplay loops can be quite relaxing in their own right, offering a way to spend hours grinding without having to put too much thought into things. That might sound like a criticism, but it is not meant to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sky: Children of the Light
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, however, quite different from the typical MMO, which is to be expected considering it is by the developer behind
  <em>
   Journey
  </em>
  . Focusing on exploration and social connections,
  <em>
   Sky
  </em>
  has no combat and encourages players to fly freely, interact with other people, and just embrace the moment-to-moment experience. The result might not be something that hits the mark with absolutely everyone, but it is unique. While not a farming sim,
  <em>
   Sky
  </em>
  players will need to farm some candles.

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  recently added new NPCs to the Transmogrification shops in Orgrimmar and Stormwind who sell previously-acquired Legendary items that have been lost or deleted. These NPCs were quietly added to the game in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.0.7, and can be found in both capital cities right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Legendary items in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  are some of the hardest items to obtain in the game. From iconic
  <em>
   Classic
  </em>
  weapons like Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian and Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker to
  <em>
   WoW: Dragonflight
  </em>
  ’s Legendary Nasz’uro, the Unbound Legacy, and Fyr’alath, the Dream Render, these pieces of gear often require weeks or even months of grinding to obtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, fans who accidentally misplace or delete their old Legendary weapons have a way to get them again. Though it was not mentioned in the patch notes for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.0.7, Blizzard added two new vendor NPCs to the game during the update.
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  content creator MrGM discovered that Seeker Ke’rath and Seeker Najed, located in the Transmog shops in Orgrimmar and Stormwind respectively, each sell copies of any Legendary items that players have unlocked in the past for 500 gold, giving them the chance to re-obtain them for any reason, be it for unlocking the appearance, sentimentality, or bragging rights.

  In order for a Legendary item to appear in the vendor’s inventory, one must have completed the relevant achievements or quests, and not have it anywhere in their inventory or bank. Additionally, some Legendary items, including the rings from
  <em>
   Warlords of Draenor
  </em>
  and various gear from
  <em>
   Legion
  </em>
  , are purchased from other vendors found in their expansion zones. Legendary and Artifact items that can be upgraded, such as Ashjra’kamas, Shroud of Resolve, and the Heart of Azeroth, will be reverted to rank 1 when purchased. Lastly,
  <em>

  Artifact weapons cannot be found at this vendor, as they currently cannot be deleted by any means.

  Before checking these vendors, players who are missing these items should try to use the Item Restoration
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  feature first, as it does not have a gold cost associated with it. If the item has already been purged from the database, fans now have a backup method of obtaining these rare items once again.

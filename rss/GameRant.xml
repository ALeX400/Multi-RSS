 <p>
	When it comes to the mobile gaming market, the
	<em>
	 Sonic the Hedgehog
	</em>
	franchise has had many titles come and go over the years. Now that Sega has acquired Rovio, however, more mobile
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	games are on the horizon, with
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Sonic Rumble
	 </strong>
	</em>
	being one of the first to come out of this partnership. Aiming for a Winter 2024 release,
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	recently held a weekend-long closed beta test, which Game Rant was invited to attend.

	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	wears its inspirations on its sleeve as a platforming battle royale title. Comparisons to
	<em>
	 Fall Guys
	</em>
	are inevitable with the majority of
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	's stages using all the iconic elements of the genre, including obstacles like breakable walls, bumpers, balancing platforms, and swinging pendulums. That said, the
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	franchise being made into a platform-based battle royale game fits like a glove. There is more than enough that gives
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	its own identity, and it's shaping up to be a fun experience for all ages.

	The game begins as Dr. Eggman declares his latest project, Egg Toy Land, complete. He sends Sonic a few of his toys in a bid to get the hedgehog to play with (and lose against) him, and Sonic declares he isn't one to back down from a challenge. From there, players are pulled into a tutorial that holds their hand but also provides a quick understanding of the many buttons on their mobile screens. Without a controller,
	<em>
	 Rumble
	</em>
	players will have a thumbstick on the left side and three buttons on the right. In order to keep the controls simple, specific buttons won't light up or be usable until fans are near an objective that necessitates them. Most players will be spending their time running and jumping, hitting dash panels to go faster, and avoiding obstacles to stay ahead of the pack.

	Just like in
	<em>
	 Fall Guys
	</em>
	, stumbling or getting sent backward can make or break a player's results by the end, but familiar stage elements from
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	games like loop-de-loops and springs are used alongside different level designs that feel more Sonic Team and less Mediatonic. Each
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	stage featured in the game thus far keeps its unique elements, like Starlight Carnival's hologram purple road, to emphasize the blue blur's world. The end result is a game that captures both the
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	series' charm, while still remaining a bundle of charmingly cute mayhem.

 <p>
	That said, there's certainly a difficulty between stages that doesn't entirely get communicated, leaving some players to go through Green Hill Run with very basic obstacles to later play Starlight Carnival Run, which is filled with pits and explosions. The jump mechanic in
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	seems to rely on being on the ground as well, making the mechanic useless if a fan falls off the stage for any reason. If this keeps happening, it can make or break what would otherwise be a rather fun match. With a few issues lingering from the fact that
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	is still in beta, many frustrating moments would occur as a result of minor glitches, or most noticeably, latency issues.

 <p>
	While playing, opponents would zip across the screen at faster speeds than the player, as if the game needed to catch up between screens at times. Other effects such as the corners of the screen flashing red when taking damage would occur despite not being hit by any obstacles, and some players would be favored by the lag more than others. This showed the most with one stage taken from
	<em>
	 Sonic Lost World
	</em>
	, Frozen Factory Teams. Fans could easily be left running around, not affecting the match whatsoever due to how low in the pecking order they were due to lag.

	If players go into
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	expecting that they need to be the best out of everyone, that's where they'd be wrong.
	<em>
	 Rumble,
	</em>
	from the very beginning, uses how many rings fans collect to decide who's in first, second, third, and so on. Currently, the matches play out in specific ways - a race that cuts the starting roster of players by half with the first 16 qualifying for round 2, a team battle that only leaves the last eight standing, and then a "Ring Battle" free-for-all with attacks, obstacles, and challenges unique to the game's selection of iconic
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	stages.

 <p>
	Just being the fastest
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	fan in these challenges may be enough to net bonus rings at the end of a stage, but being first doesn't mean that player has the most rings, and therefore, doesn't mean that they're necessarily holding the winning spot. Even a player who's managed to hold onto eighth place until the final round can play their cards right, steal rings from everyone else, and manage to come out on top. The final rounds of
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble
	</em>
	are truly anyone's game, which makes it just as chaotic and unpredictable as most players expect from party games.

	Rings are even more important than the emblems players earn from taking first place. Rings can be redeemed for all sorts of custom gear in the shop, where the concept of emblems, taken straight from the

	The progression and way players could earn items in the beta were immensely satisfying. All the rings players collected were saved as currency after their matches were over, and special campaigns - the Year of Shadow pass, Amy's Request, and Dr. Eggman's Challenge in particular - made earning Red Star Rings, medals, and special cosmetics fun and rewarding. Anything that required currency that wasn't rings was optional, but the beta still offered more than enough to unlock everything. It begs the question of how this progression will change in order to encourage players to spend money on the same items.

	From what was seen in the beta,
	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble

	has a good gameplay loop going for it; one that doesn't punish players for not winning and makes it easy for players to get anything they want with the rings they collect while going through the motions. There are quite a lot of customization options available, allowing fans to play as and dress up their favorite
	<em>

	characters through skins, collect buddies to follow them, and express themselves through emotes, stickers, and even have special poses before the match and for victories.

	<em>
	 Sonic Rumble

	is a cute, hilariously chaotic, yet fun easygoing game that will have people playing it again and again.

 <p>
	A famous 2D animator named John Pomeroy has recreated one of
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Genshin Impact
	 </em>
	</strong>
	's most popular characters, the Hydro Archon Furina.
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	's cel-shaded graphics give the game a very anime-like visual which often inspires fans to recreate their own artwork in different styles.

 <p>
	Lady Furina has been in the main spotlight throughout the Fontaine arc and many consider her story to be the best part of the Hydro nation's lore. She was added back in
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	Version 4.2 along with the popular Fontaine journalist, the four-star Cryo catalyst user, Charlotte.

 <p>
	A Reddit user named Rinzel- has shared an interesting video on
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	's main subreddit, featuring the famous 2D artist John Pomeroy recreating Furina in a classic art style. John Foster Pomeroy is an American animator, known for working for many major studios, such as Walt Disney Animation Studios and Sullivan Bluth Studios. His most popular animation films include
	<em>
	 Atlantis:
	</em>
	<em>
	 The Lost Empire
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 The Secret of NIMH
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 An American Tail
	</em>
	, and many others. Currently, he also works as a tutor on Bilibili, where this video footage was taken from. Many fans in the comment section seemed to like the artist's take on Furina as the post reached over 4.4k upvotes.

 <p>
	Many fans praise the contrast between Furina's blue and white color palette with the red throne-like chair in the background. Some comments claim they would love to see the game's most popular female characters redrawn as Disney princesses. According to G
	<em>
	 enshin Impact
	</em>
	's recent announcements, Furina could soon make a return to the limited banner.

	The recent livestream event for

	Version 4.7 confirmed that she will finally get her first re-run. Furina will be placed on the second banner phase alongside another Hydro character, the new five-star bow user Sigewinne. While some fans praise HoYoverse for giving Furina her first re-run, others claim that she should've been featured in a different update, considering that 4.7 will feature two new five-star characters and a new four-star unit.

 <p>
	This means that most Travelers, especially free-to-play players, probably won't be able to acquire all three limited five-star characters in Version 4.7. When it comes to her power on the field, Furina remains one of, if not the most powerful Hydro character in the
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact

	, thanks to a complex kit that can fit almost any team composition in the game. Her Pneuma and Ousia forms allow her to constantly swap between offensive and defensive playstyles.

	For a long time,
	<strong>
	 <em>
		The Sims
	 </em>
	</strong>
	has been the definitive life simulation game, and its sales numbers back this up.
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	alone has sold over 10 million copies. However, there are other life simulators on the way that could steal the crown from Maxis's long-running franchise.

 <p>
	One of these contenders is an upcoming life simulation game by Midsummer Studios. Though there are few details revealed about it, it will be yet another story-driven life simulation title. It will have to be a competitive title if it wants to stand out from the likes of

	 The Sims

	Jake Solomon is familiar with superhero games from his years at Firaxis, and his name is synonymous with turn-based tactic games. After leaving the studio in 2023, he set out to start a new independent studio, Midsummer Studios. It is through the studio that Solomon and his team will be launching a life simulation game.

 <p>
	Not much is known about the life simulation game the studio is working on. In fact, a name hasn't been announced yet. However, the official site states that it's a next-gen game that lets players write their own story and share it with the world.

	Although this may seem outside of Solomon's comfort zone, he does have some experience with life simulation games. In an interview with Eurogamer, he revealed that he and some team members do play "The Sims here because there are so many things that it does really well." There are many members of the team from Firaxis who aren't familiar with the franchise, and they've been encouraged to play it as well.

	According to Solomon, through gameplay, players will write "a story that's 1), interesting to you first, but then 2) potentially could be interesting to other people." This isn't an entirely novel idea, as it's what

	has been built on. In the franchise, players are given freedom to craft their own story whether it be a career-driven one or a family-oriented one.
	<em>

	will continue with this gameplay with Project Rene, which is still in early development and will feature multiplayer elements, allowing different stories to intertwine.

			<title>Pokemon GO: Primal Reversion Explained</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Pokemon GO
	 </strong>
	</em>
	has a wide collection of different Pokemon that can be unlocked. Some of these adorable creatures even have special abilities or versions of themselves, which make them stand out from all the others and make them more powerful. One of these things is called Primal Reversion, which is something that Pokemon like Kyogre and Groundon have.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":351} -->

 <p>
	Primal Reversion is a type of transformation similar to Mega Evolution, where certain Pokémon will temporarily take on a new appearance, affect weather bonuses, improve their performance in battle, and receive other unique benefits. It is obvious that doing this will help the outcome of any battles that take place during the time this Pokemon is using its Primal Reversion form in
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	There are many different Pokemon that can undergo the Primal Reversion transformation but it requires players to obtain objects to use in order achieve the Primal Reversion form of the Pokemon. It is very similar to how Mega Evolution works in the sense players will need to participate in raids to be able to get the items needed to change the form of the Pokemon. For example, Kyogre will need Kyogre Primal Energy which is what boosts its new form for the limited time.

	When it comes to using this on Kyogre it will require 400 Energy. Players can view how much energy they need by clicking on a Pokemon's card that has the ability to Primal Reversion. Below is a list of all the Pokemon who can currently do this in
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	Something else to note is that the more times that Pokemon goes under the Primal Reversion transformation, it will cost players less and less energy each time. The way to get energy for the Pokemon is by doing raids where the Primal Reversion is defending, players will get an amount with each win. Each time the Pokemon does change it form it will only last a total of eight hours, which relates it even more to how Mega Evolution works as it is also timed to only be in effect for a short time.

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	The Final Shape may threaten all of reality, but why not go out with style? The Hazardous Propulsion Exotic is a new chest armor for Titans, and this class-specific Exotic is going to provide those with a love of rockets with a good time in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Destiny 2
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. For those with The Final Shape expansion, it’s time to get to work and stop the Witness, bring about a conclusion to the Light and Dark saga after a decade, and a new Exotic chest armor might help.

From here, they will need to build up their reputation rank through decoding Prime Engrams and Exotic Engrams, and they will need to prestige Master Rahool's vendor rank. The total reputation
	<strong>
	 XP required to prestige at Master Rahool is 6,000
	</strong>
	. Below, players can find the reputation gains across all ranks:

	Once players have reached the prestige rank with Master Rahool, they will unlock Tier 3 Focusing, which means they can spend an Ascendant Shard and an Exotic Cipher on the specific piece of Exotic armor that they want, which in this case, will be Hazardous Propulsion. Only through acquiring a prestige rank at Master Rahool’s vendor, will players be able to acquire this exotic prize. This should take around 40 exotic engrams, or 12 if players focus on specific exotics.

		Weapon precision hits or final blows have a chance to load a Kinetic Exodus rocket. Activating your class ability fires loaded Exodus rockets. Damaging targets with Exodus rockets temporarily increases the damage you deal with all other rockets.

	When acquiring Hazardous Propulsion, players will receive a random roll of Mobility, Resilience, Recovery, Discipline, Intellect, and Strength, but these numbers can be further encouraged by focusing a specific stat on a Ghost Shell. Nevertheless, there’s one thing in particular that fans will want Hazardous Propulsion for, and that’s its exotic armor perk.

 <p>
	In essence, Hazardous Propulsion will allow players to further synergize their builds with rockets. Through a multitude of precision hits and final blows, players will build a stack of rockets, and in using their Class Ability, which for Titans is a barricade, they will be able to unleash a tracking volley that is fired into enemies. On top of this, players will see a temporary increase in damage with other rockets, so Rocket Launcher Power Weapons can easily become the next best thing for Titan builds.

 <p>
	The damage buff for rockets with Hazardous Propulsion is around 35%, and it even buffs Wolfpack Rounds, providing a true contender for the new meta when it comes to spamming rockets and causing immense damage to PvE enemies in Raids, Nightfalls, and Dungeons.

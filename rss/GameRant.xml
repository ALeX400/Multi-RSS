  fans already know the fun of creating the best outfit and taking first place on the podium. Not only does it help you earn stars and raise your rank, but it also
  <strong>
   rewards you with in-game currency

  . With that cash, you can buy new clothes and accessories to level up your style. So, it’s definitely worth pairing up your makeup with an outfit that is jaw-dropping, giving you the recognition you deserve.

  To win the fashion showdown in
  <em>
   Dress To Impress
  </em>
  , you’ll need to follow the theme. Themes are announced at the start of each round and must be completed within five minutes, so use the first few seconds to understand the theme before designing your outfit. If you’re unsure about a theme, click the
  <strong>
   ‘Dress’ icon
  </strong>
  at the top center of the screen for details.

 <p>
  Next, bring your creativity to life by selecting the perfect clothing, shoes, handbags, hairstyles, and more. For example, if the theme is ‘Coquette,’ choose girly and feminine items like the Strawberry Dress, Bunny Slippers, Bear Headband, and a Pink Bow accessory. Fans who pick spooky makeup looks and glow-up items for this theme will likely not win the round.

   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed that it will cross over with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Since its announcement,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has made headlines by bringing together heroes and villains from the House of Ideas in a shooter. After carrying out a series of tests to give a preview of what's in the store, launch day is approaching, and players are getting increasingly excited about finally checking out the full game.

  Developed by NetEase,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  creates its
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  spin by putting players into 6v6 teams in action-packed matches with well-known characters such as Iron Man, Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Venom. The game uses a role system, dividing the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  cast into Duelists, Strategists, and Vanguards, who are, respectively, the DPS, supports, and tanks of the game. To further increase the hype for the game's release on December 6, the developers have shared some unexpected but big news.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  will have a crossover with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , as announced on the official Marvel Games Twitter. Named “Chronoverse Collaboration,” the message reveals that Epic Games' battle royale will join forces with the NetEase shooter, but gives no details of what this crossover will entail or when it's coming out. Additionally, the message reveals that the collaboration will extend to the card game
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel Puzzle Quest
  </em>
  , and the RPG
  <em>
   Marvel Future Fight
  </em>
  . But as in the case of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , the message gives no hint of what's to come, instead teasing that the collaboration will be released and promising to reveal more details about it at some point.

  Players showed excitement and surprise at the announcement, which put

  . Some gamers also expressed excitement at the potential appearance of Galacta in the Epic Games title and the release of a Moon Knight skin.

       Right after arriving at Florall Island, players can go up the ramp on the right of the Save box to find the first two Sprite Bulb nests. Each nest has three Sprite Bulbs. However, one of the Sprite Bulbs on the first nest can't be obtained for now, as it is too high up.

  The
  <em>
   Crusader Kings
  </em>
  series was hard to get into once, but the latest title has ensured that beginners can jump into this title without too many worries. The fact that
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  managed to be welcoming without sacrificing its complexity shows just how far Paradox Interactive has come with its grand strategy titles.

  Players rule over domains that vary in size, and players can always choose to play as a king or queen from the get-go. However, there's something satisfying about playing as a duke or duchess and slowly ascending to the top before players earn a title that lets them rule a kingdom.

  A charming grand strategy game that players can get into without succumbing to a steep learning curve,
  <em>
   Civilization 6

  is an incredible evolution of the series. Controlling a reputed world leader and helping a civilization reach new heights makes for a solid gameplay loop fans can't get enough of.

  Conquering nations, advancing to the space age, and being diplomatic are just a few of the many ways this game allows players to lead their kingdoms to glory. Each playthrough feels unique based on the leaders that players control and makes
  <em>

  a treat every single time players embark on another glory-laden playthrough.

  The breakout success of Tinder inspired many romances and a video game that became a breakout hit on mobile.
  <em>
   Reigns
  </em>
  lets players control a kingdom by swiping left or right on certain decisions, ensuring that they maintain a balance of resources and power.

 <p>
  This may seem simple, but the sheer number of ways players are forced to make tough decisions after their balance is ruptured makes every playthrough of
  <em>
   Reigns
  </em>
  a nail-biting affair. It helps that the game is loaded with unique events, ensuring that players won't see too many cards repeating across their numerous playthroughs.

  <em>
   The Sims Medieval

  was a fun spinoff that added a quest-based structure to the tried-and-tested gameplay of
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  . The results may be a bit of a mixed bag, but fans who love the simulation elements of
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  didn't mind a game that compelled them to accomplish certain things while also helping their chosen Sim survive.

 <p>
  What made
  <em>

  such a blast to play through was the fact that players have to also manage a kingdom while controlling their Sim. This makes for a fun progression loop as players do everything they can to help their kingdom prosper after starting with little to nothing.

  <em>
   Wrath of the White Witch
  </em>
  is one of the best video games JRPG fans can get their hands on. While its sequel may lack the charm and writing that made its predecessor such a huge hit,
  <em>
   Revenant Kingdom
  </em>
  makes up for it with excellent combat and a fun kingdom management mechanic.

  Helping Evermore become a prosperous kingdom after starting from nothing makes for a great and satisfying time. While the management side of things can feel a bit shallow, it's a great accompaniment to the main gameplay of
  <em>
   Ni no Kuni 2
  </em>
  that makes it worth checking out for fans.

   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have noticed that even though the developers said they removed a no-attachments challenge, it's still around. The ability to partake in frequent challenges seems like a feature that can break up any possible monotony that players may experience while revisiting
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  on a daily basis. With the presence of challenge events in the game, the developers can incentivize players to try out new things, stop focusing on a quickly forming meta, and enjoy each unique element that
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  and its weapons can offer gamers.

 <p>
  There has been a constant wave of news surrounding
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ahead of Season 1, and the game's promise of consistent updates with fresh content is exciting to many players. With so much going on, there's room for some error. Some players believe weapons deserve nerfs, and others aren't enjoying the challenges the game is incentivizing people to try, so the developers may remove especially frustrating ones. Despite the willingness to listen to the player base, some fans are noticing that stated changes aren't showing up as guaranteed.

 <p>
  Reddit user Skywave_KR shared that in the most recent
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  patch notes, the daily challenge to get 50 eliminations using weapons with no attachments was claimed to be removed. However, while playing the latest version of the game, the challenge was still up. Other players have shared that they noticed the same inconsistency between the patch notes on the website and their games, and some have suggested this is a consistent occurrence with Treyarch titles.

  In the comments, other players have shared that they don't understand the developer's intention to remove this daily challenge in the first place, stating that it's easy to knock out in two or three of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's fast-paced multiplayer games. Some players have pointed out that they dislike the daily challenge that comes right after, which instructs players to get five kills while they've blinded enemies with a Flashbang. Many of these challenges seem to encourage players to experiment with their game while building on their fundamentals, but since they are challenges, they can be hard to achieve.

 <p>
  So far, the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  webpage has not been changed to address the false removal of the no-attachment daily challenge. Treyarch appears to be paying a lot of attention to the way that XP is earned in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , and the presence or removal of certain daily challenges could impact the flow of gameplay for plenty of people who value this feature.

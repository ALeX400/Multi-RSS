   <strong>
    Remnant 2
   </strong>

  ticks all the boxes on the wishlists of players of its prequel,
  <em>
   Remnant: From The Ashes,
  </em>
  by combining elements of gameplay that challenge both your skills and patience in combat, as well as your ability to solve riddles and puzzles. One such puzzle can be found in Yaesha, where players will need to become familiar with how to play a water harp.

  In the forest-like world of Yaesha, players have their musical skills tested as they are tasked with playing the water harp to progress through
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  's main story. While they are, on the surface, tough riddles to crack, players will discover that the answers may very well be right under their noses. Here is
  <strong>
   how to solve the Water Harp puzzle in
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  and earn the Carnage in C-Minor achievement.

  In order to complete the Water Harp puzzle, players will first need to continue exploring Yaesha to
  <strong>
   find their way to the lever that releases the waterfall
  </strong>
  to operate the harp. To do this, players will need to pass where they encounter Meidra, and continue along the path to her left. After overcoming some enemies, a doorway will appear to walk through.

 <p>
  Players need only follow the path to find the lever that releases the water before continuing along the path to the right of the entrance, which will open a previously locked door. As the checkpoint appears, players should consult the table next to it and open the book lying there.
  <strong>
   On the first page of the book is the correct combination to play the Water Harp's song.
  </strong>
  The horizontal lines indicate that no note is being played.

  Players looking to complete all the achievements in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  will need to play an additional secret song to earn the Carnage in C-Minor trophy. Unlike the main puzzle, this song does not have a written clue to guide players, but an auditory one.

 <p>
  To tick off this objective, players will need to
  <strong>
   replicate the song played by the Flutist after the Ravager quest has been completed
  </strong>
  . Despite there only being five note options (six, if skipping a note is included), this can be quite tedious to replicate. For those hoping to reap the rewards of a keen ear, here is the combination of the secret song:

   <em>
    Updated August 2, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. More changes are on the horizon for Destiny 2 players as Bungie announced upcoming tweaks in future updates. In an effort to revitalize its weekend PvP mode,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is making Adept Weapons easier to obtain in Trials of Osiris. Specifically, the Passage of Persistence will no longer remove wins when playing as a trio and will keep wins as long as a match is completed.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition, the exotic class armor is getting easier to farm in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . After plenty of fan feedback, Bungie is planning to add a weekly challenge to the Dual Destiny mission, giving players an exotic class armor drop for finishing the mission for the first time each week per class. On top of that, the chest drop rates are being improved, with even more boosted rates for participating inside the daily Overthrow location. The changes are being made to make it slightly easier to farm the equipment in the hopes of getting the specific drop players are looking for.

 <p>
  In the meantime, the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  weekly reset continues right along with its usual refreshed content, activities, and rewards for players to chase over the next week. For a complete look at all the new content available for the week of July 30, including Nightfalls, Crucible modes, and challenges, here is everything players need to know.

   <em>
    MyPopGoes
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  spin-off by developer Kane Hodder, produced by the Fazbear Fanzverse Initiative. One of a variety of
  <em>
   PopGoes
  </em>
  titles,
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  sees players attempt to keep a 90s-era digital pet alive and entertained at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. A free, early version of the game was released on GameJolt in 2023, allowing fans to experience its campaign. However, this week’s
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  10th Anniversary Celebration has kicked off with the full, paid version of
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  launching on Steam. While the free version is still available for fans wishing to experience the base offering, fans and newcomers alike shouldn’t dismiss this newest version.
  <em>
   MyPopGoe
  </em>
  's full Steam release makes the
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  spin-off feel like a whole new game.

  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  is a canon entry in the
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  Fanverse’s PopGoes timeline and follows Bonnie Glade, who receives a digital pet of PopGoes the Weasel for her 10th birthday. To “survive” the title’s five nights, Bonnie must keep PopGoes alive by helping him cook and eat pizza, giving him soda to drink, and keeping him entertained. Initially released as a joke in April 2023, developer Kane Hodder has now turned
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  into a full-fledged spin-off, complete with dark and shocking lore reveals. What’s more, this week’s Steam release hides a few big surprises for those familiar with the larger
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  narrative and
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  timeline.

  While the original
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  started as a joke release, its early version delivered a compellingly simple resource management sim. In classic
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  fashion, its campaign was spread across five rounds, with each turning up the difficulty and revealing new insights into its larger narrative. Fans who completed the challenge were rewarded with a single ending, before being invited to test their skill in a new mode, Endless Day. With the release of the full
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  this week, fans can experience these elements and so much more.

 <p>
  In addition to an updated version of the early version’s campaign,
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  ’ full Steam release includes a plethora of new content. In addition to its Endless Day mode, the full release includes five Challenge Days and five Special Modes, including Fishing, Longest Day, and Topping Juggle. Completionists will have their hands full with the newest version of
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  , as Hodder has added a wide range of unlockables to the title, including 21 achievements, six unlockable characters, a variety of Diary Entries and Stickers, and Character Bios. On the tech side,
  <em>
   MyPopGoes
  </em>
  Steam release also adds Spanish Language Translation and Controller Support. However,

  features a blink-and-you-’ll-miss-it reveal, before the credits roll. However, fans who beat the base game in the Steam version will be greeted by a message following this scene, revealing it to be the first of three endings featured in the title. What’s more,

  However, the fact that they needed a new character upset some fans of the franchise, which inspired some modders to figure out how to get their existing character from the original game over to the mod. Here's a guide to how some players have been able to get their character over from the game (which was originally mentioned on Reddit by user Pqblo.

  After downloading the mod, players will be able to move their existing save file into the mod, but it isn't as straightforward as players would want it to be. To begin with, players will need to get on the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  save. Then, they will want to teleport to "
  <strong>
   Mysterious Scientists 1
  </strong>
  ," which can be done by typing the following into the console command bar: "
  <strong>
   player.moveto 0719c0c7
  </strong>
  ". After that, they will find themselves within a wall, but by using the console command to clip through walls (done by typing "
  <strong>
   tcl
  </strong>
  " in the console commands), players will be able to leave the wall and will find themselves in London. Type in the console command to clip through walls again to turn that off, and players are now able to play the game like normal.

  As of right now, those who have tried this glitch to get their character into the mod's world haven't reported any issues. In fact, most have mentioned that it didn't cause issues with the mod or the base game, allowing them to truly enjoy their time in London. Additionally, they were able to bring over their favorite companions, which made all the work worthwhile for most players who tried this.

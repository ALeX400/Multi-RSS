  <strong>
   Open-world
  </strong>
  titles have progressed by leaps and bounds since they took over mainstream gaming. A well-designed sandbox isn't enough to attract players. Along with a detailed world, these games need to feature a myriad of gameplay loops that will keep fans interested until the end of these engaging experiences. Numerous elements are integrated into these games to make the open worlds feel as engaging as possible, and focusing on a dynamic mode of traversal is a great area to build upon.

  This leads to some open-world games with driving mechanics that are so polished and engaging that most players won't mind spending hours upon hours messing around with the many unique and familiar vehicles they can get their hands on. Open-world games that consider driving to be a major gameplay pillar will love any game that executes this aspect with great skill, letting players zoom through the streets in style. Since any open-world racing game can qualify here, they will be ignored in favor of titles that feature other mechanics as well.

  It's a shame that many people did not check out
  <em>
   Mad Max

  when this underrated title came out. Players will forget about any narrative issues once they get their hands on a vehicle and see how much work was put into this aspect of the game. Cars are heavily customizable and can be kitted out with numerous weapons to take out the opposition in style.

  The sheer joy players can experience while driving around vast expanses of the wasteland while completing the title's many missions forms one of the game's many highlights. The

  Many fans complained about the integration of the Batmobile in
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  and how it dominated a chunk of the gameplay. While it's true that Batman's vehicle plays a major role in some missions, it's balanced with many on-foot free-roam sections coupled with the iconic
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  combat fans have grown to love.

 <p>
  With the reception to this game warming up over time, more people have come to appreciate the Batmobile as one of the best vehicles players can use to zip around the streets of Gotham. The car is loaded with several weapons and can become a makeshift tank when required. With its boosters and drifts making the driving sections more engaging, it's easy to see why the driving mechanics in
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  are a huge achievement that helps this game stand out as one of the best
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  games.

  It's only a given that any
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  game would be hailed for its driving mechanics, with this aspect of the title wowing fans from the very moment players got to drive around in a vehicle in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  . This gameplay pillar has been improved and polished time and time again in the other
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games, with
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  featuring the best driving mechanics the series has ever seen.

  The fact that the attention to cars and other vehicles in
  <em>

  </em>
  rivals that of bonafide racing games shows the amazing talents at work in Rockstar Games. These systems are a joy to interact with and go a long way in ensuring that controlling characters like Franklin and using his powers to handle cars efficiently never ceases to be engaging. Fans who want to race against other players can do the same in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  , with the driving mechanics of this title getting even more time in the spotlight.

  In all honestly, the driving mechanics in
  <em>
   Sleeping Dogs
  </em>
  themselves aren't what sells this portion of the game. Fans of Hong Kong action cinema love the focus on practical stunts and how something as formulaic as a car chase can turn into moments of pure drama as the heroes put it all on the line to jump onto other vehicles and take control. With
  <em>
   Sleeping Dogs
  </em>
  going a long way in emulating the immaculate vibes of these old-school action movies, it's fascinating to see this action-packed driving be replicated in the game.

 <p>
  The floaty driving mechanics go a long way in making car chases more arcadey and memorable, with players being encouraged to ram vehicles to make the chase easier. Along with this, players can perform Action Hijacks by jumping out of their car and landing on others before taking control. It's a simple yet effective way to make driving sequences more engaging than most other open-world games and makes up for the questionable handling in most vehicles.

  Driving around Night City with cyberpunk aesthetics that aided in making Cyberpunk 2077 so iconic made the entire game more memorable than it already was. Night City was immersive, and stepping into the shoes of V, a merc on a time limit, made the impending sense of death seem all too real, with vehicular speed and action helping to take the edge off.

  The neon-soaked seats and cramped urban locales add to the wonder players experience while driving around in the vehicle of their choice, with motorbikes being especially beloved by the masses for letting them see their custom character from a third-person POV. Regardless of which vehicle players choose, zooming around the world and engaging in vehicle combat shows the strengths of

  's driving mechanics and why they deserve more credit now.

  Some demons do better than others when it comes to taking up the role of a buffer – a support demon that will increase ally stats or damage output. These are the best demons, depending on where the player is in the game to get to buff their allies.

  The Mermaid is a demon that can be uncooked at level 12 in
  <em>

  . This early-game demon can be quite useful for buffs as she has a support level of +2. She can get access to a skill known as Rakukaja +2 which allows her to raise the defense of one ally by one rank for 3 turns.

 <p>
  Ippon-Datara is a demon the player will be able to unlock by level 17 of the game. He has a support level of +2 and can access a good early-game buffing skill, Tarukaja. This allows him to increase the attack of one ally by one rank for 3 turns. This makes Ippon-Datara a good early-game buffing demon.

  Cironnup has one of the highest support levels the player can come across, at +4. This makes him one of the best buffing demons the player can find around mid-game, being unlockable at level 27.

  Jatayu is definitely a great demon for buffing that can be unlocked mid-game. This demon has a support level of +3 and can be accessed at level 32. He can buff all allies by using Masukukaja which increases their accuracy and evasion by one rank for 3 turns.

 <p>
  Konohana Sakuya is a DLC demon in
  <em>

  , meaning the player won’t be able to have access to her without buying the DLC. Konohana Sakuya is a great demon for buffing, having a base level of 50, and a support level of +3. Her unique skill Sakuya Sakura allows her to raise all stats of all allies for 3 turns while also healing the allies HP and restoring some MP.

  Alilat is an endgame demon that is definitely one of the best when it comes to healing and buffing. She’s unlocked at level 81 and has a support level of +3. She has access to 2 skills, Donum Magici and Donum Gladi. These skills allow her to increase the next magic or strength-based attack of an ally, depending on which she uses.

  Danu is a character that can be unlocked at level 93 and has a support level of +2. Her innate skill itself makes her very useful as a buffer as it allows her to weaken attacks that don’t strike the allies’ weakness if their defense is raised by 2 ranks. She also has access to Cluster Candy, which is a powerful buffing skill, and she has Matriarch’s Love which allows her to cure status ailments and remove rebuffs for all allies.

  Embercore Flowers are strange flaming buds which are located across Natlan in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  . They bloom upon being hit and their name derives from the flaming cores they have. These flowers also have Phlogiston particles, so when they are plucked can be used to restore your Phlogiston bar when needed.

 <p>
  There are only 29 Embercore Flowers in the area and most of them are pretty easy to collect. Most of them will be buds, so when farming, remember to hit them or use your Saurians attack to open it up. The flower will be in the middle to grab. This guide will follow the best route available to collect all of the flowers in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  .

  Embercore Flower near a bush surrounded by some alpacas. From there, head to the next teleport waypoint

  Use the teleport waypoint closest to Teticpac Peak (
  <strong>
   north of the Statue of Seven)
  </strong>
  and glide down to find an Embercore Flower hidden behind some bushes. Next, teleport to the underground waypoint in Ameyalco Waters to grab the next
  <strong>
   six Embercore Flowers
  </strong>
  . You can just follow the above route shown since the area is filled with lava (liquid phlogiston) and pretty hard to traverse. Players can either use an Anemo character or the Koholasaurus in the area to navigate the waters.

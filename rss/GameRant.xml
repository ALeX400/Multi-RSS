      Sharpness Decorations help maintain weapon Sharpness, while Charge-Based Decorations boost charge rate and Elemental Decorations exploit monster weaknesses.

     <li>
      Ranged Decorations enhance Bowgun and Bow performance, and Attack Decorations offer basic boosts like Attack, Critical Boost, and Critical Element.

  There are fourteen weapons in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  , all of which can follow a multitude of branching upgrade trees. Eventually, players can put items into weapons, if they have empty slots, called
  <strong>
   Decorations
  </strong>
  . Decorations, or Jewels as they are more commonly itemized in the game, are a good way to customize weapons more thoroughly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each Decoration has an accompanying skill, and some of the best Decorations even have two. One skill won’t necessarily translate to all weapons, as ranged benefits won’t help out melee weapons and vice sersa. These are
  <strong>
   the best Decorations to slot into weapons that cater to a wide range of
  </strong>
  <strong>
   co-op and single-player builds
  </strong>
  , so hopefully, every type of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  player can gain something from this breakdown.

  Most bladed weapons in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds,
  </em>
  from Dual Blades to Great Swords, have to be sharpened upon extended use. It’s a necessity to keep these weapons at full strength, and thankfully, there are a few weapon Decorations that can help keep their Sharpness up. The Grinder Jewel, for example, has the Speed Sharpening skill, which speeds up how fast players can sharpen weapons with a Whetstone. The Sharp Jewel has the Protective Polish skill attached, and this will keep weapons at peak Sharpness for a longer time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Razor Sharp Jewel has an aptly-named Razor Sharp skill, which gives players a chance at not losing Sharpness from normal attacks. The Mastery Jewel and its Master’s Touch skill have a similar effect in that there is an 80% chance a weapon will not lose Sharpness during a critical attack. Finally, if players don’t want to waste time sharpening weapons all day, they can equip the Blunt Jewel, which has the Bludgeoner skill. This will increase attack power if their Sharpness levels are low, which lessens the effects of fighting a monster without a sharp weapon.

  Most weapons in the game can be charged for a powerful attack, but some weapons stay charged for a set amount of time, such as
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds’
  </em>
  Charge Blade, and all of these Decorations will help with either scenario. The Focus Jewel has the Focus skill, and this will increase the charge rate of weapons so that players aren’t as vulnerable while they are powering up Goku-style.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Charge Jewel has Charge Master attached, and this skill will build up elemental power if the equipped weapon has any. For example, if a Charge Blade has the Dragon element in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , it will unleash that potential on top of charging the weapon's normal attack. Finally, there is the Enhancer Jewel and the Power Prolonger skill. This will increase how long Charge Blades, Dual Blades, Insect Glaives, Long Swords, and Switch Axes stay charged up.

 <p>
  There are five elements in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  : Dragon, Fire, Ice, Thunder, and Water. It’s best for players to go into a fight with the right Decoration equipped on their armor to prevent large amounts of health loss from these elements. For example, when facing a Blangonga, getting Ice-resistant Decorations is a plus. However, Blangonga is also weak to Fire damage, which is why the Blaze Jewel will be an essential Decoration for a weapon when hunting this monster. All five elements have an accompanying Decoration that will boost elemental damage, with the Blaze Jewel boosting Fire-based damage via the Fire Attack skill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should also look out for the Bolt Jewel, Dragon Jewel, Frost Jewel, and Stream Jewel to boost damage from the other elements. When trying to figure out which monster is weak to (or strong against) which element, they should check the Guidebook in the menu to find tons of relevant information. Players can even see where elements will specifically do the most damage. For example, players should target Blangonga’s head or torso to do the most damage with their Fire-based attacks.

 <p>
  The Bowgun and the Bow are two of the easiest weapons to control for beginners in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  . That’s why it seems like a good idea to highlight some Decorations that will help both ranged weapons out. The Bandolier Jewel comes with the Tetrad Shot skill, which increases the Bowgun’s Affinity with ammo. Affinity can increase the chances of scoring critical hits or help players naturally handle their weapons better.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Forceshot Jewel has the Normal Shots skill, which will naturally increase the attack power of all normal-based or non-elemental ammo for a Bowgun. The Opener Jewel has the Opening Shot skill attached, which will increase the power of Bowgun ammo when the weapon is full and also increase how fast players can reload. The Trueshot Jewel has Special Ammo Boost, which increases the attack power of special ammo, including elemental ammo, and it applies to Bows, too. Finally, the best Decoration for both weapons is the Precise Jewel, which has the Ballistics skill, which extends the weapon's range of effectiveness, meaning that players can do deadly damage from further away.

 <p>
  At the end of the day, many RPG fans just want their numbers to go up when crafting a new weapon in a game like
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  . That’s why these Decorations are some of the best for basic stat boosts. The Attack Jewel has Attack Boost, which will increase the attack power of a weapon naturally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Critical Jewel has Critical Boost, which will increase how much damage a critical attack can do. Combining that Decoration with the Expert Jewel would be wise, as it has the Critical Eye skill attached. This will raise a weapon’s Affinity and thus increase how often a critical attack can occur. Finally, for elemental fans out there, Crit Element Jewel has Critical Element on it, which will increase critical damage based on the weapon's elemental attacks, from Dragon to Water.

  Super Styles are unlocked to players who have purchased the Chapter 6 Season 2 Battle Pass for 1,000 V-Bucks or via the Fortnite Crew monthly subscription. Those with the Premium Battle Pass will then need to ensure that they have unlocked all rewards in the Battle Pass itself, which is a total of 100 levels. Then, players must claim all pages on the Bonus Rewards, which will require 70 levels (2 levels per reward). After which, the final 3 pages will unlock for players to work their way through.

 <p>
  First seen during the prologue of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , Katherine is a character whom many players will have had their eye on, and thankfully, she is one of the characters who can be romanced in the game.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  However,
  <strong>
   romancing Katherine in
   <em>
    KCD2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not easy and will require players to
  <strong>
   reach one of the last main quests
  </strong>
  in the story. Throughout the game, Henry will need to stay in her good books,
  <strong>
   flirt when possible
  </strong>
  , and complete the important side quest,
  <strong>
   The Fifth Commandment
  </strong>
  .

  <li>
   Boost Charisma by wearing nice clothes, cleaning, and wearing perfume.

   Improve Henry's Speech by talking to more people and reading skill books for Speech.

   started by talking to Katherine at the Hangman's Halter Tavern
  </strong>
  in Kuttenberg.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the quest, always try to
  <strong>
   side with Katherine
  </strong>
  , especially when talking as three with Lumir. One way to gain a significant amount of reputation with her is to
  <strong>
   allow Katherine to end the murderer's life
  </strong>
  .

     This is a timed quest and must be completed before the main story progresses away from Kuttenberg as Katherine moves. Jan Zizka will thankfully warn players of this.

  The chance to finally romance Katherine is available during the siege of Suchdol, more specifically, at the end of the
  <strong>
   Hunger and Despair quest
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Before being sent with Sam to escape the castle during the Reckoning quest, Jan Zizka will offer to tell Henry something about Katherine's past. After listening, players can then find her
  <strong>
   crying by the wounded soldiers
  </strong>
  . If players have a high enough reputation with her, a
  <strong>
   dialogue option with a heart
  </strong>
  will appear.
 </p>

  <li>
   I'll bring help, and everything will be alright again.

 <p>
  If this option
  <strong>
   doesn't appear

  Katherine during this playthrough.

      <title>Split Fiction's Success Should Inspire More Genre-Bending Video Games</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Split Fiction
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings players a fun-filled co-op experience, but one of the shining points of the game is how well it blends multiple genres. The most blatant genre-swap is the game's central premise of bouncing back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi worlds, but there is even more hidden underneath the main schtick. At many points throughout the story,
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  feels like a love letter to gaming in general.
 </p>

  Developer Hazelight Studios has fit a myriad of fun references throughout the game, and some of these fun Easter eggs actually help drive home the genre-bending qualities of
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  that much more. Hazelight Studios has already proven itself as a standout studio with its co-op focus, but even single-player games could learn a valuable lesson from
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  's unapologetic experimentation with genres.

  Protagonists Mio and Zoe Represent Two Different Worlds
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Mio prefers to write stories set in sci-fi worlds.
  </li>
  <li>
   Zoe prefers to write about fantasy.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These two genres are often seen as polar opposites, but
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  wonderfully demonstrates that opposite doesn't have to mean ill-fitting. Between the beautifully crafted fantasy worlds that Zoe has imagined and the neon-filled sci-fi settings created by Mio,
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  showcases that these genres are more like two sides of the same coin instead of two worlds that are completely foreign to one another. Mio and Zoe's journey and backstories are more similar than one might think at the beginning of the game, and the differing level genres help drive that point home even further.
 </p>
 <p>
  The genre-bending doesn't just stop at the constantly-changing levels, though. Within each level there are nods to other beloved games that allow the sci-fi and fantasy levels to lean into their respective genres even harder. A futuristic nod to the
  <em>
   SSX
  </em>
  snowboarding franchise, an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  reference, and a wonderfully blatant shout-out to the iconic
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  bonfire showcase the genres in unique and fun ways.

     Split Fiction also references Hazelight Studios' other games,
     <em>
      It Takes Two
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      A Way Out
     </em>
     . The former's character, Cutie the Elephant, and
     <em>

  If Hazelight Studios is anything, it's inventive, and
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  proves that the studio still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve. So far, the reception to
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  has been strong, and it will be fascinating to see how the co-op title influences other games down the road. It's bound to inspire other co-op titles, but it could also be a great source of inspiration for single-player projects, too. Combining multiple genres into one story can work wonders if done well, and it would be exciting to see a rise in single-player stories taking the same road as

  Split Fiction Makes its Mark in a Huge Year For Gaming

 <p>
  Right now, 2025 is stacked with major releases, and
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  is a fun addition to the continuously growing list. Between
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Shadows
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  , and the hugely-anticipated
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , the industry is launching offerings for nearly every type of gamer.
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  being in this mix makes it that much more powerful, because it boasts two major genres while also having the uniqueness of purely being co-op. Following Hazelight Studios' last game,
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  , was not an easy task, but
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  has been a strong successor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, only time will tell how
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  influences other projects, if at all. Even if it doesn't inspire other games to play around with opposing genres, Hazelight Studios' new release is a great showcase of how two differing themes can actually balance each other out.

  The next
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield
   </strong>
  </em>
  game has had more gameplay footage leaked during its closed playtest period, revealing several new key game mechanics. EA is moving forward with an all-new
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  after the less-than-stellar
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  disappointed many fans at launch in 2021. Despite developer DICE nursing the game back to a positive standing over the following years, EA pulled the plug on the game, which enjoyed its final season titled "Turning Point" last year. It's since been confirmed that the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game will return to a modern setting, harkening back to the more beloved
  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  EA's first round of its Battlefield Labs closed playtests kicked off last week and has been the subject of much discussion among multiplayer gaming fans. Despite signing NDA agreements, it seems a number of participants have violated the terms, as copious footage of the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game has started to appear online. EA doesn't seem to be too bothered by the leaks, as they've attracted tons of positive attention from
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  fans who seem to like what they've been seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  As new
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  leaks keep coming out, fans have been spotting a number of intriguing new gameplay mechanics. For one, Twitter user Synth Potato marveled at the destruction on display in one particular clip that saw a building violently and loudly crumbling to the ground, putting it on par with fan-favorite entry
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  News Twitter account also weighed in with more clips that seem to showcase interesting new features, like the ability to drag downed teammates to a safer spot for revival, or being flung several feet back by a sniper round to the chest. A Reddit user named Krochi_123 believes they've spotted a player hanging off the back of a tank in a freeze-frame shot, though some believe it could just be a simple enter/exit animation.

  Battlefield Gameplay Leaks Reveal New Mechanics
 </h2>
 <p>
  The responses to some of these new
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  mechanics will certainly be interesting to see. Some fans don't believe the ability to drag downed teammates will be utilized enough, as the number of players contributing to matches as medics going around healing and reviving teammates is unfortunately small to begin with. That said, for players who do like playing medics, it seems like a nifty way to pull off safer resuscitations if no smoke grenades are handy. As for the dramatic sniper knockback animation, it's important to note that it seems it can trigger even if the bullet doesn't kill the player. This could turn out to be a source of frustration for some fans, who might not like such a harsh penalty for surviving a sniper shot.

  With Battlefield Labs playtests still ongoing, more footage may be leaked online by NDA-breaking participants. Whether EA makes an effort to have the footage wiped from the internet remains to be seen. With the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  expected to release before March 2026, fans might expect the game to have its full unveiling at Geoff Keighley's upcoming Summer Game Fest in June, perhaps with an official title reveal and release date.

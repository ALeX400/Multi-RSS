   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  has many side quests that can only be unlocked after players explore a region fully. It might feel time-consuming, but the rewards are plenty, making it worth the effort.

  In order to begin the side quest,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  players need to
  <strong>
   reach the Forest of Felicity Keeper's Shrine
  </strong>
  . Just ahead of the shrine, there is a wooden gate with a body. Go forth and talk to it. After finishing the conversation, players will learn how the fox was slaughtered by a scholar-turned-monk. The fox will give you
  <strong>
   the Snow Fox Brush
  </strong>
  and tell you the monk is in New Thunderclap Temple. Examine the body again, and you will be transformed into a fox.

  Your destination is the New Thunderclap Temple, but you won't be able to access the location until after beating a boss. For the fight, you will want to transform back into your original form. The boss isn't too difficult, and players should be able to take it down within a couple of attempts.

  Next,
  <strong>
   activate the Temple Entrance Keeper's Shrine
  </strong>
  and take a right. As you move forward, two big staircases will barge into view.

   <em>

  brought a sprawling dystopian setting to life with Night City, but the sequel may be taking the franchise's story to a new location. As the development for its sequel, Project Orion, kicks off, the future of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  may be found outside the iconic city.

 <p>
  Despite Project Orion only being in its early stages, there are plenty of rumors and points of speculation about what the sequel's story and world will entail. Although CD Projekt Red hasn't confirmed much at this point, one theory has been suggesting that Project Orion could take place on the moon. This would indeed be a bold new direction for the series, but it isn't too far out of the realm of possibility. In
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , there is indeed a colony on the moon. It simply hasn't been seen yet. Project Orion taking place on the moon is a fascinating idea, but the sequel should avoid leaving Night City behind, at least entirely.

  Phantom LIberty Showcasing Unexplored Parts of Night City
 </h3>
 <p>
  Last year's
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  DLC brought an incredible breath of fresh air to
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  . For an expansion,
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  was incredibly intricate and could even change how the game ultimately ends. However, one of the most compelling aspects of this DLC was the introduction of Dogtown. Even in the base game, Night City is full of life, as there are fascinating things to explore around nearly every corner. However, the addition of Dogtown was a game changer.

 <p>
  Dogtown is a lawless walled-off area of Night City full of crime and those wishing to live outside the confines of the metropolis. Ruled by militia leader Kurt Hansen, Dogtown is an area of Night City that now feels like it is a necessary piece of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's world.
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  made
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  feel like a complete game, and there is plenty of opportunity for Project Orion to explore more potential areas in Night City that have yet to be showcased.

 <p>
  Thanks to
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  , it isn't hard to believe that Dogtown isn't the only area of Night City that has tried to separate itself from that society. Project Orion could open the doors for another society living on the outskirts that could be the polar opposite of Dogtown. A potential commune or individuals who wish to live a tech-free life could be a compelling contrast to the fast-paced tech-heavy world of Night City. However, depending on how far into the future Project Orion goes with its story, another way to show Night City in a new light could be just as fascinating.

 <p>
  At the moment, it is unclear where Project Orion will pick up
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's story. It could be right after the finale, but it is more likely that there will be somewhat of a time jump after the first game's events. Although it seems as though V's story has come to an end, the changes that have taken place in Night City after his journey would be a great way to recycle the setting while also keeping it fresh. The shifts in power that are bound to happen in Night City after
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  could reshape its society in new ways. It would also be incredibly fun to visit familiar locations from
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , only to find out that they have been drastically changed by new leadership.

  It's exciting to speculate about what Project Orion could have in store for players. Even if the sequel opens up the story's boundaries with travel to the moon colony, it doesn't exactly need to be the star of the show. Venturing to new areas in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's lore is essential for the franchise's growth, but as the heart of the series, Night City needs to play at least a small part in future stories.

  A rare
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  skin bundle, the Mogul Masters pack, has finally appeared in the game's item shop again after over a year and a half, giving players another chance to grab it before it cycles out of the shop again. The skins are available individually for 1,500 V-bucks, the premium in-game currency in
  <em>
   Fortnite,
  </em>
  or as a bundle for a discounted price of 2,100 V-bucks.

 <p>
  There are a massive amount of skins available in both the
  <em>
  </em>
  item shop and the battle pass which players can unlock either by buying them or grinding out their player level with in-game challenges. Either way, many of them often end up showing up only on rare occasions, as the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  item shop cycles out on a routine basis to provide new skins and cosmetics for players to buy each day.

  Known
  <em>
  </em>
  leaker ShiinaBR confirmed on Twitter Saturday that the Mogul Masters
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins had returned to the shop, which are fairly popular and highly sought-after due to how rare they are. The skins, depicted in the screenshot accompanying the tweet, depict athletes wearing bright and colorful skiing uniforms, in male and female forms with multiple style options with different countries' flags on them.

 <p>
  Aside from just the outfits, the Mogul Masters skins also come with exclusive back blings in the form of skis that adorn players' backs as they battle and explore the island in
  <em>
   Fortnite.
  </em>
  Though it is not clear how long the skins will remain in the shop, limited-time bundles usually stick around for a few days, so players still have a little more time to deck themselves out and take on Dr. Doom and Mysterio in the current
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  season.

 <p>
  Response to the skins' return was mostly positive in the tweet's replies, though some players stated that they thought the timing was strange for winter-themed skins since it's still summertime in much of the world, but were still excited since they are relatively rare. Regardless, the Mogul Masters were one of the more popular
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins when they first debuted due to their patriotic designs.

  Rare skins are a dime in a dozen in
  <em>
   Fortnite,
  </em>
  and many of them become huge commodities as a result, as it is never a guarantee when they might come back to the shop down the line. Some skins, like one based on the Psycho from
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , rarely make an appearance, while some
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins have spent years away from the shop with no sign of returning any time soon.

  's Shattered Space DLC releases September 30, taking players to the home of House Va'ruun. There, they will become embroiled in the politics of Va'ruun'kai, be directly exposed to the lore and mythologies surrounding the Great Serpent, and be treated to a hand-designed planet with a unique horror emphasis. It's very clear that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space DLC has a stronger horror vibe than the base game, but it's clear there's more to it than just that after a recent presentation at Gamescom.

  Starfield's Search for Knowledge
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's central theme has always been the exploration of the galaxy, the search for knowledge among the stars. In an established universe, however, many
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  denizens have all but given up this quest, leaving only Constellation to seek this knowledge. This results in the main mission leading players to The Unity and learning about the Starborn, the multiverse, and the reality they live in. While not as grandiose, Starfield's factions are also about this search for knowledge.

  <em>
   Starfield

  's United Colonies questline sees players search for knowledge surrounding the Terrormorph attacks, what the Terrormorphs are, and Vae Victis (Francoise Sanon). The Crimson Fleet questline sees players enter the conflict between the titular pirates and UC SysDef, while searching for the truth of Kryx's Legacy. Ryujin Industries is all about megacorps in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , but it's still about the search for Project Dominion. The Freestar Collective questline searches for the truth behind a grand conspiracy involving The First and Ron Hope. While each tackles the theme differently, every questline utilizes the search for knowledge as a general approach - and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space twists that for its horror tone.

  Starfield's Shattered Space DLC Twists The Search for Knowledge
 </h2>
 <p>
  There's a lot of content coming in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space DLC. As players arrive on Va'ruun'kai, they become involved in a conflict between the sub-factions within House Va'ruun, all of which are competing for leadership. The player is somehow directly involved, and that connection is seemingly involved with The Great Serpent. House Va'ruun is one of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's biggest mysteries, and it seems the story and gameplay perform a deep dive into their organization, their ancient-feeling religion, and their various oddities. As players sneak around, engage in combat, and in turn get surprised by enemies, that mystery is what's going to keep them going. But what really caught our eye about all this is that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space DLC is about when the search for knowledge goes wrong.

 <p>
  Although unconfirmed, it seems unlikely that this is specifically the player's search for knowledge surrounding House Va'ruun gone wrong but something that House Va'ruun has done instead. It's most likely this theme is tied to the current hopeless, alien feel that surrounds the planet's abysmal state, but it could also apply to the power struggle and politics or to the religion as a whole. Combined with the horror vibes, it's almost like the antithesis of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Constellation. It wasn't perfect, but its search for knowledge was pure. It seems that, whatever search for knowledge is at the heart of Shattered Space, it's gone horribly, horribly wrong.

 <p>
  Compared to other questlines, that's a refreshing direction however it manifests exactly. It's also a great proposition for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's future and how it can explore its content and central theme in a variety of ways, especially with a Year 2 of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  content planned. For now, House Va'ruun remains shrouded in mystery - but that curtain is coming down soon. Whatever players learn, it's likely not to be good for Va'ruun'kai but good for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  and its community.

  players must build and maintain a variety of districts in order to supply New London with crucial resources. While these districts work in most circumstances, they operate more efficiently and result in fewer negative consequences when players use the Synergy system.

  However, the synergy system is not explained in detail anywhere in the game's tutorials. As such, which districts and hubs have specific effect is difficult for new players to figure out. Keep reading for details on all of the most common
  <strong>
   synergy modifiers for Districts and Hubs
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , as well as how to best utilize them.

  District Synergy is a mechanic in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  that
  <strong>
   gives modifiers to a district depending on where it is placed
  </strong>
  . A number of things can effect district synergy, including terrain, hubs, buildings, and other districts. Synergy modifiers can be positive or negative, so players need to be aware of different synergy effects for the best city performance.

 <p>
  The most common synergy is a reduction in the amount of heating required, as this bonus is available to districts whenever they are placed close together or in natural dips in terrain. However, players will also occasionally encounter an increase in the heating required modifier, most notably when building on the top of a hill.

 <p>
  In order to receive a given synergy modifier, a district must have at least
  <strong>
   three tiles in range of the other building/terrain
  </strong>
  . Placing more than three tiles in the range of a single building has no further effect. However, bonuses of the same type stack when received from different sources. As a result, players can build housing districts to receive two required heating reductions and thus buff the required heating to zero. Alternatively, players can accidentally increase their squalor by placing a Housing District between two Industrial Districts.

    <p>
     Costs of districts cannot be reduced below zero, so there are (for instance) no further bonuses for sheltering a housing district further when the heating required is already at zero. As a result, it is usually better to avoid more than three tiles in proximity, ensuring room for more districts with good synergy bonuses.

 <p>
  Active Synergy Effects can be checked in one of two ways. Players can either
  <strong>
   hold down the 8 key
  </strong>
  in order to view the building effects tab. Alternatively, every effect currently active in a district can be seen by clicking on it and then hovering over the icons under Area Effect.

  <strong>
   Stamina Recovery Rate

  A solid Stamina Recovery Rate is crucial for new players starting their journey westward in

  . It forms a strong foundation for any viable build in the game, enabling players to replenish their stamina much faster after it's been depleted. This allows The Destined One to get right back to doing what they do best: hitting things with a pole. Let's look at how players can get their Stamina Recovery Rate up to scratch.

 <p>
  This is the earliest way players can improve their Stamina Recovery Rate. Being a foundation skill,
  <strong>
   Everlasting Vigor
  </strong>
  can essentially be unlocked with the player's second Spark. It's hard to miss, but it can easily go overlooked given how much more appealing and flashy some of the other early-game skills can look.

 <p>
  Though not as 'cool' as other skills players can level into in their early hours of play, it's vital. It has a low unlock cost and is easy to obtain. Even though it's not a significant improvement, it's a noticeable start.

  It can be upgraded up to six times, though each time this talent is awakened, it will cost players 2 sparks. It can become slightly more costly in the long run, but remember, Sparks can be returned to the player at any time, so if a specific build isn't working out, it can always be reset.

  <strong>
   Swift Bat
  </strong>
  is the best spirit for players looking for the least amount of downtime against the disparaging Tiger Vanguard. The passive boost to Stamina Recovery is great, and the Spirit Vessel attack is a solid bonus for that extra bit of damage.

  Players will need Mind Cores to unlock them, a valuable resource in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong,

  and Celestial Pills become increasingly expensive the more players wish to upgrade a certain skill. Xu Dog's crafting station will most likely become the go-to for players wishing to upgrade this stat as they find themselves traveling further west. Though mind cores are rare, they can, at certain points, be purchased from Shrines or Xu Dog himself - for a price.

  <strong>
   Focused Breath
  </strong>
  is great for keeping the pressure on at the start of fights. When The Destined One's health is above half, there is a noticeable increase in the speed of the player's Stamina Recovery Rate.

 <p>
  Though the effect obviously dissipates once health is lowered below 50%, a few swigs of a Gourd can get this effect straight back into full swing. Anyone looking to get the most out of their Stamina should dedicate their trusty Sparks to awakening this talent.

  Whether it's a quick rebuttal attack or just dodging away, the
  <strong>
   Non-Void Spirit
  </strong>
  will no doubt bring some fights back from the brink, providing The Destined One with that much-needed bit of extra stamina. Though it's not recommended for players to take damage, it's unavoidable; at least this Spirit softens the blow.

  One of the most powerful Vessels that players will obtian along their journey in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is the
  <strong>
   Plantain Fan
  </strong>
  . Though not usable until the final chapter of the game, its attack becomes invaluable against bosses, essentially stun-locking them upon use, allowing
  <em>
   The Destined One
  </em>
  to get some valuable attacks in.

  <strong>
   The Equipped effect acts as a powerful buff to Stamina Recovery Rate

  The next mainline
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game has yet to be announced, but given there are usually several years between games and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
  </strong>
  only launched last year, it will likely still be at least another year or two before anything about
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 17
  </em>
  surfaces. Regardless, it's worth considering how
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  's drastic shift in formula might affect the next game, as there are plenty of things it could draw inspiration from that have been both loved and hated by the fan base.

 <p>
  Despite
  <em>

  's divisiveness, some parts of it are universally received. One feature, in particular, is something

  Torgal Is a Fan-Favorite Animal Companion From Final Fantasy 16
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series and its protagonists have seen no shortage of animal companions, but no installment has implemented one quite like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  . Torgal is Clive Rosfield's lovable, furry wolf companion who remains by his side throughout the majority of the game, assisting him in combat and occasionally chiming in with a bark when spoken to. What sets Torgal apart is his unbridled loyalty to the protagonist, and his ability to fight without direction — although players can still issue commands to Torgal during combat if they wish. Since his introduction, he has become a fan-favorite character, so the only way forward seems to be to include a similar companion in the next game.

  Final Fantasy 17's Protagonist Should Have Their Own Torgal-Like Animal Companion
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  has broken ground for it,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 17
  </em>
  shouldn't forego giving its protagonist an adorable animal companion like Torgal. This would give players another round of what they got with Torgal in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  , as well as potentially expound on Torgal's unique additions to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  's gameplay.

 <p>
  The only issue
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 17
  </em>
  would need to resolve is the fact that many fans weren't happy with Clive being the only playable character in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  , and that's likely the only way the next installment could get a Torgal-like companion to work. If the next
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  went back to a traditional party setup where the player controls each character, a new animal companion might be nothing more than another
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  Khumari or
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  Cait Sith. As such,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 17
  </em>
  would need to lean into what makes Torgal a unique animal companion in the series.

  Firstly, Torgal doesn't speak, nor does he walk upright, unlike almost every other animal companion in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series. He is, in every way, an animal, and that is ultimately what sets him apart from the rest. Since Torgal is strictly an animal, players can bond with him in a much different way than they can with others like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's Red XIII or
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  's Freya. Secondly, players can complete special quests for Torgal in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  that strengthen Clive's bond with him and unlock his potential in combat.

  It's unclear whether

  's protagonist will get their own animal companion, or whether it will adopt any of
  <em>

  </em>
  's features at all. Nevertheless, as Torgal has proven to be a fan-favorite companion among the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  community, it would be a shame not to include a similar character in the next installment. Of course,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 17
  </em>
  will need to first consider what it is that makes Torgal unique among the rest.

  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , the long-awaited sequel to 2018’s award-winning city-building survival game, is now available on PC for
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  subscribers to enjoy. Given the recent changes to Microsoft’s subscription service, only Ultimate and PC Game Pass members will be able to access the game at no additional cost, though it is also available for purchase.

  11 Bit Studios’
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is set in an alternate history early 20th century, 30 years after an apocalyptic blizzard has plunged the world into a never-ending volcanic winter. The first game had the player leading a group of survivors and establishing a stronghold in the harsh, wintery environment. In the sequel, the people have grown more confident and their contentious natures have begun to rise to the surface as their ambitions threaten the stability of the city of New London.

  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  will be the fifth title to launch day one on Xbox Game Pass in September. Though the game is in development for Xbox Series X/S,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  won't release on consoles until 2025. So, for now at least, only the PC version will be available for Game Pass subscribers. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, because the highly detailed city-builder is very well suited for control with a mouse and keyboard.

  In
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  2, players will have to deal with the constant needs of a growing population in the middle of a snowbound wasteland. There will be shortages of food, energy, and heating resources, as well as a constant need to expand housing and existing services like medicine and religion. At the same time, where there are people, there will be conflict. Various factions begin to form in
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  's New London, each with their own ideas of what’s important for the budding metropolis to focus on.

 <p>
  The campaign mode in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  takes 8 to 10 hours to beat, and the game also features a sandbox mode called Utopia Builder that allows players to select their starting communities and factions. The goal will be to simply survive for as long as possible. This mode expands on what was available in the original game, says 11 Studios, and paves the way for endless replayability.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  already has a “Mighty” rating on OpenCritic, with an average critic score of 86, so Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC subscribers have plenty to be excited about.

 <p>
  However, there’s even more to look forward to, as Oxide Games’
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  will be launching day one on Xbox Game Pass on September 24. The turn-based strategy game also takes players to an alternate history, where they will build monuments, develop cultures, and lead a nation to the “pinnacles of human achievement.”

  All game modes will still revolve around Frank West surviving in the zombie-infested mall, but later game modes will give more freedom which also is great for players trying to get all the achievements. Here we'll get into how long players can expect to spend in the game depending on what you're looking to get out of it.

  Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster's main story mode is the 72-Hour mode which functions on an in-game clock of 72 hours. Outside of menus and cutscenes, the timer will continue to progress in real-time, with every few minutes being an in-game hour. Because of this, players can expect to spend
  <strong>
   roughly six hours on the 72-hour mode of the game
  </strong>
  if they play every in-game minute.

  While that is the most you can get out of a playthrough, there are ways for you to speed up time and make a playthrough shorter should you want to quickly get to one of the multiple endings.
  <strong>
   Depending on your choices, there are multiple endings
  </strong>
  to get, leading to a decent amount of replayability or at least saving and going back to make different decisions.

  After completing the 72-hour mode, players will unlock Overtime mode, which
  <strong>
   adds an additional 24 hours of in-game time and another 2 or 3 hours
  </strong>
  of playtime. After completing Overtime, you'll unlock Infinite Mode, which adds an
  <strong>
   unlimited number of hours of playtime if you want
  </strong>
  . For those trying to complete every achievement in the game, there is one for surviving seven days on Infinite Mode, meaning an additional 14-ish hours depending on how you play those days to get the trophy.

 <p>
  On top of those survival-focused trophies, many are fairly easy to get and will be done naturally while you play each game mode, with the leftovers being easily finished during the seven days in Infinite Mode. The ability to fast-forward time does make the time-specific trophies easier to get, and your overall playtime can vary greatly using that feature if you're able to get all the other trophies quickly.

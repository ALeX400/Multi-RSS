   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  has attracted a large pool of players by offering a vast roster of characters (from the highly acclaimed superhero franchise) paired with strong hero shooter mechanics. For some, collectible items and the hidden Easter eggs in the game will be equally compelling. The Celestial Codex is one of these tidbits, whose purpose remains shrouded in mystery, yet fans are eager to acquire it.

  The Celestial Codex appears in the Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface map of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . To be specific, players will find this massive mass in the Attacker Spawn. There’s a way to convert the Celestial Codex into a collectible item, and it requires
  <strong>
   spraying at the base of the giant mass
  </strong>
  . Doing so will also unlock the Veni Vidi V…? achievement in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The task is simple for an attacker, given the location is the spawn room. Just remember to put the spray down before the battle breaks out to avoid missing out. Make sure to complete the match, as
  <strong>
   leaving early will render the task incomplete
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The same rules apply to
  <strong>
   defenders
  </strong>
  aiming to unlock the Veni Vidi V…? achievement in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . Although they might have to jump through hoops, the task isn't at all impossible for them. The enemy spawn might be inaccessible at the beginning, so
  <strong>
   wait until the enemy captures the point
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The spawn will switch once they start pushing the convoy. Just sneak past the opponents to get to the Celestial Codex’s location. The actual challenge would be to avoid picking up a fight along the way. Heroes like the Invisible Woman or Loki will be ideal for the task as they can use their invisibility to move around the map undetected.

      <title>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2's Kreia Is Still One of The Franchise's Most Interesting Characters</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/star-wars-kotor-2-kreia-good-franchise-character-why/</link>

 <p>
  The world of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  is massive and includes many well-written characters that go overlooked, especially if they aren't included in the movies.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords
   </strong>
  </em>
  had one of the messiest releases of its time and was largely unfinished, had hours of cut content, and broken questlines. Despite these significant flaws,
  <em>
   Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords
  </em>
  is still hailed today as one of the best
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games thanks to the quality of its writing, its worldbuilding, and its characters.

 <p>
  One of the main characters in
  <em>
   Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords
  </em>
  is Kreia. The first party member the player character meets, Kreia fills the role of the old and wise Jedi Master. She teaches the player, advises them on the ways of the Force, and oftentimes offers her perspective on situations and their outcomes throughout the course of the game's story. This is made even better by the player character's Force Bond with Kreia, allowing them to share their thoughts, feelings, and possible mortality.

  Kreia's role as a mentor is clear, but she both serves the role and subverts it as she's one of
  <em>
   The Sith Lords
  </em>
  ' primary antagonists, having intentionally sought out the Jedi Exile in an attempt to bring about the death of the Force. The subversion of the mentor goes deeper than having failed students, and her teachings are blamed for the fall of numerous Jedi, including
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  's Revan, even if she wasn't a Sith Lord at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than a complete refutation of the lore that came before it,
  <em>
   The Sith Lords
  </em>
  instead takes
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  ' lore and examines it. At the end of
  <em>
   The Sith Lords
  </em>
  , the result is not a rejection of the philosophies of the Jedi and the Sith, but a more nuanced understanding of the lore that the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  movies and
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  introduced. This type of examination of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  lore has been done since
  <em>
   The Sith Lords
  </em>
  ' launch, but arguably these attempts have not been as effective, save for
  <em>
   The Clone Wars
  </em>
  ' TV series.

 <p>
  This dissection and examination of the Force is primarily carried through Kreia's arc and goals. Within her arc comes a blend of narrative and video game mechanics, where Kreia teaches the player to tap into the Force in new ways and becomes more powerful as a Force-user but, in doing so, also plays into Kreia's goal of destroying the Force.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     This creates an interesting dynamic between Kreia and the Jedi Exile as, for the most part, the Jedi Exile is very aware that Kreia is manipulating them, but accepts her for any number of reasons, from sympathy to care to necessity.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Kreia is genuinely a character that hadn't been seen before in
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  and has rarely been seen since. While Jolee Bindo from
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  was also something of a subversion of the wise mentor as a gray Force-user and an ex-Jedi, he still encouraged Light-sided actions. Rather than encouraging the Jedi Exile onto the path of the Light or Dark, Kreia truly wishes for the Jedi Exile to remain neutral, and disapproves of actions that are overtly good or cartoonishly evil.
 </p>
 <p>
  An attempt has been made to replicate Kreia's perspective with various jaded Jedi Masters, but always with a change of heart and an acceptance of the Jedi teachings at the end of their stories, making them less intriguing when compared to Kreia. Kreia's experiences informed her outlook, and her unique relationship with the player makes her a character that many remember even two decades later.

 <p>
  Most items in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  are dropped from various Loot Chests or spawn in the wild. But in the case of Lunar event items, everything is a little more complicated. To be more precise, to get Snake Talismans in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  , players simply need to defeat enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important to note that not every enemy will drop the desired Talismans but only enemies with a yellow aura can reward you with them. Often, these are strong curse users or bosses.
 </p>
 <p>
  As soon as you defeat an enemy with a yellow aura, you will receive the coveted Snake Talismans along with EXP. But of course, this is a rather slow process, since most times you will only receive a few Talismans. Each enemy type can drop different amounts of Snake Talismans in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    World bosses
   </strong>
   - Drop 10 Talismans
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Quest bosses
   </strong>
   - Drop 5 Talismans
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Elite enemies and bosses
   </strong>
   - Drop 2 Talismans
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To farm Snake Talismans in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  , you need to fight as many strong enemies as possible, and the best mode for this is Investigation. Also, do not forget to visit World Bosses that spawn every hour according to server time.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it is worth noting that the developers added a limit on the number of Snake Talismans received in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  . Therefore, players cannot receive more than 100 Talismans per 18 hours.

 <p>
  As for usage, Snake Talismans are only needed for exchange at the Black Market in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  . You will find this NPC in Zen Forest near the Curse Market. During the Lunar New Year event, players can purchase unique items there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them are customization items, such as the Lunar New Year 2025 Title. But you will also find more practical items in the assortment. We especially recommend you pay attention to the Snake Charm and the Red Suit of Good Luck.

      <title>In Defense of Lockpicking in Baldur's Gate 3</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Aside from passing a lockpick skill check, players can also open locked doors and containers in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  by casting the right Spell or destroying the locked object with brute force. Since all of these lockpicking methods in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  will lead to the same result, it’s understandable that players would want to choose the method that requires the least investment: destroying locked objects by attacking them.

 <p>
  With as many creative alternatives as there are to lockpicking in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , players may be hesitant to invest in a party member’s dedicated lockpicking proficiency. However, investing in lockpicking can be a useful asset to have in any party. More specifically, investing in Dexterity can have many benefits that can enhance any character’s build and provide useful opportunities for the players’ party in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , so players would be wise not to sleep on lockpicking.

 <p>
  While breaking open doors and containers with brute force will always be a cheap and reliable lockpicking method in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , there’s still plenty of merit to investing in the dedicated lockpicking skill. Even if not for the sake of lockpicking, investing in the primary ability that affects lockpicking, Dexterity, can provide several extra benefits.
 </p>
 <h3 id="ranged-weapons-shine-with-dexterity-builds-in-baldur-rsquo-s-gate-3">
  Ranged Weapons Shine With Dexterity Builds in Baldur’s Gate 3
 </h3>
 <p>
  Whether players are fully invested in a ranged-weapon build in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , or using ranged weapons as a backup for a melee build, having a few points in Dexterity can make all the difference in how often players will land their attacks with ranged weapons. Having powerful ranged attacks is a luxury that allows players to stay out of range of enemies with melee builds, often making enemies waste their turns in combat just to close the distance.

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Dexterity also affects a character’s attack rolls with Finesse weapons in

  Stealth in Baldur’s Gate 3 Can Be Overpowered in the Right Hands
 </h3>
 <p>
  In general, stealth builds in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  are both high-risk and high-reward. At the cost of not using some of the best heavy and medium armor in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , a stealth build can provide an advantage on attack rolls, override Initiative to surprise enemies and skip their first turn in combat, and allow players to avoid being directly targeted by certain incoming attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Outside of combat, pickpocketing in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  is also affected by Dexterity through the Sleight of Hand skill, and this can be a quick path to riches. Not only can pickpocketing allow players to obtain top-notch weapons and armor from NPC merchants for free, but a high enough skill proficiency can allow players to obtain more Thieves’ Tools, Trap Disarm Toolkits, Spell scrolls, and camp supplies than most players would ever legitimately use throughout a playthrough.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_12">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Players’ Sleight of Hand skill also affects their chances of disarming traps in

 <h3 id="lockpicking-in-baldur-rsquo-s-gate-3-has-a-low-skill-ceiling">
  Lockpicking in Baldur’s Gate 3 Has a Low Skill Ceiling
 </h3>
 <p>
  While investing in high Dexterity can naturally provide separate benefits to a character and the overall party, lockpicking in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  generally doesn’t require high investment to begin with. As long as players have Thieves’ Toolkits in their inventory, players can generally continue to attempt to pick a lock even after failing the skill check, which is quite a generously low skill ceiling.
 </p>
 <h3 id="dexterity-in-baldur-rsquo-s-gate-3-is-a-versatile-ability">
  Dexterity in Baldur’s Gate 3 Is a Versatile Ability
 </h3>
 <p>
  Especially if they are already planning on using ranged weapons, finesse weapons, and/or stealth builds in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , players will likely already have more than enough Dexterity to have a sufficient lockpicking skill. In hindsight, while lockpicking may not be a vital skill on its own compared to some of the other creative ways to open locks, investing in proper lockpicking synergizes with multiple game-changing skills that arguably make it a worthwhile investment nonetheless.

  despite so much of the franchise's attention being placed on the upcoming
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , with Rockstar clearly not being finished with its massively successful multiplayer experience. Consistent content updates for
  <em>

  The most recent update for
  <em>

  franchise. The Lunar New Year event for

  The Lunar New Year event for
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  lasts until February 12, with Rockstar slowly releasing sets of unique rewards over the next few weeks to keep fans engaged and earning throughout the event. As 2025 is the Year of the Snake in Chinese astrology, a lot of
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  's Lunar New Year rewards are marked with snake motifs, giving a stylish and memorable theme to this year's celebrations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the most exciting Lunar New Year content for
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  comes with the addition of brand-new Stunt Races themed around the event, with players using nitrous to speed through lantern-filled streets in high-octane holiday fun. These specific races offer double RP and GTA$ throughout the event's tenure, with players also being gifted a free Lunar New Year livery for the Maibatsu Penumbra FF car after playing any of these Stunt Races before February 12.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lunar New Year has also had a tangible impact on the main map of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  thanks to the event's Yuanbao collectibles, with players having to scour Los Santos for 36 well-hidden secrets. Players receive a nice dose of RP and GTA$ for each collectible, with the collection of all 36 coming with a hefty cash reward plus the Gold Snake Santo Capra Outfit. Players can make finding these collectibles a bit easier in-game by upgrading the Benefactor Terrorbyte with the newly added Collectible Scanner, making Yuanbao completion a much more manageable task.

 <p>
  Throughout the Lunar New Year event, players will be given a wide range of themed clothing items simply by logging into
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  before February 12. In all, players can earn the following Lunar New Year cosmetics:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Black Snake Yogarishima Outfit
  </li>
  <li>
   Red Serpent Leather Jacket
  </li>
  <li>
   Snake Soul Pendant

  <li>
   Red Snake Soul Cap
  </li>
  <li>
   Gray Snake King Cap

 </ul>
 <p>
  Even away from content that has been added purely for the Lunar New Year event, the celebrations come with bonuses that are applicable to a lot of pre-existing
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  content. For example, a huge amount of Nightclub bonuses have been added thanks to the Lunar New Year event, with players receiving double GTA$ on Nightclub Daily Income as well as GTA$, RP, and goods on Nightclub Goods Missions throughout the event. Players should also be on the lookout for sizable discounts on properties throughout the Lunar New Year event, with Rockstar also cycling different sales for other things like luxury cars, aircraft, and gun van items every week until February 12.

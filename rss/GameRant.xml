    Black Myth: Wukong

  is not a souls-like through and through, but it isn't devoid of elements from the particular genre. Players have to fight against tough bosses, look for quests on their own, and figure out solutions without too many clues.

  In most souls-like games, players are given the opportunity to pick a certain build for their character that they will use for the rest of the game.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  does not have the same level of freedom, but players can customize their character's skills, stances, and spells to maximize damage output.

  Depending on whether players bought the regular or the deluxe version, they will have different starting weapons. But it shouldn't make too much difference. To simplify things, the build guide has been divided into different sections, so everything can be explained fully. The main focus will be on these things:

  . However, it cannot be obtained unless players have paid for the Deluxe Edition of the game or bought the separate add-on. So,

  The armor constitutes headgear, chest, arms, and leg pieces. In the early stages of the game, players will have to make do with what they can get. Starting with headgear, players can

   Gray Wolf Mask

  , which is obtained after beating Lingxuzi inside Ancient Guanyin Temple. For the rest, players can craft the Serpentscale Armor. It is a brilliant set that can be a real lifesaver in the early stages of the game.

  The

  There are many skills in the game, so it can be rather confusing which ones to unlock. As the bosses are tough, players should focus on increasing their health, as it will enable them to withstand more hits. So, players need to unlock a

  Players will unlock the first transformation fairly early in Chapter 1. All they need to do is
  <strong>
   beat Guangzhi
  </strong>
  , and they will obtain the power to morph into the beast. This transformation is splendid in more ways than one. Players don't lose too much speed, and their attacks deal a truckload of damage. Moreover, it causes Burn build-up which leads to enemies losing HP continuously. This,
  <strong>
   combined with the Cat's Eye Beads
  </strong>
  can make the early game bosses a lot easier.

   Wandering Wight
  </span>
  is one of the earliest bosses in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , but its Spirit offers one of the best moves. Whenever players
  <strong>
   use Wandering Wight
  </strong>
  in combat, it will deal a decent amount of
  <strong>
   damage to the enemy
  </strong>
  and also
  <strong>
   stun them
  </strong>
  for a short time. This could come in handy in situations where players have their backs against the wall.

      <title>How Star Wars Eclipse Could Behave Like a Spiritual Successor to The Acolyte</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  ' TV output has been pretty divisive so far, and that's putting it mildly. Back in November 2019,
  <em>
  </em>
  Disney debuted its first season of
  <em>
   The Mandalorian
  </em>
  , and it was met with positive reviews across the board.
  <em>
   The Mandalorian
  </em>
  Season 2 caught a bit of flak for its overreliance on franchise cameos, but it was another hit overall. But then things went downhill quickly with
  <em>
   The Book of Boba Fett
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Obi-Wan Kenobi
  </em>
  received a mixed reception soon after, as did
  <em>
   Ahsoka
  </em>
  , but the universally acclaimed
  <em>
   Andor
  </em>
  was sandwiched in between them. But by far the most divisive
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  show yet is its most recent:
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Acolyte
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Toxic fandom aside,
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  did feature some odd pacing and some poorly written dialogue, but it also featured some strong fight choreography and introduced some intriguing new characters.
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  also left a few lingering questions, and with the confirmation that it's not getting a second season, those lingering questions will be left unanswered. That is unless
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  wants to pick up those threads instead.

  It's been confirmed that

  is set towards the end of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  ' High Republic era, around 100 years before the events of
  <em>
   Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
  </em>
  . At this point in the timeline, the Jedi Order has started to become more of a political force in the galaxy, recruiting far more Padawans than ever before, and blurring the lines between peacekeepers and enforcers.

  <em>

  to crossover with

  Star Wars Eclipse Could Carry Forward The Acolyte's Legacy

 <p>
  While Quantic Dream will probably want to tell its own original story or stories with
  <em>

  , there are still ways it could carry forward the legacy of
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  in the wake of its proxy-cancelation. One obvious way to pick up
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  's torch would be to include characters seen in the show. Jedi Master Vernestra is probably the best pick for a role in
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  , with her playing a very prominent role throughout the High Republic era, as evidenced by her multitude of appearances in various novels, comics, and now
  <em>

  .

  But if
  <em>

  </em>
  wanted to take its torch-bearing to the next level, it could offer some answers to
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  's lingering questions, such as where Qimir and Osha go after the season finale and what Darth Plagueis has to do with it all. If there aren't any direct tie-ins with
  <em>
   The Acolyte
  </em>
  's plot or characters, then
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  could at least pay homage to the show by carrying forward its art style and costume design for its own High Republic environments and characters, which would give the era a sense of cohesion throughout all of its media appearances.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League

  </strong>
  developer Rocksteady is reportedly facing layoffs months after the game's troubled release. The game has struggled to maintain momentum since hitting the market earlier this year, with
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  players critiquing its live-service model, gameplay, and lackluster story. Rocksteady is now facing significant restructuring as a result of the title's poor sales.

  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  is the latest project from game developer Rocksteady, the studio responsible for some of the most popular and critically beloved comic book video games of all time, such as
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham City. Suicide Squad
  </em>
  was a bold departure for the studio and series in general, this time placing players in the shoes of some of DC's most iconic and notorious villains, like Harley Quinn and King Shark. The game is ambitious in scope but suffered negative critical reception and a variety of glitches, as well as backlash regarding
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  's live-service model, with Rocksteady now reportedly facing a substantial number of layoffs.

  Rocksteady staff recently informed Eurogamer that there were "redundancies" at the studio. According to the new report, Rocksteady's QA department has been cut in half over the last month, shrinking from 33 team members to just 15. While many factors may have contributed to this decision,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad'
  </em>
  s poor sales were directly cited as a reason for this "restructuring." The loss of multiple staff members will result in a lower quality product, according to Rocksteady senior management, putting the future of
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  at risk.

  The layoffs include not only junior staff members but also several employees who have been a part of Rocksteady for many years. In August, Warner Bros. reported a whopping 41% fall in revenue from its gaming division due to
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  's weak performance. Previous reports put losses from
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  somewhere in the $200 million range. While there's a lot more in the pipeline for
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  in the coming months, it's unknown if all of Rocksteady's planned content updates will see the light of day following the news of the studio's restructuring.

  Released in January 2024,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad

  struggled immediately after launch, with many criticizing the game's storyline, cast of characters, graphics, and planned roadmap of upcoming content. While the game does feature notes of Rocksteady's talent and skill, notably with its combat system,

  fell flat in many ways, especially when compared to the studio's previous

  Adding to the onslaught of industry layoffs, a number of staff from the development studio behind the 2024 remake of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  have revealed that they are looking for work after being made "redundant." The
  <em>

 <p>
  Starting in 2023, the video game industry has been in a turbulent state of almost constant workforce reductions, budget cuts, and studio shutdowns, leaving thousands without work. Big name companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Embracer Group announced massive layoffs, with both AAA and indie developers caught in the crosshairs. With many still reeling from other recent shutdown news, it would seem
  <em>

  's development team is also facing the chopping block.

  As reported by Eurogamer, Ballistic Moon has seen at least a dozen members of its team abruptly announcing that they are "open to work" after their positions at the studio have been made redundant. While it has not been explicitly stated exactly how many Ballistic Moon staffers have been laid off, many have been shocked to see these unfortunate announcements coming just one month before the big launch of the
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  remake. The original launch of the game was met with massive success, with audiences and critics alike praising the engaging choice mechanics, terrifying atmosphere, impressive graphics, and multiple endings of
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  . Fans have been excitedly awaiting the release of the remake, but spirits have been dampened following the revelation of the Ballistic Moon staff layoffs.

  As has been the case with other unexpected workforce restructurings, audiences have been baffled by staff being let go from a development team so close to a major launch. The recent closure of
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  developer Ouka Studios in the same week as the game's release left many shocked, and fans now worry that the
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  layoffs are continuing this pattern of employees being let go as soon as a game's development is finished. While it is not entirely uncommon for staff to be hired on time-sensitive contracts that inevitably become redundant, the consistency with which these layoffs have occurred across dozens of companies may indicate larger problems plaguing the video game industry as a whole.

  Analysts have continued to debate whether these major workforce shake-ups are absolutely necessary or if other solutions may have better solved the issues faced by companies big and small. Former Nintendo boss Reggie Fils-Aime is optimistic about the future of the gaming industry, though others remain fearful that a recovery may still be too far away. As fans prepare for the release of

  Below is a list of all the lethal and tactical equipment players can select in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6.
  </em>
  This initial selection comes from the
  <strong>
   two beta weekends
  </strong>
  â€” with more expected to arrive when the full version of
  <strong>
   the game launches on October 25
  </strong>
  .

  Lethal Equipment In Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6
 </h3>
 <p>
  Without further ado, here's a closer look at the confirmed pieces of lethal equipment:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":58} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Frag
   </strong>
   - A
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
   staple. A cookable fragmentation grenade that explodes after a short time.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Semtex
   </strong>
   - A timed grenade with the ability to stick to surfaces and other players.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Thermo Grenade
   </strong>
   - A throwable that creates a fuel-air cloud that explodes after a short time.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Blast Trap
   </strong>
   - A device planted by players that detonates when triggered by enemies. Enemies can avoid Blast Traps
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Combat Axe
   </strong>
   - A throwable axe capable of killing enemies with one hit. Bounces off surfaces and retrievable if it misses the target.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":576} -->
 <p>
  Although the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  cycle is in its early stages, there's still plenty of lethal equipment for players to select. The Semtex is great to bring along thanks to its sticky capabilities and huge explosive damage that's capable of eliminating anyone without the Flak Jacket perk in the blink of an eye.

  Tactical Equipment In Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tactical equipment in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is just as useful as its lethal counterparts. Armed with a
  <strong>
   focus on versatility rather than explosive damage
  </strong>
  , players can select plenty of utility to suit how they play. Here's the full list of tacticals on offer:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":242} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Concussion
   </strong>
   - Temporarily slows the movement an aiming of enemies standing close to it when detonated.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Flashbang
   </strong>
   - Temporarily blinds enemies for a short time.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Stim Shot
   </strong>
   - Immediately triggers health regeneration and refreshes Tac Sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Prox Alarm
   </strong>
   - Deploy a pair of sticky alarms that ring and flash when an enemy is in close proximity. When tripped, they show on the minimap.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Decoy
   </strong>
   - A grenade that mimics footsteps and gunfire to confuse the enemy. Also sticks to surfaces.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Concussions and Flashbangs have appeared in nearly every
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  title, but the new addition of a Prox Alarm aims to give players even more ways to enhance their awareness as a match goes on.

  During the beta, the pairing of
  <strong>
   Semtex and Stim Shot
  </strong>
  is the best equipment combo to use in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  multiplayer. The Semtex is great for dealing some additional damage, while the Stim Shot suits an aggressive style of play thanks to the quicker health regeneration.

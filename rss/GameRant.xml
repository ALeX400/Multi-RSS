  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Final Shape campaign is chock-full of exciting and intense encounters, and those battles only grow more challenging for those who enjoy the campaign on Legendary difficulty. With the introduction of the new Dread enemy faction in The Final Shape, players are pitted against foes they have never encountered before — foes who can very masterfully utilize the power of Darkness in the form of Strand and Stasis abilities. While players are required to hold their own throughout each fight in The Final Shape's campaign, the last encounter against the Witness and their army is arguably one of the toughest final bosses of any
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  campaign.

 <p>
  Although the Witness is technically the last boss in the campaign for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion, players won't actually defeat them, as that battle is reserved for the new Salvation's Edge raid. Even so, the encounter is extremely challenging, and that is primarily due to the overwhelming number of mechanics players are required to keep track of throughout the fight. As such, the last encounter for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape campaign ends up being either a multitasking nightmare or a multitasker's dream.

 <h3 id="the-first-phase-of-the-fight-is-tough">
  The First Phase of the Fight Is Tough
 </h3>
 <p>
  Almost every major boss fight in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has unique mechanics for players to learn, but the encounter with The Witness at the end of The Final Shape's main story is on an entirely different level. During the first phase of the fight, players will learn right away that The Witness will regularly move around the arena and unleash a powerful attack that can one-shot them if they are exposed to it. This mechanic continues throughout both phases of the fight, making everything else players need to pay attention to all the more difficult to manage.
 </p>

 <p>
  Shortly after the encounter begins, Dread enemies like Attendants and Grim spawn around the arena, frequently launching ranged attacks that can potentially damage, suppress, and immobilize players. Players can only deal damage to the Stasis-wielding Subjugator that eventually appears, which means that while players are attempting to deal damage to the Subjugator, they also have to evade attacks from The Witness, the Subjugator itself, Attendants, and Grim. After the Subjugator is brought down to half of its health, it becomes invulnerable. Players must then grab a nearby Aegis, use it to destroy the Subjugator's shield, then move to a Light fissure and use the Aegis to defend themselves against a brief whirlwind of darkness.

 <h3 id="the-second-phase-of-the-fight-is-worse">
  The Second Phase of the Fight Is Worse
 </h3>
 <p>
  As if the first phase of the fight against The Witness wasn't hard enough, the second phase is where things get irritatingly difficult. During this phase, Darkness now permanently swirls around the arena and will damage players if they don't get a temporary "Shielded from Darkness" buff from a nearby Darkness seed. In addition to regularly keeping this buff up, players are required to rinse and repeat what they did during the first phase, only things are much more chaotic now.
 </p>

 <p>
  Another Subjugator appears, but this one can use Strand abilities to briefly suspend players. Alongside this Subjugator are Weavers, who can also use Strand to pull players toward them. All of this combined, players are required to deal damage to the Subjugator while maintaining the "Shielded from Darkness" buff at all times, evading attacks from the Witness, avoiding suspension and grabs from Weavers, using the Aegis to destroy the Subjugator's shield when it appears, and then shielding themselves from the Darkness in hopes that their "Shielded from Darkness" buff won't run out once the whirlwind is over.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":984} -->

 <p>
  All of these mechanics certainly make for an exciting last encounter in The Final Shape's campaign, although some will likely find it frustratingly difficult. Even so, rewards await players on the other side that are more than worth the effort.

  Playing a support character is not just about healing. It's about helping one’s team achieve victory by going beyond what they are normally capable of. Mitigating damage through damage reduction and temporary health boosts can help allies withstand a heavy assault and achieve victory over rushing enemies.

 <p>
  Sprocket is a young genius of the Mon Calamari species, whose weapons of choice in the game are modified Blaster Remotes. These are similar to the training drones seen throughout the Star Wars franchise. However, Sprocket’s are capable of dealing far more damage. It is worth noting that Sprocket is not a damage dealer by role, meaning players will be relying more on their abilities to make the most of the character to help out their team. Sprocket is the last Support players can expect to unlock in the game.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1079} -->

 <p>
  Sprocket's passive gives players a speed boost when their health is low enough, making it easier to retreat from dangerous opponents. Players don’t always need to retreat to partner up with other teammates, as they can use Targeting Drones to reveal the location of opposing players. This ability will also make those hit by it take more damage. Sprocket can send out a drone to where ally players are attacking from, which will start to heal his allies. His last active ability allows the deployment of drones that will reduce all damage to Sprocket and his allies. His ultimate places a turret that will relentlessly open fire on the enemy team while they can focus on other tasks.

 <p>
  Players using Sprocket will feel it is best to fight from around a corner, focusing more on their support features. However, since they don't contribute to any of the damage output, Sprocket will lower the odds of the team’s victory. This defensive playstyle can make him a good pick for players who like the survivability, akin to playing a tank.

  Zaina is a Rebel War Hero and can help lead the charge to claim victory. She can be tricky to get the hang of, and this complexity can make it hard to use her effectively. She can use a Bacta Bomb that will instantly heal herself and her allies. Her passive, meanwhile, gives even more healing to anyone who is close to running out of health. While being targeted, she can use a dodge to avoid being hit — which can be done a second time by using an additional charge.

 <p>
  Zaina's Ultimate is Rallying Cry, which has her plant a flag that will give herself and nearby allies a boost to their maximum health. While her kit is small, it is highly effective in practical use. Players those that put the time into mastering Zaina can fight alongside allies to push for victory. Still, Zaina is not for beginners, so players need to be sure they know their stuff.

  A support character that can also contribute damage will be a significant help to achieving victory on any map. Skora is the character for players looking for such a playstyle. She uses a Dart Gun that can put some players off with its slow fire rate, but what it lacks in speed, it makes up for strength. Couple this with her range of support abilities, and Skora makes for an excellent addition to any team. Using Adrenaline Boost will give Skora a burst of speed, and can be performed twice in a row while it has both charges. Players can use this to escape a bad situation while they wait for her passive healing to kick in.

 <p>
  Skora's Stim-shot can quickly patch up the ally that needs healing the most to keep the enemy team from racking up points. It will become even more effective over time, as it is the first upgrade she receives. Skora’s Ultimate is what pushes her to a whole other level above the other Support characters. This skill allows her to throw a projectile that will cause an area of effect attack, healing allies and damaging enemies within it at the same time. This can completely turn the tide of a match, and an entire enemy team can be wiped off the Control Point with a rush-down attack.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  is poised to be the debut of the sixth generation of Capcom’s flagship action RPG series, and it has the opportunity to incorporate new elements inspired by other titles in the publisher’s recent catalog. Following the success of
  <em>
   Dragon’s Dogma 2
  </em>
  earlier this year, it’s possible that the reception to its open-world design could inform the next
  <em>
   MH
  </em>
  ’s own direction. With one playstyle in particular bearing some direct similarities between the two franchises, however,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  might be able to invigorate one of its most unique weapons by looking at what made the Mystic Spearhand Vocation of
  <em>
   DD2
  </em>
  so engaging.

 <p>
  Ever since its introduction in 2013’s
  <em>
   MH4
  </em>
  , the Insect Glaive has remained one of the series’ most original and fully-realized weapon concepts. Not only does it fill the role of a double-sided polearm with extremely high mobility across its moveset, but the titular Kinsect companion associated with the weapon can act as a limited projectile that can buff the player using extracts from monsters. This has created a niche which even a new weapon type in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  would be unlikely to ever share, but the Insect Glaive has also remained relatively unchanged over the years. Now that Capcom has pursued an entirely new dynamic within the same basic style in another game,
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  has more new references for the future than ever before.

  Evoking Monster Hunter’s Insect Glaive

 <p>
  Essentially acting as a replacement for the Vocation known as Mystic Knight in the original
  <em>
   Dragon’s Dogma
  </em>
  , the Mystic Spearhand is a newly-introduced option which shares the emphasis on fast movement that was established with the Insect Glaive. This mixed Vocation’s many spinning maneuvers can allow the player to easily mount large enemies and deliver quick slashes to critical points, but the Mystic Spearhand is defined equally by the access to magick it provides.

  The Mystic Spearhand’s Complementary Suite of Spells

 <p>
  While players are probably going to be dish out most of their damage with melee attacks, the likes of Dragoun’s Stabbe, a piercing air dash, or conjured Seching Blade projectiles, significantly bolster the potential for more complex gameplay. It might take more skill to effectively utilize a defensive spell like the Mystic Spearhand's Mirour Vesture in the midst of fast-paced combat, but these kinds of technical options are fitting for a Vocation that seems intended to reward this sort of intensity and dedication.

  Wilds’ Potential to Elevate the Status of its Kinsects
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   MH World
  </em>
  offered the greatest potential for using damage-centric Kinsect builds to achieve consistent results compared to the Insect Glaive in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  , but this is still a rare way to build a hunter, and requires a relatively deep understanding of the Insect Glaive. While the Insect Glaive should remain based around its fast-hitting strikes for its main source of damage in
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  , incorporating more usage of Kinsect skills in the vein of the Mystic Spearhand’s spells could provide even more synergy. Examples such as Humble Offringe, which levitates objects in the area to hurl at foes, could be repurposed in order to both allow the insect portion of the weapon to have more of an active role apart from extracts, and shine a light on a side of the franchise's non-melee elements.

  The Lands Between is full of dangers that can end the Tarnished’s journey in no time. From epic bosses to regular enemies, you will face all sorts of challenges in your journey. However, not all dangers are obvious. Threats like Status Effects can be pretty devastating and cause significant damage. One such detrimental Status Effect is Scarlet Rot, which is like Poison but even deadlier. While immunity can delay its onset, it doesn't reduce the overall damage. With this in mind, knowing
  <strong>
   how to cure Scarlet Rot in
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  will help keep players alive in this challenging title.

  Scarlet Rot can be caused by enemies, objects, weapons, or even by standing in some places like Lake of Rot. No matter how you get it, you can cure Scarlet Rot in one of two ways; by consuming Preserving Boluses or by casting the Flame, Cleanse Me Incantation

 <p>
  Preserving Boluses are a valuable consumable item that immediately cures Scarlet Rot when used. The easiest way to acquire Preserving Boluses is to buy them from the
  <strong>
   Nomadic Merchant
  </strong>
  at Aeonia Swamp Shore in North Caelid. However, you can only buy three of them, and each Bolus costs 2,500 Runes, so make sure you have enough Runes.

 <p>
  Alternatively, you can craft them using
  <strong>
   the
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Armorer’s Cookbook
  </strong>
  . Players can find the cookbook near the edge of a cliff by the Siofra River Bank Site of Grace. The recipe for crafting Preserving Boluses requires these ingredients:

 <p>
  Dewkissed Herba can be found in Siofra River Bank and its surroundings, whereas Crystal Cave Moss is found in Stillwater Cave and Academy Crystal Cave. Players can also get their hands on a Sacramental Bud in Writheblood Ruins and Church of the Plague.

  After four years of waiting, there is still no official news of a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  sequel. Apart from the odd rumor here and there,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's successor still hangs in the balance, as does the continuation of the first game's story.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  sees players exploring a breathtaking open-world feudal Japan in the shoes of Jin Sakai, a Samurai who eventually foregoes tradition to do what is necessary to save Tsushima and those he loves from the heartless Mongols. At the end of the game, players are faced with a tough choice — one that ultimately defines Jin's path, although the game's epilogue remains mostly the same.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  doesn't give players any meaningful choices leading up to its conclusion. There are plenty of different dialogue decisions to be made throughout the story, but nothing that impacts the narrative like the choice made at the end. Once players reach the final confrontation with Lord Shimura, they are given two choices: take the honorable path by killing him or the dishonorable path by sparing him. Unfortunately, since there is no buildup to this moment, and it doesn't change anything but a bit of dialogue in the end, making the choice can feel very unfulfilling from a narrative standpoint. This is something
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  could improve upon to give players an even more dynamic story experience.

  Ghost of Tsushima 2 Should Build Up Its Endings More With Branching Choices During the Story
 </h3>
 <p>
  One reason
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's multiple endings ultimately fall flat is that there are no major choices offered prior to that moment.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  could improve the first game's approach to multiple endings by giving players branching choices throughout the story that could lead them to one ending or another. This way, each ending would hold much more weight and mean more to players as they navigate the main story.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  was split into three acts, a sequel could follow the same pattern. However, this time, perhaps transitioning to the next act would require players to make a significant choice that would come into play once the overarching narrative reaches its grand finale. These moments would be great indicators that players should heavily weigh their options before making a decision, as they would understand the story's ending depends on it.

  Ghost of Tsushima 2 Can Afford to Make Its Endings Mean More for Its Epilogue
 </h3>
 <p>
  Regardless of the choice players make at the end of
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , it's essentially all the same. If Shimura is killed, Jin is on the run; if Shimura survives, he is brushed off with a simple comment that he will not come after Jin, but Jin is still on the run. As such, perhaps
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  could make its epilogue an endgame of sorts that hinges on the ending players choose.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  approached its endings in this way, allowing players to either end the game immediately or head to its Unmoored World endgame area to continue the story. Something like this would make

  's final choices mean more for the story's conclusion while simultaneously increasing the game's replay value.

 <p>
  There are plenty of other choice-driven games out there that
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  could draw inspiration from when it comes to developing its multiple endings, but as long as it starts thinking about the end of the story before it actually gets there, and as long as its ending means something for the epilogue, it should be in good shape.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  has a chance to do something its predecessor fell short in, so it would do well to examine where things can be improved.

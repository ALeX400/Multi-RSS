  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is arguably the premier gaming service available on the market today, and though it largely caters to an adult audience, there are quite a few titles available in its vast library that are appealing to a younger audience. In fact, there's a pretty vast selection of titles that kids of all ages are sure to find hours of enjoyment in.

   best
  </strong>
  <strong>
   children's games on Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  cover a wide spectrum of genres and gameplay styles. There should be something for just about everyone. Quite a few of the following titles feature cooperative play in one capacity or another, allowing parents and siblings to dive into the fun too.

   In this month so far, Microsoft has added a pretty great fighter to its subscription service, and this one is even good for children! Consequently, this title has been added right at the top of this

  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  is such a pillar of the casual fighting industry that any similar project is immediately fighting an uphill battle to justify its existence, let alone challenge Nintendo's behemoth. Despite the crossover franchise being exclusive to another ecosystem, leaving room for companies to cater to Xbox users without having to directly compete against
  <em>
   SSB
  </em>
  , platform fighter games have generally struggled to take full advantage of that vacancy.

  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  was not, frankly, one of the strongest entries in this peculiar subgenre, with the 2021 release lacking polish, replayvalue, or pageantry. It seemed destined to be forgotten. However, the unthinkable happened – Fairy Play released a sequel. And, even more unexpectedly,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  improved considerably on its predecessor. While not fundamentally playing that differently from the first entry, the sequel balanced its character roster while adding flourishes that are not only fun to pull off in the middle of battles but also pay tribute to the source material. Along with multiplayer modes,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  is also a viable single-player option thanks to a campaign with a silly but enjoyable story. While quite short and repetitive, the mode is perfect for something like Game Pass.

 <p>
  Naturally, this
  <strong>
   kids' game
  </strong>
  is mostly for Nickelodeon fans who will get a thrill from just trying out the characters on the roster. However, if a child just wants to play an accessible fighter with a few friends,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  should get the job done.

  An exciting local or online co-op option on Game Pass,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is perfect for parents to play with their kids. On paper, nothing sounds more mundane than moving furniture, but, similar to something like
  <em>
   Overcooked!
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  transforms this tiring and frustrating part of life into a silly physics-based party game with an over-the-top presentation and story. This time around, movers will need to transfer houses' worth of items across parallel realities, a concept that presents plenty of interesting scenarios and visuals.

  Although great for all ages,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  can be somewhat difficult. After all, this is effectively a puzzle game that challenges player(s) to decipher the best and most efficient route to carry each piece of furniture, all the while trying to work together rather than against each other.

  <em>
   Little Kitty, Big City
  </em>
  has a simple premise that is perfect for this type of game. Used to living the good life in a high-up apartment building, a black cat's world comes crashing down after they fall out of a window; now, they must eat fish, make a few friends, get petted by humans, and (hopefully) find their way back home. As they travel across the streets around their owner's apartment, the feline gets to solve a few puzzles while also taking on the occasional side quest to keep things interesting.

  Relaxing and charming,
  <em>
   Little Kitty, Big City
  </em>
  offers the ideal escape from reality for people of all ages. While not particularly deep mechanically or thematically, the game is relentlessly cute and warm.

  Even though they tend to have content suitable for all ages, restaurant sims focus so much on micromanagement that they can be overwhelming for young players. While not a complete exception,
  <em>
   Rolling Hills

  is a bit more streamlined than most of the genre's entries, making it a better option for kids taking their first steps into this universe.

  Furthermore, the cute visuals and wholesome setting combine to create a pretty relaxing and welcoming experience, one that offers some depth and challenge but does not go out of its way to punish players. If nothing else, children will likely enjoy the protagonist, a Sushi Bot with an adorable design and an affable personality.

  Many games try to represent childlike wonder, but few titles capture the feeling as perfectly as
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  . The story is simple: a brother wants his older sister to play with him like they used to when they were younger. Consequently, he sets out to plan a game so amazing that she will have no choice but to hang out. The protagonist's drive might be relatable to a lot of kids who have watched their siblings mature before their eyes or who simply just enjoy creating make-believe scenarios.
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  has a certain nostalgic air that might hit the mark with older players; however, it is perfect for children.

  Moving past the premise, this game plays out like a fairly typical adventure, with light platforming, puzzles, and exploration.

  Halloween is a big night for kids, but there are not all that many spooky games that target younger players. While far removed from horror,
  <em>
   Costume Quest
  </em>
  otherwise fully embraces the aesthetic and magic of the holiday. Set on Halloween night, children will go on an adventure to rescue their kidnapped sibling, a journey that involves collecting costumes to use in turn-based battles.

  Who does not enjoy traveling through a picturesque park?
  <em>
   A Short Hike
  </em>
  follows Claire, a bird who has a lot on her mind, to the point that she finds it difficult to leave her worries aside and just enjoy the Hawk Peak Provincial Park's natural beauty. As she is awaiting an important call, Claire decides to head to the park's summit to find a signal, but it is up to the player to decide whether this journey should come with a few tangents.

  <em>
   Minecraft

  straddles a fine line between child-friendliness and complexity that makes it a practical must when it comes to kids’ game libraries. Its Creative Mode might seem like the obvious draw as it allows players to explore the breadth of their imagination and build without limitation.

  <em>
   Plants vs. Zombies
  </em>
  had a fairly active 2010s, but the franchise has yet to make an appearance in the current decade. While waiting for
  <em>
   Plants vs. Zombies 3
  </em>
  to become a reality, players (and children) can jump into the previous titles, most of which are on Xbox Game Pass. While
  <em>
   Battle for Neighborville
  </em>
  is the most recent project,
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  is generally regarded as the license's high point. Unlike the strategy-driven main titles, the
  <em>
   Garden Warfare
  </em>
  games are third-person shooters; that said, they still center around defending locations.

 <p>
  Released in 2016,
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  was a visual treat at the time thanks to its animated character designs and colorful backdrops. Even all these years later, the game is still pleasing to the eyes. While not overly deep or complicated, the combat system is also pretty good and satisfying.
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  is built upon classes, with both Plants and Zombies having a small but versatile selection at their disposal. While prioritizing multiplayer, the title does allow most modes to be played solo, replacing other players with AI. There is even something resembling a story mode, although it is not especially great.

   TMNT: Shredder's Revenge

  is a throwback to classic beat 'em up arcade games from the '90s, and it does an impeccable job of modernizing this genre. Offering seven playable characters, each of which is uniquely defined,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge

  stories and games.

  While certainly one of the better

  <em>
   Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  is a middling platformer that garnered extra scrutiny since it launched alongside the Xbox One X.
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  takes 2017's release and greatly enhances it, crafting an experience that is superior in nearly every way. Along with packaging the levels from the DLC into the campaign,
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  adds camera control, fixing one of the biggest issues in the original version.

  is a fresh option that should not be overlooked. The game will likely impress both young children and older players who are fans of platformers.

  <em>
   My Friend Peppa Pig

  is for very young children who happen to watch the show. If someone does not meet those two criteria, they are unlikely to find anything here that will keep them mildly entertained. That said, for what it is, this brief adventure game is pretty good. Kids get to create their own character who goes on to befriend Peppa Pig, essentially allowing them to step into the show's world.

  Visually,
  <em>
   My Friend Peppa Pig
  </em>
  does a fantastic job of replicating the aesthetic of the source material. Even though the art style is relatively simple, it still looks good. The gameplay consists of exploring famous locations from the series and interacting with the license's characters, perhaps completing a few puzzles along the way. On paper, this is nothing special, but the execution is quite great.

  Microsoft is not known for its mascot platformers, but the company did try to create its own equivalent of Sonic or Mario during the Xbox's formative years.
  <em>
   Blinx: The Time Sweeper

  came out to a mixed reception, garnering praise for its visuals and some of its ideas along with criticism for its repetitive nature and convoluted mechanics.

  The basement tool can help you create your underground house; in the menu, it is located right next to the Build Room tool. To add a basement, select this tool and draw your basement in the shape you prefer. Once this has been done, your Sims will need a way to access the basement, so you’ll need to
  <strong>
   add stairs
  </strong>
  using the Stairs option.

  While planning your underground house, don’t forget to make an outdoor space for a spectacular entrance. In the outdoor area, you can place a swimming pool to create a relaxing place for your Sims. You can also add doors, pillars, and most importantly,
  <strong>
   windows to let natural light in
  </strong>
  . Furthermore, Simmers can also plant grass and flowers and use tiles or other decorative items to make the place look nice.

  The best part about building an underground house in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  is getting to decorate it. Inside, you can put up wallpapers and furnish each room with related items like sofas, beds, chairs, tables, etc., just like you would with any other ground level room. Underground houses in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  can become incredibly homely, and with the right additions and adjustments, players will soon forget they ever had a home above ground.

  One of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Minecraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  biggest strengths is its sprawling kaleidoscope of biomes, presenting a biodiversity that's practically unrivaled in the realm of procedurally-generated sandboxes. However, there are some that fans prefer over others—and some that stand head and shoulders above
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's other biomes.

  Biomes can't be as easily ranked as elements like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's enchantments, which house many options that are objectively better than others. Rather, this tier list will rank biomes on what resources they offer, the challenges they pose, and the general fun of living and dwelling there. Aesthetics will also play a lot into that latter part, meaning that there will inevitably be a great deal of subjectivity. However, these landscapes can still broadly be categorized.

  Sometimes, simple is better—and that's definitely the case for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's best biomes. This relaxing selection is great for those just starting out, with the plains being especially great for this thanks to the villages that spawn within them. Forests and flower forests are both pretty and great sources of wood and food, while swamps make this spot thanks to the extra content found within them. Not only do witch huts add to their already excellent ambiance, but they provide a far more reliable source of slime compared to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's rarer slime chunks.

  The offerings in A-Tier aren't far behind S in many cases, with every biome listed above bringing fun and valuables to the table. Snowy plains can be irritating with snow piles and strays, but their lack of zombie spawns make them great for those invested in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's villagers. Peaks and windswept biomes offer specialized ore generation and great views, while taiga biomes serve as a whimsical alternative to other forests. Frozen rivers can be used as high-speed boat circuits, the deep dark and end islands offer excellent loot and unique gameplay, and the Nether's forests offer some unique ecosystems.

  B-Tier biomes are either held back in a minor way, or just nice-looking areas with little substance beyond aesthetics. The latter is the case for the ice spikes, cherry grove, and badlands (though that last one is a solid find for gold hunters).

  's mushroom fields aren't as valuable as they once were, with their infinite food source not being as useful in modern times, but finding one is still a huge reward in-and-of itself. Mangrove swamps have most of the benefits of regular swamps, but their trees can be a tad frustrating to harvest.

 <p>
  These three biomes range from unexceptional to overly punishing, with beaches and dripstone caves being indicative of the former; luckily, both biomes are pleasing sights even if they lack strong mechanics. Soul sand valleys also have a great vibe, sporting wastelands of leviathan carcasses, but its mix of ghasts, skeletons, and soul sand make it one of the less desirable Nether biomes.

  The basalt delta is perhaps the only bad biome in the game, and even then it has upsides with great sound design and a steady supply of blackstone. Regardless, it is not only filled with magma cubes (which are almost as deadly as ghasts), but it is designed to their strengths with frequent pillars and pockets of lava and magma. Moreover, it's the only Nether biome that doesn't spawn the Nether's bastions.

  There is a Stash just southeast of Dire Thicket in
  <strong>
   <em>
    STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Lesser Zone, and it may appear on a player's map as a Forgotten Stash, Tidy Stash, Stalker's Hidden Stuff, etc. Regardless of the Stash's name, the method that is used to access it is the same. This guide is here to describe that method, and it will help players collect the loot from the Dire Thicket Stash in
  <em>
   STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  .

  STALKER 2: How to Get Dire Thicket Stash
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Dire Thicket Stash is in an
  <strong>
   underground area
  </strong>
  , and there are two ways to access it. The first is simply to fall into the hole that is directly above the Stash's position, though players who pursue this option should make sure to have a
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  medkit handy, as they will take significant fall damage. The second option is to safely descend a
  <strong>
   ladder slightly to the east of the Stash
  </strong>
  , and the following images should help players find that object.

  <strong>
   swarm of rats
  </strong>

 <p>
  Indeed, the rat swarm can quickly take Skif down if it is left unaddressed, and players are advised to
  <strong>
   sprint to the ladder on the east side
  </strong>
  of the underground area, and climb it, as soon as the creatures appear. If the player was able to loot all the objects, including the Dire Thicket Stash, before performing that maneuver, they can simply leave the area and continue exploring the Zone in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  . However, if there are still objects to collect, players should wait for the rats to swarm the bottom of the ladder and then throw a
  <strong>
   grenade
  </strong>
  down at them.

 <p>
  That single grenade should be enough to clear the entirety of the rat swarm, allowing players to climb back down the ladder and loot anything that they missed. The rats are not gone permanently, though, and
  <em>
   STALKER
  </em>
  fans should be prepared to climb out of the underground area if they spawn again. Fortunately, players who were unable to loot the remaining items during their second time in the area can just use a grenade to clear the swarm once again.

  ’s player count has decreased by over 60% since the game’s all-time peak earlier this week. Due to a rocky launch,

  Since the launch of the franchise’s first game in the 80s,
  <em>

  Despite how widely anticipated its release was,

  had a rocky launch, and it’s currently losing players quickly on Steam. The title achieved an all-time peak player count of 24,863 gamers on the popular PC platform soon after its launch, but numbers have been steadily decreasing, as
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  lost over 60% of its player base since then. While the Steam player count of
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  is slightly on the uptick in the last few hours, it’s still far from even the 13,282 player 24-hour peak, with only 9,375 gamers playing on Steam at the time of this report.

  The main reason why this title is struggling is related to game-breaking launch problems, which included multiple gamers having to wait over 30 minutes to play due to server issues, and sometimes even being stuck at 97% on the loading screen. Some gamers also reported that the flight sim used too much GPU and that one aircraft was missing from their library. These game-breaking issues led
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  to get “Overwhelmingly Negative” reviews on Steam. While developer Asobo Studio addressed the issues recently, explaining that the team is working on solving the server problems, this does not seem enough to hold the player count, which is steadily decreasing.

  was also released for Xbox Game Pass and was one of Microsoft’s most important highlights for November. So, it’s disappointing to see such a bad launch. Hopefully, these issues will be fixed soon, and gamers will come back, as the title seems to be in a good state apart from these problems, which are mostly related to servers not handling a huge player demand.

 <p>
  All in all, then, farming monsters in
  <em>
   Supervive
  </em>
  is of great importance, and while it might seem easy, many beginners in
  <em>
   Supervive
  </em>
  are likely missing a huge trick to save time and gain an advantage over other teams. It's also important to know that
  <strong>
   allies can gain XP from the Monsters their allies last hit
  </strong>
  , but only if they are in range.

  When approaching a Creep Camp in

  <strong>
   best to kill the small Monsters first

 <ul>
  <li>
   Small Monsters
   <strong>
    give XP on death
   </strong>
   , potentially allowing players to
   <strong>
    level up before facing the larger one
   </strong>
   . This is particularly true for reaching Level 2.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Some small Monsters are healers
   </strong>
   . Leaving these alive while attempting to kill the big one is fruitless.
   <strong>
    Kill healers first!
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   These small Monsters
   <strong>
    can receive shields multiple times

   <strong>
    damage doesn't get wasted

  The larger Monster in a camp is much stronger, both in terms of

  that many beginners aren't aware of in this Battle Royale game.

  When these units are channeling their signature ability, a

  By
  <strong>
   using an ability on them during this time

  <strong>
   large chunk of damage

  . In addition to this,
  <strong>
   the ability used will have its cooldown refunded

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players have to walk or run to travel between different locations, as there aren't any vehicles in the game. Actions like running, jumping, and melee attacks all cost stamina. Running out of stamina encumbers Skiff's movement and his ability to defend himself with melee. However, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you increase stamina usage and regain it quickly in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Weight is one of the major survival mechanics in
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  , as it directly impacts a player's endurance stats (stamina).
  <strong>
   Skiff can carry up to 80kg of weight
  </strong>
  , but don't rely on that figure, as carrying that much inventory will disable his movement entirely.
 </p>

 <p>
  To keep stamina consumption and regeneration optimal,
  <strong>
   it's recommended that players keep their weight under 50 KG
  </strong>
  (Green Zone). This will optimize your stamina consumption, allowing you to run for longer. On top of consumption, it'll also allow you to regenerate your stamina more quickly compared to when you're in the Yellow or Red zone.

  Even if players have their weight in check, they're still going to run out of stamina eventually. In that case,
  <strong>
   you can consume water and energy drinks to regain stamina
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  . Although water restores stamina by a moderate amount, energy drink restores stamina greatly while also improving regeneration speed for a short duration.

 <p>
  Artifacts are one of the items that players can find hidden around the world of
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  . Some of them directly impact the endurance stats of the player, ultimately increasing stamina. One of those artifacts is called the "
  <strong>
   Battery
  </strong>
  ," which players can look for around
  <strong>
   electrical anomaly fields
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  After equipping the item, players will have a slight effect on endurance, with a minor radiation trade-off, increasing your overall stamina in
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  .

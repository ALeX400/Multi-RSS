  Evolving Eevee in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  can be a tricky affair, depending on which evolution players want. Sometimes, players require it for Special Research tasks, such as the one involving Celebi. There are a couple of objectives that revolve around Eevee, with one asking players to evolve Eevee into Espeon, and another asking them to evolve Eevee into Umbreon.

  Like other Eevee evolutions, there is a name trick that's commonly used in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  to control Eevee's evolution. For Umbreon, players need to give Eevee the nickname Tamao and evolve it. However, the name trick only works for the first time, so some players may be wondering about another method they can use to evolve Eevee into Umbreon.

  To evolve Eevee into Umbreon without using the name trick, players first need to make Eevee their buddy Pokemon. After that, players need to
  <strong>
   walk a total of 10km
  </strong>
  with Eevee as their buddy, and then wait for it to be nighttime.
  <strong>
   Make sure that it's nighttime
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , as the night sky in the game world is dark, and then evolve the Eevee that's assigned as your buddy Pokemon. If all the requirements are met, then that Eevee should evolve into Umbreon.

 <p>
  Players won't run into the step to evolve Eevee into Umbreon until they've completed the first four steps to the
  <strong>
   Celebi Special Research
  </strong>
  quest. Prior to that, they will have to evolve Eevee into Espeon, and as one might imagine, the same exact method will work, except instead of evolving Eevee at night, players need to do it during the day.

 <p>
  Another objective for this step in the Celebi Special Research quest actually asks players to walk with Eevee as their buddy for 10km anyway, so players can complete two objectives at once. Then, all they'll need to do to complete the step is trade a Pokemon, which should be as easy as finding a friend nearby willing to trade.

 <p>
  Now that players know that they can evolve Eevee into Umbreon without using the name trick, what they need to do in order to complete the Celebi Special Research should be more apparent.

  Along with additional dragon field bosses, players will want to take advantage of anything that has the anti-dragon effect, which simply deals more damage to dragon enemies. One consumable is the Dragon Communion Harpoon, which can be thrown a great distance to deal large amounts of damage to dragons; here's how to craft and use these harpoons.

  Dragon Communion Harpoons can be
  <strong>
   crafted after players get Igon's Cookbook [1]
  </strong>
  . To get this cookbook, players will first need to find and traverse the Dragon Pit, which can be reached almost right away in the DLC. After exiting the Dragon Pit and approaching the base of the Jagged Peak, continue until you find the large open area with the first dragon field boss within.

  Take the southern path and continue forward as you approach the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion, which is a key location to transform into a dragon in
  <em>

  . Before reaching the altar,
  <strong>
   look along the right side of the path to find a destroyed watchtower
  </strong>
  that can be easily entered, with the cookbook being found on the dead body within. Once you have the cookbook, Dragon Communion Harpoons can be crafted using:

 <p>
  This is a unique consumable in that it can be charged to increase the damage. It has an
  <strong>
   anti-dragon effect which further increases its damage to dragons
  </strong>
  . Overall, these consumables are very useful with strength builds, and should be considered as a useful ranged option when fighting Bayle The Dread at the top of the Jagged Peak. The only downside to these Harpoons is that only one is crafted at a time, and Sharp Gravel Stones take a bit of effort to find, so be sure to save these harpoons for major dragon bosses.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak reveals that Bulbasaur will be the first monster to get its Dynamax form.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has been introducing many features and new Pokemon since its launch, enhancing the player experience. Despite this, there are two features that
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers still miss.

 <p>
  These features are the Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon, introduced with the release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  . Dynamax is a temporary transformation that significantly increases the Pokemon's size and strength, allowing them to use the abilities known as Max Moves. Gigantamax, meanwhile, is a special type of Dynamax that also changes the Pokemon's appearance, allowing it to use G-Max Moves. Fans have eagerly waited for the addition of Dynamax and Gigantamax critters to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , and a new leak provides more information about them.

 <p>
  Leakers from The Pokemod Group have revealed that Bulbasaur will be the first Pokemon to get the Dynamax treatment in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . According to the leak, the Pokemon starter from Kanto was the first to receive the configuration for “Bread,” the codename for Dynamax. The leak also explains that the configuration is related to another called “BreadTierGroups,” in which Dynamax Bulbasaur is classified as “GROUP_1.” Although the leak doesn't provide further details,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO players
  </em>
  in the comments section speculate that this is a similar classification to raids, which are divided into 1, 3, and 5 stars.

 <p>
  While some
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players were surprised that Pikachu wasn't the first critter to get its Dynamax form, others commented that “it makes sense,” Bulbasaur is the first Pokemon in the Regional Pokedex. This new leak complements the information released by Pokemoders last month when leakers discovered evidence that Dynamax and Gigantamax forms are on their way to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Additionally, a teaser released by
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  earlier this month showed Dynamaxing Wartortle in the background, teasing the addition of the feature.

 <p>
  Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon still don't have a date to arrive in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , and because it's a leak, details may change until an official announcement from Niantic. Despite this,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can already interact with some gimmicks from the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise. One of these gimmicks is Shadow Pokemon, monsters left behind when
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players defeat Team GO Rocket. Another example is Mega Evolutions, which changes the appearance of critters in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  just like in the mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games. While in the mainline games, trainers need Mega Stones to evolve their Pokemon, to mega evolve a critter in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , players need to have Mega Energy specific to that Pokemon.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has come up with a simple but effective idea for improving the usefulness of the Prismatic Titan. The Prismatic subclass was added to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  when The Final Shape expansion was released in June 2024, with the new subclass allowing players to mix light and dark abilities to become a more powerful Guardian as they took on The Witness.

 <p>
  The new subclass is currently limited to the Guardians themselves, but with Bungie constantly tweaking and making changes to the game, fans could soon see Prismatic weapons introduced to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . One player, however, has suggested a simple way to improve the Titan class to give it a much-needed shot in the arm, especially when compared to its counterparts.

 <p>
  A Redditor that goes by the username randomnumbers22 suggests that Bungie should have allowed Prismatic Titans to utilize the hammer throw melee from the Solar subclass. The post suggests that pairing it with the Arc-type exotic Point-Contact Cannon Brace could give the special an added jolt of power thanks to its Hammer of the Gods perk, which surrounds the battlefield in lightning when the thunderclap melee is triggered.

 <p>
  Fans seem largely receptive to the idea of combining Solar and Arc classes into one melee attack. In the post, which currently has 1.2k upvotes in the r/Destiny subreddit, one of the replies to the comments builds on this line of thought by suggesting a skill could be implemented that recalled the hammer once it had been thrown, much like Thor wielding the hammer Mjolnir.

 <p>
  While the developers have gone on the record to assure players that the Prismatic Titans will see some form of adjustments, Bungie is nerfing the Hunter class of Guardians in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  to ensure the PVP modes have a level playing field. The changes see the effectiveness of the Threaded Specter’s aim assist down by 50%, with detonation damage to opposing players in the PVP arenas down by 45%.

 <p>
  While it’s hard to say if randomnumbers22’s idea will be implemented down the line, Bungie is listening to fans when it comes to implementing changes to its popular first-person shooter. This is evidenced by the recent release of The Final Shape’s second episode of post-expansion content as the developer released the entire story of Revenant in one go. This allows players to tackle the story at their own pace rather than drip-feeding the content every week.

  </strong>
  <em>
   : Just recently, Capcom hit a new milestone with the Resident Evil series, with the franchise's sales reaching 160 million copies. These numbers indicate Resident Evil's undying potential to satisfy its fanbase with new installments. Considering the series' ever-growing popularity, this list has been updated to include one underrated installment that significantly boosted sales despite the controversies surrounding its launch: Resident Evil 6. While not renowned for its fright factor, RE6 warrants inclusion notably for its unconventional enemy design. This update incorporates a chilling moment from Resident Evil 6, involving one of the most formidable enemies in the entire franchise.

  There are multiple encounters with Ustanak in

Following the chilling chase, Jake must finally confront Ustanak, which feels like fighting both Nemesis and Mr. X at the same time—Ustanak just won’t go down no matter what.

  According to
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  ’s lore, Ustanak was the subject of experimental tests on the C Virus, which resulted in his transformation. What makes this monster scarier is his high intelligence. Unlike most other gigantic
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  creatures, Ustanak can make his own weapons and make dreadful decisions when facing his targets.

 <p>
  To be fair to other entries on the list,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  does not create many scary moments. The enemy designs are rather stereotypical, seemingly aimed at attracting more FPS fans who may not have enjoyed previous games. However, the outcome fell short of satisfying hardcore fans of the genre and was not as financially successful as expected.

  Capcom's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  struggled to live up to the extremely high expectations that were placed on its shoulders long before the game was even announced.
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5

  is certainly not a bad game though, exemplified by its impressive Metascore of 86 on PC.

  Imagine it’s 1996, and a teenage gamer is about to fire up a game on their PS1 that everyone’s buzzing about:
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  . The initial cinematics are spine-chilling enough to tempt them to eject the disc and retreat to
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  . Nonetheless, they muster the courage to dive in. Following a few hours of gripping gameplay that’s left their eyes widened and palms sweaty, they’re confronted with their ultimate dread: Fighting a colossal spider in a claustrophobic underground tunnel. That’s true fear.

  The pixelated visuals of the first
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  game might not look scary now. But back when the survival horror genre was in its baby stage, those “funny-looking” zombies could easily give someone a heart attack—especially if they had no idea what jumpscare is. The arachnophobia-inducing Black Tiger boss battle in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 1996
  </em>
  is destined to stand as an iconic “hair-raising” moment in video game history. Its impact goes beyond the inherent creepiness of giant spiders; it inspired numerous horror games to exploit gamers’ phobias in the most sadistic ways imaginable.

  <em>

  Along with new characters, there are a host of new enemies, including the terrifying revenants, and grotesque monstrosities of sewn-together body parts that are infected with the Uroboros virus. During the exploration of the mansion, one sneaky revenant falls down from the ceiling right at the player's feet, resulting in a cheap but effective jumpscare.

  Through her explorations of the city, Jill experiences many terrifying events, such as running away from Nemesis, mutated dogs, or the dreaded drain deimos. Said to be infected with fleas, these insects, unfortunately, are not flea-sized and are large enough to present a threat. The most horrifying thing about these creatures is that they can grapple Jill and infect her with parasites that are a death sentence unless she can cleanse herself of them.

   <em>
    Resident Evil: Code Veronica
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first main series of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games to be released after the original trilogy. The game was notable for its visuals, which were a significant improvement from the game's predecessors.

 <p>
  The visuals were considered to be movie-like at the time of the game's release. This made the game all the more frightening, as audiences hadn't seen such realistic horror visuals in a video game before.

   <strong>
    Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles
   </strong>
  </em>
  was the first game in the franchise to be released after the iconic
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4.
  </em>
  This put a ton of pressure on the on-rails shooter, and sadly, it failed to live up to the hype, scoring a lackluster 75 on Metacritic.

 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5,
  </em>
  the amount of hype around
  <em>
   Umbrella Chronicles
  </em>
  was more of a curse than a gift. The initial disappointment clouded what was a solid on-rails shooter that made excellent use of the Nintendo Wii's motion controls. The on-rail mechanic is what grants
  <em>
   Umbrella Chronicles
  </em>
  a spot on this list, as players have no choice but to follow their characters who are constantly heading directly into danger.

  The
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  series' fifth main installment was released in 2002. The game didn't perform badly with critics, though it was seen as a drop in form from the incredible run of games that Capcom was on leading up to its release. Criticisms were predominantly directed at the game's lack of innovation, particularly in terms of its fixed camera, which seemed outdated at the time.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 0

  </strong>
  earns a spot on this list for its atmosphere. The improved hardware of the GameCube allowed Capcom's developers to create more meticulously detailed environments than ever before, which greatly helped the game's unsettling elements pop.

  The Nintendo 3DS doesn't seem like the most natural place for an action-horror title, but Capcom was able to make it work with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil: Revelations

   .
  </em>
  The game performed particularly well with critics, exemplified by its impressive 82 Metascore.

  As mentioned previously, Capcom made the bold decision of reinventing its iconic
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise with the sixth main series iteration. The risk certainly paid off, as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  breathed new life into the series, and it quickly became recognized as one of the best games of all time.

 <p>
  The game sacrificed some of the series' iconic horror in favor of more action-packed gameplay, though there are still a few frightening moments. Such moments include the fight against Del Lago, the first encounter with a Regenerador, and the fight against Verdugo.

  marks a significant increase in the fear factor of this list's entries. Whereas most of the games weren't too scary but did have scary moments,
  <em>
   Resident Evil

  (2002) is a genuinely unsettling experience throughout.

  The idea of searching a zombie-infested Police Station in Raccoon City as the young and clumsy Leon should be enough to scare most gamers away. But if they overcome the initial fear and give
  <em>
   RE2 Remake
  </em>
  a shot, they’ll be rewarding themselves with countless terrifying moments that will send shivers down their spines. One such instance is
  <strong>
   the first encounter with a Licker
  </strong>
  , an unsettling hybrid creature capable of decapitating anyone with its elongated tongue.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":12,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":12,"nbrPlacementsScanned":12,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1050} -->

 <p>
  What intensifies this scene is the Lickers’ lack of sight. These creatures rely on sound to detect their prey, as they are devoid of eyes. Consequently, players will find themselves attempting to
  <strong>
   stealthily maneuver past them while they emit ominous growls
  </strong>
  and wait for their mistakes.

 <p>
  When Leon first hears a Licker’s growl for the first time, he goes, “What in God’s name…?” And that should be a sign for players to never return to that hallway again.

  The success of the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake unsurprisingly led to a remake of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  just one year later. However, the game would have benefited from a longer development cycle, as it struggled to emulate the success of its predecessor.

 <p>
  Disappointment over the remake shouldn't detract from the original game, however, as the 1999 title is not only one of the franchise's best entries, but it's also one of the scariest over 20 years after its initial release, largely thanks to the infamous Nemesis.

  With the overwhelming success of the remakes of

  When it was revealed that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil Village
   </strong>

  would implement similar gameplay mechanics and themes to its predecessor, many people started preparing for another horrifying experience. And that is just what they got as they saddled up for another adventure as the series' latest new protagonist, Ethan Winters, as he searched for his kidnapped daughter Rosemary in an isolated Romanian village.

  With each of the Four Lords being defined by a different subgenre of horror, players are spoiled for choice about which part of the game is the scariest, depending on what they personally find frightening, but most fans seem to be in agreement about one infamous part of the game that sparked nearly as much discussion as the much beloved Lady Dimitrescu: House Beneviento.

 <p>
  In terms of the numbered titles, it seems that Capcom is separating their
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games into groups of three
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  The first three games centered around combat, survival, and puzzle-solving with a fixed perspective.
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  then leaned into the series' action elements and put the camera over the protagonist's shoulder.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
   </strong>
  </em>
  again implemented a perspective change while also ramping up the level of horror, inspired by titles like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Outlast
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Amnesia
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

  Ethan Winters travels to an old farmhouse in Louisiana in search of his missing wife, Mia, after receiving a message from her, despite her being AWOL for three years. He finds much more than he bargained for when he encounters her captors, the homicidal Baker family, and discovers dark secrets beneath the bogwater.

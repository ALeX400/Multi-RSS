      <title>How Marvel Snap's Developers Developed High Voltage As A Three-Turn Game</title>

  Marvel Comics-themed card game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Snap
   </strong>
  </em>
  is introducing a new limited-time mode in the form of High Voltage, which the developers revealed was designed to feel as different as possible from a normal game. Instead of having six turns to compete,
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  players will have only three turns to claim the victory. Other changes include the removal of the Snap mechanic, the introduction of an energy range, and the ability to draw two cards per turn. Creating High Voltage mode required a great deal of experimentation, and the mode went through a number of changes before its release.

  Game Rant spoke to
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  design director Ben Hayes about the process of moving from a six-turn game to a three-turn game. Hayes also spoke about why the decision was made to implement a range in which players will receive between two and five energy per turn. Ultimately, Hayes and the team feel that the resulting mode feels quite different from standard
  <em>
   Snap
  </em>
  , and will encourage players to experiment with powerful, high-risk cards or unique combinations that they might not otherwise try.

  Initially, Hayes revealed, the team intended for High Voltage mode to feature four turns per game. However, after testing a four-turn match, Hayes realized that "four still felt more like normal
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  than we were going for." After the decrease to three turns, High Voltage, even more than previous limited-time mode Deadpool's Diner, began feeling like the truly unique game mode the team had hoped to create.

 <p>
  In High Voltage, Hayes explains, players are encouraged to experiment because they only have such a tight turn limit to work with - thus, they are encouraged to try out powerful combos immediately without much opportunity for setup. Describing his own deck-building strategy while playtesting the new mode, Hayes said that "instead of needing to build that out really progressively or sequentially with a curve of energy, or needing to have support cards and finesse the deck building, [he takes] the most powerful parts of that strategy and chuck[s] it in the deck." When asked to name specific cards he enjoys using in High Voltage, the design director cited Black Panther, which has a high Energy cost but doubles its own Power, and Wong, which lets abilities happen twice.

  While the three-turn limit settled into place very quickly, the variable scale - in which players receive between 2-5 energy per turn - took a lot of experimentation. Hayes credits Jules Robins, the lead designer of the High Voltage mode, with the creation of the scale. Initially, the team tried a fixed system, such as receiving three energy on Turn 3, six on Turn 2, and nine on Turn 3. However, this led to players being extremely conservative, sticking to 3- or 6-energy cards such as Thanos or Magneto, rather than experimenting.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "They kind of ran into that problem with every set of numbers, and the experimentation just became way less interesting. But then, when we made it a range, your shackles came off a little bit, and you were like "Well, I'm just going to have a lot of energy. I'm just going to put a lot of cool, expensive stuff in the deck, and just kind of see what happens.""

 <p>
  It was when the energy scale was implemented, Hayes explained, that High Voltage truly started to come together as a unique mode. He and the team are extremely excited to see the kind of decks players will build over the eight days in which High Voltage mode is available for play - particularly the unique and powerful card combinations that may come into play.

      <title>19 Best PlayStation Plus Horror Games, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  In 2022, Sony revamped
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  , starting a new era for the service. Nowadays, players can pick from three tiers: Essential, Extra, or Premium. If someone wants to play online, they will need to subscribe to, at least, PS Plus Essential to access most games' multiplayer modes. This tier also provides a few freebies per month. However, people craving
  <strong>
   PS Plus horror games
  </strong>
  will probably need to take a look at the second and third tiers.

 <p>
  The Extra tier provides access to hundreds of PS5 and PS4 titles, and that library is expanded each month with roughly 15 games. The Premium level includes all of Extra's games, along with hundreds of classic PS3, PS2, PS1, and PSP projects. Unsurprisingly, Sony's service has most of its genre fundamentals covered, ensuring there should be a few dozen games that suit most people's needs. This statement includes horror, and the
  <strong>
   scariest PS Plus games
  </strong>
  rank among the best games on the subscription service.

  OK,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is, at best, horror adjacent, and even that is a bit of a stretch. Still, zombies are a central tenant of the genre, so Dambuster's sequel deserves a special mention since it could still hit the mark with people looking for an action romp with light RPG and horror elements. Just to be clear, the campaign has a very lighthearted tone and is mostly led by quippy protagonists who largely seem like they are too worried about being stuck in an undead-infested Los Angeles.

 <p>
  Lack of scares aside,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is a lot of fun, at least when it comes to combat. Blending melee and ranged, the game utilizes a dismemberment system that is satisfying and suitably gory. While allowing for some minor exploration, the levels are fairly linear and do not usually overstay their welcome.

   Dino Crisis 3
  </em>
  ; consequently, this PS Plus arrival is a pretty big deal since it indicates that Capcom has not completely forgotten about the IP.

  Basically,
  <em>
   Dino Crisis
  </em>
  is
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  with guns, utilizing tank controls, fixed cameras, and limited ammo to provide a fairly identical experience. The game leans into action slightly more than
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  's PS1 originals, but it is still very much horror. While not everything has aged perfectly,
  <em>
   Dino Crisis
  </em>
  is still a blast.

  Although hardly exclusive to PlayStation ecosystems,
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  will always be associated with the brand thanks to the original PS1 trilogy. Those three games arguably defined survival horror, even if they were not the genre's first representatives. While not containing these influential titles in their original forms, PS Plus nevertheless shows a lot of love for Capcom's franchise, particularly the Premium tier. Subscribers can play through masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil Director's Cut
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  (not remake), co-op goodies like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , and acquired tastes like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Operation Raccoon City
  </em>
  ​​​​​​.

  Concerning PS Plus Extra, the 2019
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake is available to download, and it is fantastic. With
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , Capcom took the license in a new direction by switching to a first-person angle, a change that was generally a positive one. However, the publisher also wanted to cater to long-time fans who yearned for something a bit closer to the classic releases –
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  was that game. A proper survival horror experience, the remake is a visual treat that retains the original's intensity and stellar level design.
  <em>
   RE2
  </em>
  would go on to spawn two more remakes, and while both of those projects are must-plays in their own right, the original is arguably still the best of the bunch.

  With PS Plus Extra and Premium, players have the option to download and play games directly from their console's internal storage. This benefits several horror experiences that can be found on the subscription service, which would otherwise suffer from lag induced by slow internet connection speeds. Supermassive Games'
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  is perhaps the biggest benefactor of this, due to the rapid twitch gameplay players will often find themselves experiencing while they're desperately fighting to see the sun again.

 <p>
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  calls back to the horror genre's classic use of jump-scares, as it follows the story of a group of friends who are being haunted by their past. Crucially the narrative carries on whenever a character is killed by the player's actions, creating a sense of dreadful permanence. Because of this, Supermassive's cinematic story is an excellent depiction of interactive choose-your-own-adventure gameplay and is arguably still the studio's best work to this day.

  Although hardly the first franchise to go down the defenseless protagonist route,
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  might be the most famous example of this trend, at least in terms of pure exposure. The original game is, unfortunately, not available on Sony's subscription service, but the sequel is not only part of the lineup but also one of the
  <strong>
   scariest PS Plus games
  </strong>
  . Cast as a cameraman, players find themselves in the middle of a bloody ritual, which will put them directly in the crosshairs of quite a few horrifying villains.

  <em>

  strips players of most defenses, forcing them into an intense game of hide and seek that can (occasionally) feel a bit unfair. While not always the most "enjoyable" experience, the story is deeply unsettling and disconcerting, touching upon themes that are horrific in concept and execution.
  <em>

  Both of Tango Gameworks'
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  games are on PS Plus Extra, and they are must-plays for anyone remotely interested in survival horror. They are inspired by
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , although they do change enough elements to stand on their own two feet. Even if it can be frustrating in places, the original 2014 game is the best entry point into the series for newcomers, and it is arguably more intense than its successor.
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  introduces Sebastian Castellanos, a detective who gets dragged into a strange nightmare while investigating a murder case. The story predominantly takes place in a hospital, albeit one laced with surreal and terrifying imagery.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1093} -->

 <p>
  <em>
   The Evil Within 2
  </em>
  expands on its predecessor's ideas, all the while implementing a sandbox that grants players more freedom. This time, Sebastian enters a simulated town that is home to his supposedly deceased daughter. Union takes a fairly conventional setting and twists it, creating a feeling that something terrible could be lurking around every other corner. While the frights do not come around as frequently as in the first game, the gameplay is generally superior in the sequel.

  Another Supermassive production,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  is a strange beast since, on the one hand, the overall project is probably the studio's most ambitious to date; however, the individual games are not quite as fulfilling as
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  . As its name suggests,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  revolves around standalone stories loosely connected through a framing device, although they are largely designed to be played in isolation. PS Plus Extra has the franchise's four non-VR games:
  <em>
   Man of Medan
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Little Hope
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Devil in Me
  </em>
  , all of which only require roughly 5–6 hours to complete.

  Each title has different characters and settings, although they generally feature the same style of mechanics and scares. While neither entry is a masterpiece on its own,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  is nevertheless a great recommendation for horror fans, particularly ones who are looking for co-op experiences. The latter feature defines this series, and both online and couch co-op are well executed.

  PS Plus Premium has the PS2's
  <em>
   Siren
  </em>
  and its 2008 reimagining,
  <em>
   Siren: Blood Curse
  </em>
  . Even though neither is an all-time classic, they are both above-average survival horror games with interesting ideas; however,
  <em>
   Blood Curse
  </em>
  is a bit easier to revisit in this day and age. Split into episodes and featuring a rotating cast of controllable characters,
  <em>
   Blood Curse
  </em>
  follows a TV crew as they investigate the rural Hanuda Japanese village. Naturally, they quickly find that this desolate town is home to some rather dangerous entities.

 <p>
  <em>
   Siren: Blood Curse
  </em>
  incorporates stealth into its gameplay loop since the characters are largely defenseless. To facilitate this element, players have the power to temporarily view the world from the perspective of an enemy, which allows them to plan their actions accordingly. This concept sets
  <em>
   Siren
  </em>
  apart from other horror franchises and is arguably at its best in

  June 2024 was a big month for PS Plus. For the first time, Sony announced that PS VR2 games would be coming to the service, with 7 projects dropping within the month. Provided somebody has the peripheral, they will have access to some of the best PS VR2 projects on the market, including a horror two-parter that has ties to a huge property.

  Set in a flooded New Orleans,
  <em>
   The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners
  </em>
  casts players as the Tourist, and their "ultimate" goal is to find a stash of valuable items. However, the campaign mainly revolves around surviving, both in terms of crafting resources and just withstanding the aggressive and terrifying Walkers. While not quite as big as the ones found in

   Days Gone
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   World War Z

  <em>
   Alone in the Dark
  </em>
  has a peculiar legacy. Undeniably one of the most influential horror games ever, the 1992 original was groundbreaking at the time of its release, and it spawned a couple of quick sequels. Although the first entry is worth playing just from a historical standpoint, the franchise's 90s titles have not aged particularly well and can be difficult to appreciate in this day and age. After the turn of the century, the license would come and go, occasionally dropping a divisive project. 2008's
  <em>
   Alone in the Dark
  </em>
  's good ideas are let down by inconsistent execution, and the same can be said for 2024's reboot.
  <em>
   Alone in the Dark: Illumination
  </em>
  is plainly terrible.

 <p>
  That leaves 2001's
  <em>
   The New Nightmare
  </em>
  , a well-received entry that has arguably blossomed into the franchise's best title. Even though it is nowhere near as important as 1992's
  <em>
   Alone in the Dark
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The New Nightmare
  </em>
  has stood the test of time better, providing the person playing it is fond of fixed-camera survival horror games from the PS1 era. Essentially creating a soft reboot, Darkworks opted to combine the previous titles' unsettling tone and puzzles with gameplay similar to
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  . Despite taking clear inspiration from the latter, this title does not struggle to carve a unique identity, largely thanks to its solid writing, well-designed island setting, and diverse monster designs.

  is a bit all over the place, but its ambition cannot be faulted. Set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, players take control of a scientist who is trying to recruit characters in the hope of finding his fiancée, which is easier said than done considering the whole area is a war zone that also happens to contain supernatural monsters.

  OK,
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  is a special case since it is not scary, nor does it try to be. Still, if someone is craving a unique spin on cosmic terror, there are not many better
  <strong>
   PS Plus horror games
  </strong>
  than Black Salt's twisted take on fishing. Set in Greater Marrow, players step into the shoes of a new fisherman who has just arrived in one of the few towns in this area. Saddled with a small debt that can be quickly paid off, the protagonist spends his days traveling the archipelago's waters in search of fish to catch and wooden logs to haul (among other things). Putting aside the somewhat creepy folk who live in this area, this life seems pretty chill; however, that changes when darkness sets in. If players get caught out late or decide to do some nighttime fishing, they might find themselves staring at unfathomable creatures ripped right out of HP Lovecraft's nightmares.

  Rather than jump scares or gory displays,
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  's horror comes entirely from the atmosphere it creates, along with a constant sense of dread that permeates this universe. Every NPC seems like they have seen things they cannot explain, and they act like they are trapped without any hope of escape. The game uses a Panic meter that sets in whenever the fisherman is caught out at sea during the night, a situation that will gradually become commonplace as the story unfolds. Beyond just the terrors from the deep,
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  also builds a sense of mystery through its pretty decent story and quest system.

  Despite losing steam relatively quickly,
  <em>
   F.E.A.R.
  </em>
  had a really strong debut that instantly established the horror property as a franchise to keep an eye on. Although solid in their own right, the sequels failed to fully capture the magic of the original game, and some of that can be credited to their transition to full-blown shooters at the expense of their horror elements. As an FPS,
  <em>
   F.E.A.R.
  </em>
  was and still is decent, even if its gunplay nowadays shows its age; however, the campaign expertly weaves in creepy, nightmarish flashes, and these moments set the project apart from its contemporaries.

 <p>
  Even nearly two decades later, there are not many games that try to blend these two genres, and even fewer that are as successful as
  <em>
   F.E.A.R.
  </em>
  Along with haunting imagery courtesy of the terrifying but iconic Alma, the title also tells an effective story that holds quite a few surprises. As dated as some aspects of this project might be,
  <em>
   F.E.A.R.
  </em>
  is still one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus horror games

  Thanks to Naughty Dog's trademark cinematic pedigree, it's sometimes easy to forget that
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is actually a horror game. A testament to the engaging characters found at its core, the zombies that haunt the game's streets sometimes take a back seat when fans talk about the franchise. That's not to say that the hordes of the transformed are to be taken for granted though, as throughout the experience they'll provide more than enough scares.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  hits a sweet spot when it comes to horror in this way. At times, the game offers palpable physical nightmares like any strong piece of zombie media, whilst also never forgetting to embody the psychological element of the genre at every other opportunity. The world that Naughty Dog has built is packed with such attention to detail that it ensures the presence and threat of the infected is a constant thought in the mind of the player, whether they're on-screen or not.

  Since the release of
  <em>
   Demon’s Souls
  </em>
  in 2009, FromSoftware has developed a reputation for creating games with brutal difficulty spikes and addictive action mechanics. While that combination can often serve up scary times in most of its titles,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  represents the studio’s most overt attempt at creating something within the horror genre. Even though its gameplay will entice many players, horror fans in particular with PS Plus Extra won’t want to miss out either.

  Inspired heavily by gothic literature, exploring the streets of

  Deck-builders do not exactly scream "horror," but
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  loves to defy expectations. A game of many hats, a huge part of the experience's appeal hinges on its willingness to take risks, most of which not only pay off but also instill players with an irresistible desire to see what comes next. As it would be a disservice to reveal the campaign's mysteries, let's focus on
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  's basics instead.

 <p>
  Players find themselves sitting opposite a strange being, who they will need to defeat in a grueling but well-done card game. The latter's mechanics are fairly typical for the genre, but its fundamentals are sound and there are enough twists to give it a bit of flavor. The horror elements primarily come from everything that transpires around the table, and players are encouraged to step away from the cards in between matches.
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  is also a roguelike, so defeat does reset a run to an extent; however, the game is not too difficult by the genre's standards.

  Since its debut back in 2016, Behaviour Interactive’s
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  has steadily grown into something of a horror game phenomenon. Throughout that time it should be noted that its key gameplay principles have remained largely intact. Four teammates are still forced to desperately fight for survival against another solo player, who’s able to control a supernatural entity. The setup for the game is simple yet effective, to the point that it’s easy to imagine it receiving a player-base boost via its recent arrival on PS Plus Extra.

 <p>
  Something that has helped
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  to stand out from other multiplayer horror contemporaries, and has become its biggest selling point, is its ever-growing list of crossovers. Thanks to a steady stream of downloadable content drops over the last few years, the title now features an extensive roster of playable horror movie and game icons. Between tie-ins with the
  <em>
   Halloween
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  , players can enjoy a multiplayer experience with horror icons, even if the game itself is not that scary after a few runs.

  Set in a world devastated by the “Gyldenize” disease,
  <em>
   Mistfall Hunter
  </em>
  sees a mysterious and supernatural girl raise heroes from the dead to fight against invading creatures in an attempt to restore the Web of Fate.

Third-person action, PvP strategy, and combo-heavy combat await in
  <em>
   Mistfall Hunter
  </em>
  , which will join some of the best PvPvE games, including
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . PC users can now register for the RPG’s upcoming open beta by visiting
  <em>
   Mistfall Hunter
  </em>
  ’s official website.

  The extraction looter is thought to be a mix of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ’ hardest bosses and punishing combat with the adrenaline-fueled atmosphere of Battlestate Games’ first-person shooter
  <em>
   Escape from Tarkov
  </em>
  . The general gaming community received Mistfall Hunter well, jumping on social media to praise its intriguing setting and interesting blend of genres. The game currently has a release window of 2025, so interested players won’t have to wait long to play the game in full.

  The RPG’s announcement trailer certainly oozed Soulslike vibes, narrating engaging storytelling tidbits akin to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ’s rich Erdtree lore. Gamers even went as far as to compare Dew, the young girl from the trailer, to FromSoftware’s Queen Marika the Eternal, and the Ubisoft community also saw similarities between
  <em>
   Mistfall Hunter
  </em>
  ’s environments and the upcoming
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Hexe
  </em>
  . One thing’s for certain, Soulslike fans have plenty to look forward to.

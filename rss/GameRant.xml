   <em>
    Slime Rancher
   </em>
  </strong>
  has players taking control of protagonist Beatrix LeBeau through an indie life sim gameplay experience, exploring locations on a new planet, progressing their ranch, and discovering and taming endearing and interesting little creatures known as Slimes. There are a wide variety of different Slimes available in the game, each of which has its own unique habitat and interests, including a favorite food.

  In
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  , food is an important mechanic as it enables you to feed items to your Slimes and have them produce ports, as well as actively reduce their hunger and agitation. Every Slime in the game also has a unique diet, and while a Slime will have a favorite food within its diet, it will also not eat food outside its diet at all. Everything you need to know about the favorite food of every Slime — and where every food item can be sourced — has been included in the guide below.

  Carlotta is the first 5-star limited pistol character in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  , introduced with the release of the new Rinascita region in version 2.0. As one of the highlights of this major update, Carlotta brings a fresh and dynamic playstyle, perfectly suited for exploring the new areas, especially if players have been looking to try out new characters
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2216733">
   for overworld exploration
  </span>
  . Her fast-paced ranged attacks may be refreshing experience for both veteran and new players alike.

 <p>
  With Rinascita introducing new enemies and a fresh
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2222625">
   set of echo sets
  </span>
  , Carlotta’s optimal build heavily leans toward one of these new sets tailored to her playstyle. However, players who don't want to farm the new sets right away can still utilize older, pre-existing echo sets as placeholders, ensuring Carlotta remains functional while progressing. Here's a breakdown of Carlotta's
  <strong>
   best echo sets
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   stat priorities
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   weapons
  </strong>
  to maximize her potential in Wuthering Waves.

 <p>
  Carlotta’s performance in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  centers around optimizing Resonance Skill DMG and Glacio DMG Bonus, making her build straightforward yet reliant on specific gear choices. The introduction of
  <strong>
   Frosty Resolve
  </strong>
  from Rinascita provides her with a tailored option that perfectly aligns with her abilities, offering exceptional bonuses when fully activated. This new set grants a combination of Resonance Skill DMG and
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2174197">
   Glacio DMG Bonus
  </span>
  , reaching up to 48% and 45% respectively at maximum stacks. These effects make Frosty Resolve her best option, as its activation conditions are easily met through her playstyle. Players equipping Frosty Resolve should use the Sentry Construct as the main echo, as its effects are specifically designed to complement this set and will be the only 4-cost echo from this set as of now.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those who want to take their time to farm Frosty Resolve,
  <strong>
   Freezing Frost
  </strong>
  remains a strong placeholder, providing a consistent 40% Glacio DMG Bonus at five pieces. Although it lacks Resonance Skill DMG, it still boosts Carlotta’s elemental output effectively. When using Freezing Frost, Lampylumen serves as the ideal main echo to maximize this set’s utility and it's the only 4-cost echo from this set. While Freezing Frost is serviceable, transitioning to Frosty Resolve should be a priority for players who wish to fully optimize Carlotta’s potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of stat priorities, Carlotta’s echoes should focus on
  <strong>
   Crit Rate
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Crit DMG
  </strong>
  for 4-cost echoes, depending on what balances her ratio more effectively. For 3-cost echoes, players can choose between
  <strong>
   ATK%
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Glacio DMG Bonus
  </strong>
  . ATK% is generally more versatile and beneficial unless sub-stats already provide a significant amount of ATK%, in which case Glacio DMG Bonus becomes more valuable. For 1-cost echoes,
  <strong>
   ATK%
  </strong>
  is the optimal choice. Sub-stats should prioritize
  <strong>
   Crit DMG, Crit Rate,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   ATK%,
  </strong>
  with
  <strong>
   Resonance Skill DMG Bonus
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Energy Regen
  </strong>
  as secondary focuses. Maintaining at least 120% Energy Regen is crucial to ensure frequent use of Resonance Liberation, which activates Carlotta’s echo effects, set bonuses, and even weapon effect if players opt for her signature weapon.

 <p>
  As the only 5-star
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2172676">
   limited pistol user
  </span>
  currently available, Carlotta has a limited selection of high-rarity weapons that suit her playstyle, but the available options are impactful. Her signature weapon,
  <strong>
   The Last Dance
  </strong>
  , stands out as the best choice, offering a massive Crit DMG stat alongside an effect that further increases ATK and enhances Resonance Skill DMG. This weapon synergizes perfectly with Carlotta’s reliance on Resonance Skills and her overall damage scaling, making it an essential pick for maximizing her potential. Additionally, The Last Dance is relatively versatile, meaning that it can benefit other pistol users in the current roster, making it a worthwhile long-term investment.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those unable to obtain her signature weapon,
  <strong>
   Static Mist
  </strong>
  serves as a strong alternative. As a standard weapon banner option, it provides high base ATK, an additional ATK buff, and Energy Regen, while also offering Crit Rate as its secondary stat. This makes Static Mist a well-rounded and accessible choice, especially for players focusing on maintaining energy consistency for Carlotta’s Resonance Liberation.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players looking for 4-star alternatives,
  <strong>
   Thunderbolt
  </strong>
  from the Battle Pass is the most effective option. It increases ATK through its substat and boosts Resonance Skill DMG via its weapon effect, which aligns well with Carlotta’s damage priorities. A similar option from the gacha system is
  <strong>
   Undying Flame
  </strong>
  , which provides comparable benefits. Another viable 4-star option is
  <strong>
   Relativistic Jet
  </strong>
  , which focuses on boosting ATK% and offers additional energy regeneration. While these options won’t match the damage output of her 5-star weapons, they still enable Carlotta to perform effectively in most team compositions, making them excellent choices for players on a tighter budget or those who are just starting out.

 <p>
  Carlotta's damage primarily comes from her Resonance Skill and Resonance Liberation, which means players should prioritize these over others, especially since some materials needed to upgrade her Forte may take time to obtain as they drop from a new set of enemies. With that in mind, the Forte priority is as follows:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Resonance Liberation = Resonance Skill
  </li>
  <li>
   Forte Circuit
  </li>
  <li>
   Normal Attack
  </li>
  <li>
   Intro Skill

  Excluding Special Illustration and other rare variants,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Mythical Island introduced 68 new and reworked cards, with Mew ex as the featured one. The mini-set was generally well-received, and players seem pleased with its impact on the metagame, encouraging more creative deck-building. However, not every card in the Mythical Island expansion was a hit. In fact, some were outright disappointing Pokemon that will likely be forgotten in a few months. Here’s a list of those “not-so-great” cards from
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  ’s Mythical Island mini-set.

  The List’s Criteria
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Abilities and effects
   </strong>
   : One of the main criteria for this ranking is the card’s text, effect, and damage. Cards with mediocre abilities or Energy-heavy attacks are considered less favorable.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Synergies with current META decks
   </strong>
   : Cards with little to no synergy with top-performing decks or those without new synergies are ranked lower.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Fanbase reception
   </strong>
   : The overall reactions to the cards in the Mythical Island expansion have also influenced these rankings.

  The introduction of cards like Vaporeon in Mythical Island and the rise of Gyarados ex might create the illusion that there’s more room for cards like Drednaw. However, that’s just excessive optimism. Drednaw has failed to find a place in the current metagame for several reasons—all listed below:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Drednaw is a Stage One Pokemon
   </strong>
   . The player must spend time and effort evolving it, which isn’t worth it in most META Water-Type decks.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Drednaw requires three Water Energies
   </strong>
   . In exchange, it only deals 70 damage and has a “chance” to discard one Energy from the opponent’s Active Pokemon. That’s not a tempting trade-off.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Drednaw isn’t Retreat-friendly
   </strong>
   . Even if the player uses their Leaf on Drednaw, it still requires one additional Energy to retreat, thanks to its hefty three-Energy Retreat cost.

 <p>
  Galvantula is facing an existential crisis in
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  ’s current META. It’s probably wondering why it was created in the first place, as the Lightning-Type archetype has no room for this Pokemon. That said, fans have managed to build quirky decks with Galvantula, decks that can frustrate the opponent to the point of an early concession. But is that enough to save Galvantula’s status? Not really.
 </p>
 <p>
  The issue is that Galvantula is either a game-changing play or just an annoying card to disrupt the opponent. There’s no real middle ground, which is disappointing. While the Pokemon offers consistent damage and effects, it’s not always the best choice in Lightning-Type decks, which is why it ended up on this list.

 <p>
  The new Primeape is one of the weirdest cards in the Mythical Island expansion. It’s a debuffed variant that raises the question: why would players choose this one over the Genetic Apex version? This new variant deals a solid 50 damage for two Fighting-Type Energies, offering more consistency. But the thing is, the Genetic Apex Primeape deals a net 40 damage for the same Energy cost, has 10 more HP, and, more importantly, can buff its attack by 60 (dealing 100 damage in total).
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes it worse for the new Primeape is that the older variant is highly sought after in the current META as a reliable counter to Druddigon. And since Druddigon has been rising in popularity, there’s little reason for players to choose the Mythical Island Primeape over the Genetic Apex one.

 <p>
  On the surface, Mythical Island’s Ponyta seems like an improvement or a buff. However, the actual drawback of playing this variant emerges when the player does the math. If an attack deals 40 damage but only has a 50% chance of occurring, its average damage output is equivalent to a guaranteed 20-damage attack. This is because the expected damage is calculated as 40 × 0.5 = 20.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some might argue that Mythical Island’s Ponyta synergizes with the new Rapidash, as they both introduce RNG risk for a potential reward. However, what’s clear in
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  ’s META so far is that decks centered around coin tosses often struggle to perform well in high-level competitive matches, where consistency is key. So, even if there is synergy between the two new cards, it’s ultimately redundant.

 <p>
  Florges is an interesting case. On paper, the premise seems promising: a Pokemon that can occupy the Active Spot for a while and heal teammates on the Bench. With Florges being a Psychic-Type and the recent addition of Mew ex and Budding Expeditioner, it appears to be set for success. Theoretically, Florges can heal Retreated Pokemon while Mew ex returns to hand and heals itself using Budding Expeditioner—a win-win situation. However, that’s not what usually happens.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main issue is that Florges is a Stage Two Pokemon, which significantly hampers its effectiveness. Mewtwo ex decks are already slow due to Gardevoir’s Evolution line. Adding Florges to this already crowded lineup only makes things worse. By the time Florges is ready, the opponent has likely put their primary DPS on the Active Spot, and that Pokemon will likely one-shot Florges after a round.

 <p>
  Slurpuff is the worst card in the Mythical Island expansion. It's nearly impossible to find or assemble a META-friendly deck that can benefit from this Pokemon. Slurpuff is a Stage One Psychic-Type that deals 60 damage with one Psychic and one Colorless Energy. And that’s about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only positive for Slurpuff is its weakness to Steel. Currently, the metagame has very few strong Steel-Type lineups that could exploit this. However, that alone isn’t enough to boost its standing. It's hard to imagine a future where Slurpuff will play a significant role in the META. But only time will tell.

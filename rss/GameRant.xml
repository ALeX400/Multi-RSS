      Fans anticipate a new Death Stranding 2 trailer or release date announcement at Gamescom, but Tokyo Game Show may hold bigger surprises.

  Numerous recent teases suggest that the upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive
  <em>
   <strong>
    Death Stranding 2: On The Beach
   </strong>
  </em>
  will seemingly receive more information at the upcoming Gamescom 2024 live show. The game was last featured at the January 2024 State of Play with an unusually long 9-minute trailer, and fans have been wondering when they'll get to see more of
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  First revealed under the codename
  <em>
   DS2
  </em>
  at the 2022 Game Awards,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2: On The Beach
  </em>
  is the much-awaited sequel to Hideo Kojima's
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  . The 2022 trailer showed the return of Norman Reedus as an older Sam Porter Bridges, as well as glimpses of other characters and the game's general setting. The longer State of Play trailer for
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  , meanwhile, revealed some story details and a 2025 release window. However, its cryptic pacing and surrealistic scenes made it rather difficult for fans to decipher, leading to calls for more information about
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While it's heavily rumored that Hideo Kojima will be present at September's Tokyo Game Show to present a new trailer for
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  , it appears fans can expect more information about the game rather imminently. A recent tweet from Kojima teases a concealed
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  character, who will seemingly be played by Japanese actor Kenjiro Tsuda. The timing of the tweet is very curious, as Gamescom Opening Night Live will air on August 20. Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley has also retweeted the
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  tease, heavily hinting at the game being featured during tomorrow's event.

 <p>
  Strengthening the notion further is another recent tweet from Kojima, which showed Elle Fanning's
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  character in what appears to be a cutscene. Keighley responded to this tweet with the double-eyes emoji, yet again teasing Kojima's involvement in Gamescom 2024. Kojima has frequently used Keighley's events to announce his games as well, like the experimental Xbox title
  <em>
   OD
  </em>
  at the 2023 Game Awards, so the evidence does line up in favor of a new
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  trailer or information dropping imminently at Gamescom.

 <p>
  It'll be interesting to see what Kojima potentially has in store for
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  fans at Gamescom 2024, with speculation ranging from an all-new story trailer to a simple release date announcement and some new details. Tempering expectations would be a safe bet, though, as
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  publisher PlayStation will attend Tokyo Game Show as a general exhibitor after a hiatus of five years, so it may choose to reserve bigger details about the game until then.

  Once you make it to the 20th floor of the Mines in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fields of Mistria
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there will be a
  <strong>
   Water Seal
  </strong>
  that needs to be broken. The tablet will be in an unknown language, so you'll need to take a rubbing of it to
  <strong>
   Eiland
  </strong>
  so they can translate the text. You'll get the Water Tablet Rubbing, which will kick off the '
  <strong>
   The Water Tablet' quest
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Find Eiland on the map, show him the tablet, and he'll take you to their office. Once the text is translated, you'll finally learn the required items needed to break the water seal: One
  <strong>
   Lantern Moth
  </strong>
  , one
  <strong>
   Ruby
  </strong>
  , one
  <strong>
   Stone Loach
  </strong>
  , and one
  <strong>
   Upper Mines Mushroom.

  To start, you'll need to catch a

   Lantern Moth
  </strong>
  with a bug net, which will be found in the early levels of the Mine, specifically in the Upper Mines. They will appear near lanterns and other sources of light.

  And last but not least, we have the

 <p>
  Niantic has confirmed that an upcoming update to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be adding Morpeko, who will be able to transform mid-battle by using a Charged Attack.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has enjoyed such incredible longevity thanks to the steady stream of new content that has been released for the augmented reality mobile game over the years. Fans constantly have new Pokemon, quests, and gameplay features to check out, giving them good reason to play each and every single day.

 <p>
  At the time of this writing, it's not possible to catch all Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , but Niantic has continued to make strides toward that goal. Batches of new Pokemon are added to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  every season, and now Niantic has started to tease new Pokemon that will be added at some point in the near future.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  will be adding Generation 8 Pokemon Morpeko in a future update. Morpeko is a unique Pokemon in that it can switch between two different types. While in Full Belly Mode, Morpeko is an Electric-type, but while in Hagrny Mode, Morpeko is a Dark-type. This unique trait will be featured in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  as well, with players able to switch types by using Morpeko's Charged Attack Aura Wheel. This will make Morpeko one of the more unique Pokemon available in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . A specific release date for Morpeko in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  hasn't been announced at the time of this writing. Other Pokemon will be able to change forms in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  battles as well, but for now the focus is on Morpeko.

  When Morpeko joins

  , but perhaps they will join the game alongside Morpeko. Specifics to that effect haven't been announced, but fans of the game should keep an eye out for more info.

  Limited Run Games is partnering with Sega to create a special Collector’s Edition of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic X Shadow Generations
   </em>
  </strong>
  , complete with an assortment of bonuses crafted for die-hard fans.
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations

  is set to launch on October 22, bringing the 2010 anniversary title to modern consoles with a new story campaign centered around Shadow as he faces off against enemies and locations from his past.

 <p>
  Over the past few months, the developers behind
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  have been showing off some of the new levels found in Shadow’s campaign, including those drawn from less-fondly remembered installments like
  <em>
   Sonic 06
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shadow the Hedgehog
  </em>
  . Sega has also revealed some of the bonuses for those who pre-order
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , such as an alternate Sonic skin inspired by his bulkier appearance in the original
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  and a reversible cover featuring the game’s Japanese box art.

  Stickers are collectible items in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  that add an extra layer of fun and strategy to the game. These cards are organized into albums, each containing multiple sticker sets that highlight different aspects of the album’s theme. Collecting all the stickers in a set rewards you with dice rolls, cash, and other goodies, while completing an entire album gives you a special grand prize.

  You can collect stickers by participating in events and tournaments, completing quick wins, spinning the Color Set wheel, or even purchasing them with real money. With time, you can collect hundreds of extra stickers. Thankfully, all of these duplicate Stickers can be exchanged for rewards in the Stickers for Rewards section.

   Previously, a Gold Vault used to reward Monopoly GO players with a Wild Sticker, a rare card that allowed you to choose any missing sticker to complete a set. However, Scopely has switched things up and removed the Wild Sticker in its newest update. This guide has now been updated with the new Gold Vault rewards and includes tips on when to open it for maximum benefits.

  Stickers for Rewards is an exciting feature in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  that turns all duplicate stickers into Stars, which can then be used to open three kinds of vaults. These safes can be opened
  <strong>
   every 24 hours
  </strong>
  and contain lots of goodies. To find the Stickers for Rewards in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , players need to click on
  <strong>
   Albums
  </strong>
  and then tap on the
  <strong>
   small safe
  </strong>
  in the lower right corner of the screen.

 <p>
  On the Stickers for Rewards screen, you can see your total sticker stars balance and three types of vaults, with varying costs and rewards.
  <strong>
   The more stars you spend, the better rewards you will be able to get.

 <p>
  The Gold Vault is the highest tier of reward in the
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  ’s Stickers for Rewards section. As such, many players hold on to their stars and keep collecting more stickers so that they can buy the Gold Vault. In this scenario, it’s important to wait for the right time and resist the urge to open the vault straight away.

 <p>
  The best time to open the Gold Vault is when you’ve completed most of your Sticker Album and are down to
  <strong>
   only five-star stickers
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  both gold and non-gold cards.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  The Purple sticker pack in the Gold Vault guarantees a five-star sticker, which could help you complete your remaining sets faster.

 <p>
  Besides that, it’s worth waiting for the
  <strong>
   Sticker Boom
  </strong>
  event before opening the Gold Vault, since this flash event increases the number of stickers players can get when they open a sticker pack.

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  is removing the Guild Name Change service from the Shop and Battle.net on April 22 in favor of the feature being available in-game for 200,000 gold. Once this change arrives, ostensibly with the next content update, the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  in-game store will no longer have any guild game services available for purchase.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.1.5 arrived on the Public Test Realm, giving fans a hands-on look at the upcoming update. While exploring the game and its files, players discovered a new option within
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  itself that allows fans to rename their guild, rather than relying on the paid Guild Name Change service in the cash shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has revealed more details about how this feature will work – and that the paid Guild Name Change will be retired soon. In a forum post by
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  community manager Linxy, Blizzard confirmed that the Guild Masters in major cities will allow guild leaders to change the name of their guilds for 200,000 gold starting April 22. What’s more, the Guild Name Change service will be removed from Battle.net and the in-game Shop at the same time.

 <p>
  Right now, Guild Name Changes cost $20 on the in-game store, the same price as a single WoW Token. The gold price for the currency fluctuates, as it did when
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  released the $90 Brutosaur mount last year, but it usually averages at around 250,000 gold, meaning this new in-game Guild Name Change will typically cost less than it would have before the change. The datamined strings for this feature suggested a single guild could only change its name once a year, but the forum post made no mention of any limitations, so players will have to wait until April 22 to see further specifics.

  In July 2024,
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  retired the Guild Realm Transfer and Guild Faction Transfer services from the in-game store. When the Guild Name Change leaves the Shop, there will be no more paid guild services for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The April 22 date for this game service change also all but confirms the release date for Patch 11.1.5. Evidence from a splash screen on
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.1.5 PTR already suggested the patch might arrive on April 22 – and considering the in-game guild name change service is a feature of that upcoming update, this announcement only further supports the speculative date. Fans likely won’t have to wait long for an official announcement from Blizzard.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games in years. Its combat is highly polished, its game modes are enjoyable, and the visuals and sound design are top-notch. However, some new players may not be happy that they need to unlock all of the game's guns and perks before they can use them in multiplayer matches, especially if their weapon of choice is unlocked at a high level.
 </p>

 <p>
  Guns like the AS VAL and GPMG-7 don't become available until after players have hit level 50, which can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, by utilizing
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  double XP weekends, players can get everything unlocked a whole lot faster. To ensure that players never miss out, the following guide will be updated whenever a
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  double XP weekend gets announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated March 25, 2025, by Tom Bowen:
   </strong>
   To celebrate the imminent arrival of Season 3, Treyarch has announced a new BO6 double XP weekend, which will begin at 10:00 am Pacific on
   <strong>
    March 28
   </strong>
   . Those planning to participate should familiarize themselves with the start and end times listed below, as doing so will allow them to plan out their playtime and avoid missing out on potential gains.

  Capcom has announced that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  ' Title Update 1 will release on April 4 and bring several new features to the popular action RPG. This is the first of two major updates announced for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , with the second one scheduled to release in the summer of 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has been a big hit for Capcom, as it quickly became the fastest-selling title in the history of the company after its release on February 28, 2025. The highly anticipated action RPG was also popular with reviewers, as it has a score of 89 on OpenCritic as of writing. While some fans have complained about performance issues on PC, many players have been enjoying their time with the title, praising its open-world and story.
 </p>
 <p>
  During a major
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds

  Aside from
  <em>

  </em>
  ' Grand Hub, the star of the show was Mizutsune, the new snake-like leviathan monster that's guaranteed to present players with a whole new challenge. This isn't the first time Mizutsune has been seen in the franchise, as it has also appeared in previous titles like
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  . The trailer shows the fearsome creature attacking players and monsters alike with bubbles, water streams, and quick strikes that seem hard to predict. Gamers looking for even more of a challenge may be excited to learn that Capcom will be introducing Arch-Tempered Rey Dau, an even more powerful version of the formidable monster.

      <title>How to Get More Board Welcome Rewards in Monopoly GO</title>

 <p>
  Climbing your way to the top in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a lot of dice and other resources. Thankfully, the game is pretty generous with rewards. Players get daily treats and free gifts every eight hours that come with many useful items to keep them progressing.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->

  On top of that, there are welcome board rewards that you can claim. But can you increase these rewards? And if so, how do you do it? Let’s find out.

  How To Increase Board Welcome Rewards In Monopoly GO

 <p>
  First, let’s talk about what board welcome rewards are. In
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , whenever you finish a board and move on to the next one, the game gives you a little welcome gift. This reward usually includes things like dice rolls and cash to help you get started on the new board.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  has hundreds of boards, which means there are plenty of rewards waiting for you. In the first few boards, the rewards are pretty small, but as gamers keep completing their boards, the rewards get bigger and better.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only way to increase your board welcome rewards is by
  <strong>
   increasing your net worth
  </strong>
  . The higher your net worth, the better the rewards you will earn when you start a new board.
 </p>
 <p>
  To increase your
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  net worth, you’ll need to earn net worth points. The way to do this is simple: upgrade your buildings, which costs money.

  Each
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  board has five buildings, and fans can upgrade each one six times. The first upgrades are pretty cheap, but as you keep upgrading, they’ll get more and more expensive. Every single upgrade the player makes gives them one net worth point. And yes, you will also unlock many net worth abilities like Roll Regeneration and Rent Target along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrading a building in this 2023 board game is easy. To do this, tap on the ‘Build’ button at the bottom of your screen. This will open the build menu, where you’ll see all the buildings on your board. Now just choose the building you want to upgrade and hit the upgrade button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, earning money is not that hard in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , and you’ll naturally earn plenty of it as you go around your board. To boost your income, make sure to join events and tournaments, open community chests, and grab your daily freebies. Players can also get a nice flow of cash from property rent, so it would be a smart move to increase your dice multiplier when you are close to landing on rent tiles.

      <title>The Stars Could Finally Be Aligning for One Long-Awaited Chrono Trigger Project</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/chrono-trigger-hd-2d-remake-when-soon-2025-30th-anniversary/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  Few games have the kind of near-universal acclaim and staying power of a title like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Chrono Trigger
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which, even at 30 years old, somehow still feels fresh and forward-thinking. In conjunction with
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  's 30th anniversary on March 11, Square Enix took to social media to acknowledge the game's impact, while also assuring fans that they could expect "various"
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  -related projects over the course of the next year. Given how open Square Enix has been to reimagining beloved RPGs from its back catalog, it seems like an HD-2D remake of
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  might not be out of the question.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->

 <p>
  The HD-2D art style, which was popularized by Square Enix and Acquire's
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  , immediately stood out as the ideal visual template for modern-day remakes of classic RPGs, and it has since gone on to be used for titles like
  <em>
   Live A Live
  </em>
  and last year's
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  . Fans already have the HD-2D remakes of both the original
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 2
  </em>
  to look forward to in 2025, and considering the success of the
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  , and that the
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  games feature the art and character designs of the late Akira Toriyama, a
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  HD-2D remake makes a lot of sense, both financially and logistically.

  Square Enix's embracing of its past, and willingness to remaster, remake, and re-release beloved titles from its now-legendary back catalog, has proven to be incredibly successful, and one need look no further than
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D
  </em>
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  's success for evidence. The original
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  was the fastest and best-selling game in the series at the time of its release, a distinction that it still holds to this day as the single most successful entry in the long-running and foundational JRPG series. Unsurprising, then, that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  has only continued the title's success, selling more than 2 million units in less than six months.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's hard to imagine that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  's sales figures wouldn't inspire Square Enix to continue remaking or remastering other popular titles in the company's library, and it's similarly hard to think of a more beloved legacy Square Enix title than
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  . From purely a financial perspective, an HD-2D remake of
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  would be a surefire win for Square Enix, and the title's 30th anniversary creates the perfect window of opportunity for the company to strike while the iron is hot.

  Interestingly, rumors of a
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  remake being in the works have been circling for some time now, with leakers claiming that Square Enix had already completed a significant portion of work on the title as far back as 2023. What's even more interesting is that
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  share an important lineage, with
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series creator Yuji Horii and artist Akira Toriyama acting as two-thirds of the "Dream Team" that, along with
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, developed
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  . With players receiving HD-2D remakes of the first three
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  games in 2024 and 2025, there's every chance that several assets from those projects could easily be reused in a
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  HD-2D remake project.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering how important the title is to both the legacy of the SNES and the history of RPGs as a whole, it seems unlikely that Square Enix would let
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  's 30th anniversary pass by without a substantial celebration. So, while there is the possibility that
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  coming to modern platforms could simply be a re-release or port, it would feel like a missed opportunity for the project to not be larger in scope. Given the potential for success of an HD-2D remake of
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  , as well as how streamlined its potential ongoing development would be due to the work that has been done on the HD-2D remakes of the first three
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  games, a full-blown remake seems more likely than a remaster.

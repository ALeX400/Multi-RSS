 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </strong>
  </em>
  games encourage players to break the law and prioritize their own interests over everything else. The main and side content of these games lets players commit a litany of crimes to fill their own pockets.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is bound to attract police attention from time to time, which is why players are encouraged to evade the cops and let the heat die down before repeating the process. Better yet, players should be a bit subtle with their criminal endeavors and not commit felonies while the police are aware of their presence.

  Vehicular theft is second-nature for players in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  , which is perhaps why the series was named after this particular crime. Players can explore the open worlds of these games and grab a car if it catches their fancy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nothing stops them from pulling a civilian out of their car and manning it for themselves. It's one of the most common crimes in the game that players will carry out hundreds of times in each
  <em>
   GTA

  It goes without saying that people will fire their guns a lot in any
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  game. Missions involve players having to take down enemies by any means necessary, which usually means that players will be using a vast collection of firearms to decimate their foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players are feeling especially violent, they can acquire a bunch of creative, powerful weapons from Ammu-Nation and go wild in the sandbox. Sure, this will attract the attention of the police, but players can't expect to go postal in the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games without raising their Wanted Level.

  Given the crime-fueled life that players will lead in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  , it's easy to see why conducting robberies is as commonplace as they come. Most main missions early on in each respective
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game involve small-scale robberies that eventually balloon in scope.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is the best example of the same, with players planning various elaborate heists to line their pockets at numerous points in the story. These elaborate robberies see people tackle everything from jewelry stores to secure banks and everything in between, ensuring that players will be able to make a ton of cash in no time.

 <p>
  Some main missions in the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games involve players kidnapping characters and ransoming them for a hefty sum. The most notable example of this crime is in the fifth mainline entry, when Trevor kidnaps Martin Madrazo's wife without informing Michael, forcing the duo to go into hiding as they avoid the ire of the crime boss.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hilarious part is that Patricia, the kidnapee, and Trevor develop feelings for each other in one of the funniest depictions of Stockholm syndrome in the series. While this kidnapping is ultimately unfruitful for Trevor's financial aspirations, other
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games play it cut &amp; dry with this crime and ensure that the protagonist receives a decent payout for letting their prisoner go.

  had a great side gig where players could drive a van to a desolate house at night and conduct a robbery without alerting the residents. Players were encouraged to be quiet as they loaded their van with stolen goods for a sizeable payout.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making too much noise attracts unwanted heat and forces CJ to run away from pursuing cops. It was a fun side gig that features breaking and entering in a prominent capacity, and other
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  games have also shown characters breaking into properties they have no business being in.

  Setting things on fire is very cathartic in the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto

  series. Once players get their hands on weapons like the Flamethrower and Molotov Cocktails, it's hard not to set things ablaze with their destructive implements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  features a notable mission where CJ burns down a drug den owned by the Vagos, only to hear Denise shouting for help. They must enter the vicinity and brave the smoke as they save this innocent woman, who can later become their romantic interest.

 <p>
  Given the focus on crime in the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  games, it's easy to see why gang violence plays such a major role in these titles. Nowhere is this more prominent than in
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  , with Los Santos turning into a playground for players as they take over territories and establish dominance over the Ballas and Vagos.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   5
  </em>
  also have moments where players have to take out gang members in violent firefights, although it doesn't reach the scale of
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  . Seeing the hated Ballas fall by the dozens as CJ and his threadbare gang take out gangsters with military-grade firepower never ceases to be engaging.

  players are lying if they say that they've never run over a pedestrian or two (or a hundred) during their playthroughs. Driving around without any limits makes it so that players will enjoy a sadistic sense of glee as they knock over any pedestrian stupid enough to be standing in the way of their high-speed dealer of death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should be wary while driving dangerously, since too many incidents of vehicular manslaughter will lead to them attracting unwanted police attention in no time. It's a vicious loop players find themselves stuck in numerous times since it's so easy to let loose and drive at breakneck speeds without a care in the world.

      <title>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Best Maelle Weapons, Ranked</title>

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players are given a pretty large amount of freedom when it comes to build and character diversity when tackling the ever-growing threats in the mainland. Each party member has their own strengths and weaknesses and brings something different to the battle, whether it be high burst damage attacks or supportive tools to keep the party going for longer.
 </p>

 <p>
  Maelle is no exception to this rule, as she has plenty of skills in her arsenal to both deliver significant damage and sustain it thanks to her ability to swap stances, each offering its own effects. But skills are only half the story, as no expeditioner is battle-ready without a suitable armament to match their skillset, and there are plenty of great weapon choices for Maelle that can transform her fighting style in pretty significant ways.
 </p>
 <p>

    Updated September 6, 2025 by Oliver Tuscarny
   </strong>
   :
  </em>
  <em>
   While
   <strong>
    Clair Obscur
   </strong>
   has only received a few patches relating to bug fixes and some requested features like battle retries, players have still managed to find a bunch of new builds across all characters.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Maelle continues to be one of the strongest choices for most stages in the game, and by leveraging her insane damage potential, most bosses barely stand a chance. One of her more overpowered combos was nerfed, using Medallum and Stendhal for a huge burst of damage combined with defense, but the weapon itself remained untouched despite being bug-fixed to function as intended.

 <p>
  Fire is one of the better and more consistent damage types in the game, and Maelle has a pretty extensive list of skills that not only apply it but can buff it at the same time. Having a weapon that plays off of an already strong playstyle makes perfect sense, and Facesum is a great choice for a player looking to amp up their fire damage without ridiculous requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  The downside is that the weapon requires burns to be applied pretty consistently, which can be troublesome if players are struggling with AP or the fire runs out too quickly for the rest of the weapon to become useful. Still, simple spell combos like Degagement into Spark can be pretty effective combos that alone will apply double digits worth of burn and quickly make the enemy sizzle to a crisp.

  While her damage output can get pretty absurd, Maelle can also function as a decent tank party member who can sustain serious punishment and use her tools to keep her team alive. Being able to consistently heal the entire team on top of switching to her best stance can be a lifesaver, and the ability to soak up even more damage right from the start can make her incredibly sticky when combined with some defensive Pictos and Luminas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapon even plays off of its own effects, allowing the player to consistently heal and maintain the ability to swap to the Virtuose over and over, all while healing up the team and pumping out some serious damage thanks to her list of aggressive and stylish skills. There are even avenues for a more unconventional build that turns Maelle into a support with spells like Egide, along with several buffs that can make her feel more like a frontline.

  Glaisum is a great choice for players who prefer to use Maelle as a more supportive party member than a full glass cannon. The main benefit comes from the team-wide healing upon switching to Virtuose Stance, and when the weapon is maxed out, the stance also comes with a self-cleanse, which can be incredibly valuable against tougher enemies with sticky status effects like Blight.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapon can be acquired from a boss in Falling Leaves, accessible after unlocking Esquie's swim ability. This means that players can get their hands on Glaisum fairly early into their journey, allowing them to fully unlock Maelle's potential as a support who shakes off everything that comes her way.

  Tissenum is a pretty handy weapon that turns Maelle into a stance-breaking machine, allowing her to build up the meter quickly while staying safe in her defensive stance. Using this weapon with a skill like Fleuret Fury allows players to stun enemies and follow up straight away, thanks to the AP refund.
 </p>
 <p>
  The weapon is found midway through Act 2 as a reward for taking down the boss in Sirene, which means that players will have access to a handy tool like this well before the late-game enemies show up. The combination of Break buildup and reward for Breaking enemies makes it a great choice against any foe that players can reliably stun, whether it be a beefy Nevron or a tough boss battle at the end of the world.

  Gradient attacks are among the most powerful and useful skills in all of
  <em>
   Expedition 33
  </em>
  , and what better way to make use of their power than with a weapon that lets the player generate them twice as fast? Maelle has some of the most ridiculously damaging and high-utility gradient attacks out of everyone on the roster, being able to resurrect the entire team at the click of a button or dish out extreme damage that can practically one-shot any opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level 20 benefit is just incredible, as later on, when bosses are swiping at the team with absurd attack chains, the added benefit of building the gradient meter almost instantly turns tricky situations into cake walks. The defensive stance might not be the best for outputting damage, and that aspect of the weapon leaves a lot to be desired, but it is still well worth choosing to unleash the power of the gradient.

  Sekarum is a particularly interesting weapon that offers a baffling amount of power and utility in specific scenarios, and it is outright broken at times. Throughout the game, the player will encounter plenty of enemies that like to throw up defenses to keep attacks at bay, so the ability to not only shatter any barriers that may arise, as well as pierce straight through them if needed, can make shields that are otherwise frustrating basically irrelevant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, when playing as Maelle, it can be awkward to make use of the Virtuose stance if there are shields in the way, as either the player has to spend AP shooting them down or waste their precious stance on trying to get through. Sekarum removes the problem entirely and lets the player go straight for the throat and make the most of the powerful purple stance.

  Shields are one of the most annoying effects to have to deal with in
  <em>
   Clair Obscur
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  Rather than blocking a percentage, they block the entire attack, so when the player has access to a bunch of shields that can be applied in bulk, they themselves become immovable objects that few enemies can compete with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players reach the later stages of the game, this weapon can be bought from a merchant after defeating him in a grueling battle. But it is well worth the wait, regardless of whether players want to use the shields to soak damage or as a damage buff with skills like Powerful Shield, turning defense into offense in a flash.

  When fire isn't cutting it, electricity can surely get the job done. Clierum is a great choice that greatly benefits the player towards the later stages of the game, where crit chance becomes a guarantee, and they can make the most of the increased damage on certain skills. Maelle doesn't have many innate lightning skills, but has quite a few that use the weapon's element, which turns simple attacks like Sword Ballet into lightning-infused nukes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It may be true that using Virtuose stance can net some of the highest damage numbers for Maelle, but the requirements for the Offensive stance are much easier to come by, which means that the player will have no trouble switching to it on the fly and attacking with a near 100% crit rate to fully unleash the power of the storm.

  If breaking shields wasn't enough, then using them against the enemy sounds pretty good. Barrier Breaker not only looks the part but also has some of the best utility of any weapon in
  <em>
   Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
  </em>
  . There are plenty of occasions where an enemy will have five or even more shields at once, so getting to take all of them away and repurpose them for defense is a massive boon to any build on Maelle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The benefits don't stop at just removing shields, but it even allows the player to switch to Virtuose stance without the need for a specific skill or requirement other than the enemy having a shield. It means that the player can not only add some much-needed defense to their character but also bring some offensive capabilities, all bundled into a single powerful weapon.

  Crits and fire are a perfect pair, and what better weapon to showcase the power of both than Brulerum? With crits that apply burn and built-in critical guarantees, the weapon doesn't seem all that strong on the surface, but it quickly shows off its strength in no time. Each attack holds a lot of power right from the start of the fight, and certain skills like Sword Ballet are effortlessly transformed into single spell powerhouses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being stanceless on Maelle no longer becomes a negative, and with each basic attack, players no longer have to worry about casting high-cost skills or building up specific combos. Instead, they can rely on consistently high damage, all while applying a significant amount of burn with each strike. It's a great weapon choice that keeps things simple and doesn't overdo anything on the flashy side.

  The gear progression of this game is tied to a player's level, meaning that they'll organically find weapons made from different and more improved materials throughout their adventure. Starting with lowly steel and iron weapons before moving on to glass and Daedric weaponry feels great and is a huge part of what makes
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  so special.

 <p>
  Unlike most other RPGs, players don't need to upgrade their weapons over and over again in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . A weapon players find at level 1 can comfortably help them pass through the rest of this 100+ hour epic adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said, the game's variety of weapons is so immense that most players would want to mix and match weapons of the same rarity to see which one is perfect for the character in question. The fact that every weapon is useful in a variety of situations means that players will love it when they get their hands on a Legendary weapon, no matter how rare it may be.

  Just like
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  features weapons that are acquired as players gain levels. However, the game also switches things up with extensive weapon customization and legendary loot that enhances the variety of the game's weapons considerably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting one's hands on a shotgun that doesn't need to reload or a minigun that fires explosive bullets is a rewarding experience that never gets old. By the end of the Sole Survivor's adventures, they'll be kitted out with so many unique weapons that every firefight will serve as a showcase of their impressive arsenal.

  Sure, Geralt may use steel and silver swords in battle for the most part in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  , but that should take nothing away from the impressive array of weaponry in this title. Players can find gear at different levels that help Geralt become stronger, bumping up his DPS against the game's strongest foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rarity tiers ensure that players will love mixing and matching their loadout to see how they can enhance Geralt's effectiveness in combat. From the legendary Aerondight to the swords associated with the witcher schools, there's no shortage of cool swords Geralt can find in battle. If players want more variety, then they can also get their hands on axes, maces, and clubs to switch things up from time to time.

  It's a given that a FromSoftware game will be loaded with a bunch of weapons that players can check out, and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is no exception. This open-world game is a blast to play for a whole host of reasons, with everything from exploration to combat being in a class of its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will love forming their build and seeking out weapons that align perfectly with the build they want to pursue. Dex builds will love the katanas that adhere to their build, while Strength builds will love the many greatswords and axes they can use to flatten their opponents. There are various other builds that players can pursue, with a variety of weapons ensuring that even the most obtuse builds will enjoy a weapon that suits their playstyle.

  A game all about hunting monsters to gather materials and craft stronger weapons,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' progression is tied directly to its gear. Players must make it a point to craft weapons from one of fourteen weapon types, which is already impressive in its own right.

  Each weapon features unique movesets and a series of armaments that slowly but surely help the players become stronger than ever. The immense variety of gear ensures that players will never get tired of the gameplay loop, not when they have so many weapons to experiment with.

  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is an ARPG infamous for featuring so much content that it will boggle a player's mind. The infamous skill tree of this game is a notable mention here, but one can't scoff at the sheer amount of gear that players will find during their journey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looting everything in sight and finding incrementally better gear in every tough dungeon makes for a great time as players kit out their character with the strongest weapons available. The loot of this game can become overwhelming after a point, but players who enjoy what this title brings to the table will love the idea of being rewarded with powerful weapons for taking on challenging bosses and surviving by the skin of their teeth over and over again.

  came hot on the heels of its celebrated predecessor and split fans down the middle. The Junction System, weird plot twist, and underdeveloped characters deserved their criticism, and there's one character who personifies the reception this title enjoys to this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Based on whom players talk to, Squall is either one of the most well-written protagonists of all time or someone way too indifferent for his own good. His design is Nomura at his very peak, and the players who love
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  swear by Squall as an excellent character whose love story with Rinoa more than redeemed this title in their eyes.

  has entered the memesphere in some form or another, with one of the biggest running jokes coming from the sixth mainline entry. During one particular boss fight against the Phantom Train, players were amused to find out that Sabin could suplex this boss without a care in the world... while he's running for dear life on the train tracks!
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a hilarious moment that personifies
  <em>

  's charms and single-handedly turned Sabin into one of the most legendary characters in the franchise. His OP Blitz techniques already made him one of the best monks in the series, but this moment cements his legacy for good.

 <p>
  Despite the fanservice accusations that
  <em>

  is definitely guilty of, the franchise has written its fair share of memorable female characters whom fans love. Yuna is the most obvious mention here, with this brave summoner carving her way into the hearts of fans who fell in love with
  <em>

  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The game tells a surprisingly mature love story, with Yuna slowly growing from a person unsure of her goals into one of the most headstrong and morally infallible characters in the series. It's an amazing transformation that makes her one of the most beloved characters in the series for many fans, making it easy to see why she was the perfect lead for a sequel.

  Aerith has one of the most tragic stories in the game, which is why her optimism is so admirable. Despite being constantly hunted down by Shinra, she never lets despair get to her and tries her hardest to help save the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be impossible to talk about Aerith without mentioning the iconic scene where Sephiroth stabbed her in the Temple of the Ancients. It's one of the most spoiled video game moments of all time that left fans reeling as a permanent party member left, never to return again.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  serves as a perfect combination of old and new, with Vivi being a perfect example of the same. The iconic look of the franchise's Black Mage is used to tell a tragic story where Vivi finds out the truth behind his origins... and his criminally short lifespan.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's something that he finds hard to digest after seeking answers regarding his existence for the longest time, but he swallows this grief and becomes the hero everyone loves, doing everything in his power to save the world, even though he won't be here to witness a happily ever after. It's a genuine tearjerker that has established this iconic Black Mage as one of the best-written
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  characters of all time and a huge reason why people consider
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  to be the greatest title in the series.

  There's no denying that Tifa's character design, being tailor-made for the male gaze, hasn't aged all that well. However, despite this issue, one can't deny that her looks and badassery went a long way in making Tifa one of the most iconic

 <p>
  She's easily the most popular monk in the series, and people love her dynamic with Cloud as the two childhood friends become closer than ever.

  Sephiroth is one of the greatest video game antagonists of all time. His ridiculously long Masamune and his flowing silver hair are iconic, with later iterations of this character adding a wing to his form to literally embody the iconic boss soundtrack that plays during the game's final battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  His rivalry with Cloud is the stuff of legends, with his mysterious appearances and immense power ensuring that he left a lasting impression on players. While his frequent appearances across
  <em>

  and
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  don't sit right with long-time fans, one can understand why they went down this route. After all, everyone knows how legendary this villain is, and making him a central part of these games is only natural.

      <title>Stardew Valley: Cooking Recipes That Are The Hardest To Make</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The mechanics of cooking in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  are very basic. To make any recipe, players simply approach the stove, select the dish they want to make, and the ingredients will be consumed and replaced with the cooked dish. Obtaining the necessary ingredients, though, is what separates the basic recipes from the more complicated ones in this cozy indie farming sim.
 </p>

 <p>
  To cook a Fried Egg, for example, players need only one egg, which are plentiful once they have a Coop. Other meals, however, require hard-to-catch fish or rare foragables, or have recipes that are hard to get. For players who aim to cook every recipe in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , these are the trickiest ones to make.

  Stardew Valley itself isn't a tropical locale, but players can travel to warmer climes once they achieve certain goals. Players can find Coconuts either in Calico Desert or on Ginger Island, but they'll have to get to the latter location before they can cook this dish, since it's where Pineapples become available. Even when they do get their hands on some seeds, these tropical fruits take a long time to grow. Of the ingredients in this recipe, Hot Peppers are the easiest to get, a summer crop that matures quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, players will likely have access to everything they need to make Tropical Curry by the time they get the recipe, because learning to cook this dish takes a lot of legwork. Unlocking the Island Resort costs a total of 50 Golden Walnuts (including the Resort's prerequisites). Thankfully, although the recipe's purchase price might sound high, it's not a big deal for most players by this point in the game.

  Willy isn't too difficult to befriend, but getting any of the game's NPCs to nine friendship hearts will take a while. Luckily, most players will have Milk readily available by the time they do. They should also be able to craft Crab Pots by this point, essential for catching the star of the show — and that's the tricky part.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lobsters have only a base 5% chance to appear in Crab Pots placed in salt water, meaning that players might have to wait weeks before they manage to snag one. Wild Bait can help increase the chances, as can the Mariner profession, which prevents Crab Pots from producing trash.

  For players looking to make this dish, getting the recipe itself is the hard part. Sandy lives way out in Calico Desert, meaning that players will need to repair the bus before they can even meet her. And once they do, they'll have to make the trek out to the desert regularly to give Sandy gifts and chat with her to raise her friendship level high enough so that she'll share her special soup recipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, the ingredients aren't too hard to come by once players do get the recipe. Common Mushrooms are, well, common in Stardew Valley, and Coconuts are all over Calico Desert. The only one that might take some luck is Shrimp, which has a base chance of about 10% to spawn in a saltwater Crab Pot.

  Players can get this recipe pretty early in a playthrough, since it's not too difficult to get Jodi to 3 hearts. However, it will likely be awhile before the farmer can actually cook it. Players can purchase Wheat Flour from Pierre or JojaMart, but if they want to make their own, they'll have to build a Mill first. A Mill requires Cloth, which requires Sheep, which require a fully upgraded Barn to house.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even if players choose to buy flour, the main ingredient still makes this recipe tricky. Squid can only be caught in Winter, between 6 PM and 2 AM on the beach (except during SquidFest, during which they can appear at any time of day). Any

  fishing enthusiast will attest that these tentacled creatures aren't easy to snag, often getting the best of novice fishers. It's always a point of pride the first time a player manages to haul one up without letting it escape.

  Since this recipe becomes available at such a high skill level, it's among the trickier recipes in the game. Still, tomatoes are fairly easy to grow. Wheat Flour, as described above, can have its challenges, but players who haven't built a Mill yet can still buy this ingredient from a few sources.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hard part of this recipe is getting one's hands on some Squid Ink. The most reliable source involves building a Fish Pond, and then catching a Squid to populate it with. However, this can be time-consuming, and Squids are hard to catch. The other way to get this ingredient is to venture to the lower floors of the Mines, where it has a 20% chance to drop from the Squid Kid enemy. The good news is that by the time most players get this recipe, they'll be well-equipped to tackle the challenge of obtaining Squid Ink, no matter which way they go about it.

  Like many of the recipes on this list, part of the barrier for this recipe is how it's obtained. Players only learn to make Seafoam Pudding once they reach Fishing Level 9, and the fishing skill can be one of the hardest to increase.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fish in this recipe aren't particularly hard to catch, but the Midnight Carp can only be found in the Mountain Lake after 10 PM. This creates a fairly narrow window in which it's actually catchable, meaning that most players won't go out of their way to try (except for the sake of fishing or cooking achievements). Squid Ink, as described above, comes with its own set of challenges. Thankfully, at least Flounder are fairly easy to come by, a common catch at the Beach.

  Much like Tom Kha Soup, a lot of the difficulty in this recipe lies with befriending the person who teaches it to players. Leo is a child living by himself on Ginger Island, where he has befriended the local parrots. Traveling to Ginger Island is itself a late-game activity, and getting Leo to seven hearts can take some time and effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coconuts are fairly easy to obtain once the player reaches Ginger Island. Milling homegrown Rice form requires some later-game equipment, as described above, but Rice can also be purchased from Pierre's or JojaMart. Mangoes, though, can take some time to get. Players can purchase a Mango Sapling from the Island Trader, which itself requires a haul of Golden Walnuts to unlock. There's also a chance to find one by breaking open a Golden Coconut, but this depends on luck and chance. Once players do get a sapling, it will still take 28 days before it produces this dish's main ingredient.

  George isn't the easiest villager to befriend, what with his unwelcoming attitude and short list of preferred gifts. But since Spicy Eel is one of the best cooked dishes in the game thanks to its handy buffs, it's worth taking the time to get on George's good side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players do learn the recipe, though, catching an eel is no walk in the park either. Spawning during Spring and Fall after 4 PM on the Beach, players will have to wait for a rainy day before they can try their hand. Even if they get one on the hook, eels have a habit of wriggling out of the player's grasp, much like Squid. Finally catching one feels like a triumph, especially at lower fishing levels.

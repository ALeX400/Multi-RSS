  A fast way to earn more Shamrocks is by participating in ongoing events and tournaments. At the moment, the active solo event is Shamrock Shenanigans, which is running for two days and offers a massive
  <strong>
   3,430 Shamrock Tokens
  </strong>
  if you complete all the milestones.

      <title>Anime Killers That Could Join Dead by Daylight After Ken Kaneki</title>

  With
  <em>
   Tokyo Ghoul
  </em>
  's Ken Kaneki now in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead by Daylight
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the door is wide open for more anime Killers to join the game's roster.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  has thrived from collaborations as much as it has original characters. In that sense, it's little surprise that the developers would eventually reach into the realm of anime. As a result, the pool of characters who can join
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  has expanded dramatically. Anime has introduced fans to plenty of terrifying villains with horrific abilities. Together, they form a whole new world of potential Killers for upcoming
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  chapters.

  The
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  <em>
   Tokyo Ghoul
  </em>
  crossover chapter is currently in the PTB, and will be going live soon. The
  <em>
   Tokyo Ghoul
  </em>
  chapter brings protagonist Ken Kaneki to the game as the latest killer, and he already looks to be an exciting addition to the game. His Kagunes can launch him forward, giving him incredible mobility that few other Killers can match. In addition, the combination of his design and music give him a wholly unique aesthetic that is both cool and spine-chilling. Ken has already proven to be an excellent addition to
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , and an excellent representative for anime Killers.

  Yoshikage Kira Could Be a Strategic Killer in Dead by Daylight
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to killers in anime, Yoshikage Kira from
  <em>
   JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
  </em>
  is one of the first that comes to mind. A serial killer hiding in the town of Morioh, Kira uses his stand Killer Queen not only to kill, but erase evidence of his crimes. In
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , Killer Queen could place traps on objects like pallets or totems, exploding when interacted with. Sheer Heart Attack could also appear as a power, pursuing survivors independently once activated, similar to Nemesis' zombies. Yoshikage Kira would have plenty of tools at his disposal to keep
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Survivors on their toes.
 </p>
 <h3 id="sukuna-immense-power-in-dead-by-daylight-could-be-impressive">
  Sukuna Immense Power in Dead by Daylight Could Be Impressive
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sukuna from
  <em>
   Jujutsu Kaisen
  </em>
  could very well have as many options as Vecna does in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  with his collection of powers. The King of Curses has Cleave and Dismantle as melee and ranged attack options, but that's only the beginning. Spiderweb could temporarily turn parts of the ground into obstacles, providing a vital anti-loop tool. However, Sukuna's greatest potential would lie in his Reverse Cursed Technique power, which could be interpreted to do things such as reversing generator progression or even blocking perk effects. Sukuna could become a big problem for Survivors if he makes the jump to

  Dead by Daylight Could Make Use of Muzan's Demonic Abilities
 </h3>
 <p>
  Muzan Kibutsuji is one of the evilest anime characters in recent memory, outdoing many of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Killers in sheer cruelty. His abilities are something to be feared as well. Muzan's main skill is fighting with whips that he creates from his body, This could not only act as a ranged attack, but let him break pallets and generators from afar too. Additional powers could include using his blood to poison Survivors, or disrupting them from afar with his devastating sonic attack. Muzan's reign of terror in
  <em>
   Demon Slayer
  </em>
  may have ended, but he could be a whole new nightmare in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  These are only three examples of the options now available to
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  . With anime now being an option for future
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  crossovers, Ken Kaneki could very well have company in the future. Both newer anime as well as more classic titles have no shortage of potential killers. Perhaps one day, even a series like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Berserk
  </em>
  will end up crossing over.
  <em>
   Tokyo Ghoul
  </em>
  's Ken Kaneki is
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's first anime killer, and hopefully he won't end up being the last.

  If recent leaks are to be believed,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
   </em>
  </strong>
  remake will be released in April 2025. Rumors have persisted for years that an
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  remake was in the works, but details on the project have been few and far between. Its existence was reinforced by court documents that came to light during Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition, but it still has yet to be officially announced.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  remake has not been announced, reputable leakers have insisted that the game is in the pipeline. The latest leaks have suggested that not only is the game real, but that the
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  remake will be released by the end of June. Even newer claims suggest that fans won't be waiting all that long at all to get their hands on the long-awaited
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  remake.
 </p>
 <p>
  NateTheHate has provided an update on
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  remake. According to their latest information, the plan is to reveal and release the
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  remake in April 2025. "The gap between the reveal and release will be minimal," they claimed on Twitter, adding, "a shadow drop is possible." This is incredibly exciting news for
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  fans, to say the least, so here's hoping that these leaks are accurate and the game will be out next month.

  Oblivion Remake Rumored Release Month
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   April 2025
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There have been all kinds of leaks about Xbox's plans this year.
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
  </em>
  was leaked prior to its official announcement, and leakers have insisted that a
  <em>
   Gears of War Collection
  </em>
  is also releasing this year. Time will tell how much truth there is to these leaks, but the good news is that the latest claim about the
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  remake will be debunked or proven true in just a month's time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If Microsoft is revealing and releasing the
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  remake in April, it's a bit of an unexpected move. After all, Xbox is expected to host a big presentation in June like it does every year, and a huge shadow drop like this would be just the kind of thing to generate buzz.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, past leaks have claimed that the game is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and that its combat is taking some inspiration from Soulslikes. It will be very interesting to see how it looks whenever the reveal happens.

  Building strong staying power in the games industry is no easy task, and

  Preparing For God of War's Next Era

 <p>
  It's currently unclear where
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  will go next after the events of
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  . The finale of the latest chapter saw Kratos and his son Atreus go separate ways, leaving many fans to wonder if they will be leading their own stories. This is quite possible, but until Santa Monica Studio officially states one way or the other, any claims about the next
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  game should be taken with a grain of salt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, there is no new announcement in sight, unfortunately, so as the wait for
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  's successor continues, revisiting the franchise could be a good way to hold one over until it's confirmed. Theories have speculated an Atreus-led spin-off or that Kratos will venture into the Egyptian realm. Such theories have been prevalent in the community for a long time, so it would be a big relief to get either a confirmation or debunking of such claims.
 </p>
 <p>
  The future of
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  may be mysterious at the moment, but 2025 is a huge year for the series. Kratos has maintained a place as one of gaming's most iconic protagonists, and as his story continues to grow, it will be exciting to see where his journey takes him next.

 <p>
  Saber Interactive says that the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  remake is still in development despite its many setbacks. BioWare’s original
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  is still one of the most beloved
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games of all time, and many were excited when a remake was announced for the PS5 back in 2021. Neither EA nor BioWare would be involved with this
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  remake, with longtime
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  port developer Aspyr Media taking the reins.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  remake would since run into several roadblocks, starting with Aspyr reportedly firing the project’s art director and design director after a vertical slice demo failed to meet the expectations of Sony and Lucasfilm in 2022. This resulted in the
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  remake being rebooted from the ground up, and eventually Aspyr was taken off the project altogether. Saber Interactive would set in as a replacement developer, only for parent company Embracer Group to sell the studio along with other subsidiaries last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this upheaval has left many to doubt if the
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  remake will ever be finished, but Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits recently assured everyone that things are still proceeding as planned. In a Twitter post, Willits says that every project Saber is currently working on is still in active development, including the
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  remake and the recently announced
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3
  </em>
  .

 <h2 id="saber-says-kotor-remake-is-still-in-development">
  Saber Says KOTOR Remake Is Still In Development
 </h2>
 <p>
  Willits didn’t give away any details about the
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  remake or any other project in the works at Saber Interactive, but said that more information will be revealed when the studio has “something cool to share.” Last April, Saber CEO Matthew Karch assured worried fans that his company still had the rights to the
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  remake following its split with Embracer Group, and that the development team was focused on exceeding gamers’ expectations.

 <p>
  Those expectations are quite high indeed, given the legendary status of the original
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  . While the
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  remake probably won’t be released anytime soon, fans looking forward to seeing the saga of Revan rendered in modern hardware can at least take comfort in Tim Willits’ recent statement that the game is still in active development. Only time will tell if Saber’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  remake can recreate the magic of the 2003 original, which is still seen as one of the better and more unique
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games ever made.

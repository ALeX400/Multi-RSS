  For years,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed
   </em>
  </strong>
  has set itself apart by offering richly recreated historical settings, filled with characters, locations, and events inspired by real-world history. Recent games have shifted from open-world stealth action to more expansive RPGs, giving players more freedom in combat and dialogue. However, the core of the series has remained constant: transporting players into thrilling, detailed worlds that are worth exploring.

 <p>
  Not all fans have welcomed the shift to a more open-world RPG approach. But regardless, Ubisoft's ambition to broaden the series' appeal has led each installment to expand the depth and scope of its worlds, enhancing immersion and historical recreation. With fans now looking forward to the upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  , here's a look back at the entries that mastered this immersive experience.

  Matching the roaring success of the Ezio Trilogy was a challenging feat, but
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  rose to the occasion. After its launch, the game set a new benchmark for the entire open-world genre. The geme delivered a world of immense scope, multiple playable characters, and notably enhanced features like seamless traversal and fluid combat.

  The setting of the American frontier isn't the most exciting the series has to offer, as the world lacks complex cities and memorable locations. However, the experience of exploring the wilderness as a half-English, half-Mohawk protagonist is truly unmatched in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3.
  </em>
  This adds to the game's immersive aspect and the feeling of playing as a deadly predator.

  was the series' first entry exclusive to new hardware (PS4 and Xbox One), and marked an ambitious leap by recreating Paris' architecture on a 1:1 scale. Though its launch was marred by technical issues, Unity was undeniably ahead of its time. The developers captured the charged atmosphere of revolutionary Paris with an immense sense of scale.

  The original
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  , launched in 2007, was a breakthrough title, introducing a unique and innovative gaming IP. Although it wasn't without its flaws, it was a breath of fresh air. The game takes place in the rarely explored era of the Holy Land during the late 12th century — a time period brought to life with remarkable detail. The closest comparison to its setting is Ridley Scott's film
  <em>
   Kingdom of Heaven
  </em>
  , which also explores themes of conflict and intrigue in the Crusades.

 <p>
  The game's layered narrative, split into two parallel storylines, was unlike anything players had seen before. The game is often critiqued for its lackluster side content, a result of Ubisoft still refining its approach to open-world design. However,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  remains the cornerstone of the franchise. It introduced hallmarks that persist throughout the series today, from atmospheric cities to the dark tone reflective of the historical turmoil of that time.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 2

  was a remarkable leap forward from the original in every department, immersing players in the vibrant landscapes of late 15th-century Italy. The game was enhanced by Jesper Kyd's memorable score and cutting-edge graphics, which made the journey through places like Florence and Venice truly unforgettable.

  set the foundation for the modern direction of the series, taking inspiration from popular action-RPGs like

  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  is collaborating with McDonald's to bring exclusive merchandise to Chinese locations. In the past, other HoYoverse games have partnered with popular food chains around the world, and now it's
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero

  's turn.

 <p>
  Although it's only been a few months since
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  launched, the title has already gained substantial popularity among gamers. Developed by the well-known HoYoverse has contributed to this rise in fame, and fans also appreciate
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  for its story premise, extravagant characters, and adorable Bangboo companions.
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  Version 1.3 will be released on November 6 with new S Rank characters Yanagi and Lighter, as well as new gameplay content and events. In addition to the update, some players will have a chance to get exclusive items thanks to the game's first collaboration with McDonald's.

 <p>
  During the official
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  1.3 Chinese livestream on Bilibili, HoYoverse revealed that the RPG is teaming up with McDonald's in the upcoming months, but the crossover is apparently exclusive to China. While developers have not given further details on the matter, prominent
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  leaker MadCroiX has shared some of the collaboration's exclusive merchandise. Among the items are an Anby Demara pin and a keychain with a Bangboo in a McDonald's uniform with the phrase "Best Friends Forever". The leak also shows what seems to be a large cardboard display of the McDonald's Bangboo. This isn't the first time a HoYoverse game has collaborated with a food chain exclusively in China, as
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's partnership with KFC brought limited Melusine toys to fans from this region.

  In the collaboration's official illustration,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  characters Anby, Nicole, Nekomiya, and Billy are seen eating McDonald's fried chicken and burgers in front of the restaurant. This suggests that the collaboration may involve buying a special meal in order to get the
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  goods. A McDonald's and
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  crossover may be a good choice since the game features similar restaurants and foods within its universe, such as Cheesetopia.

 <p>
  Regardless of its limited availability,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's team-up with McDonald's should be exciting news for players. If the collaboration is popular among fans, HoYoverse might see the potential of bringing it to other countries. Of course, not all the company's international partnerships have gone smoothly, as the recent crossover between McDonald's and
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  faced criticism because of players having trouble redeeming rewards. Hopefully, things will go better for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  and its future collaborations.

 <p>
  Arguably the most innovative and revolutionary aspect of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is the new Omnimovement system. This completely changes the way the player moves in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , as it allows for sprinting, diving, and sliding in every direction — even backwards.

 <p>
  This new system allows for more freedom in terms of movement and survivability. Those who take full advantage of Omnimovement will have the most success. It's extremely effective in all situations, including getting behind cover to avoid death, or even being aggressive when players need to catch an enemy off guard and make them miss by diving or sliding sideways.

 <p>
  Zombies is a hugely popular mode for
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , and it returns to its roots in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . The undead mode has moved away from its classic round-based format in recent
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  games, with
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  turning it into an open-world extraction-based game experience. That said, Treyarch is changing that in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6.
  </em>
  Zombies will officially return to the round-based format that many fans of the mode know and love.

 <p>
  While it's technically not revolutionary since Zombies was originally round-based, the return feels as if it is. The hype that has surrounded the mode ever since Treyarch announced that Zombies would return to the classic format has been substantia. Future
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies modes will think twice about changing the format after
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  On the topic of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies, the mode has been revolutionized with the introduction of Augments. These allow players to customize the Perks in Zombies like never before, giving them minor and major changes. There are over 100 Augments in the game, all of which change the way Perks work. For example, players can alter PHD Flopper so that it activates upon sliding, and make it so that Quick Revive retains the downed player's Perks.
 </p>

 <p>
  It's a revolutionary innovation for Zombies, as there will now be much more variety in the way Perks work. Players could have the exact same Perks, but thanks to Augments, they'll work completely differently. This, on top of the return of Gobblegums, will make for hectic gameplay and customization like never before.

 <p>
  For
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , the devs have decided to bring back the traditional leveling system. Players no longer have to wait for seasonal updates to progress, but they can now reach the highest rank in the game as soon as they start. The classic Prestige is back too, with 10 Prestiges to get through all with 55 Ranks. Once the player reaches the top, they will enter Master Prestige, which has a huge 1000 Levels to power through.

 <p>
  This is yet another traditional system that Treyarch is bringing back from the dead, and the hype around the leveling system makes it feel like a new innovation. It will no doubt revolutionize the way players level up in future games, as the experiment of staggered leveling in recent
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  titles wasn't so popular in the community.

  While it may seem like an obvious innovation,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  will reward players for Prestiging with various rewards, including new Operator and weapon skins. Previously, players would only receive a new icon, Custom Loadout slot, and Prestige Token. This time, the devs are giving fans that and more. Being rewarded with cosmetics for hard work is a great feeling, and, surprisingly, the devs haven't done this in the past.

 <p>
  Players will now have a cosmetic reward that shows off their achievement, as opposed to just resetting their level and stats. It's always fun going through the ranks again, especially for those who enjoy the game, but knowing there's a reward at the end of it only adds to the addictive grind.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , almost every attachment in the game will only benefit the weapon, as Treyarch has decided to cut the cons out. Now, players can freely pick attachments without having to balance out the negative effects. This brings a lot more variety to class setups.
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  allows players to experiment with various attachments and builds but still compete with the meta.

 <p>
  There are still a select few attachments that negatively affect a weapon's stats. However, the majority will only benefit a gun, which is a huge change from the complicated attachment stats that recent titles such as
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  introduced.

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  isn't just revolutionizing multiplayer and Zombies. It's also bringing some massive changes to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  battle royale is getting some huge changes, from the introduction of Ominimovement to a completely new set of guns. That's not all, either. Perks are getting a makeover, there's a new Resurgence map in store called Area 99, and there are plenty of smaller gameplay changes including the removal of backpacks and the return of Satchels.

 <p>
  These changes aim to overhaul the
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  experience, bringing the battle royale more in line with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . The integration is set to begin in Season 1 of
  <em>
   BO6,
  </em>
  so players shouldn't be surprised to see all their loadouts reset once the update comes around.

  There are 10 HUD options for players to use in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6,
  </em>
  all of which change the position of certain display elements. For example, Central Command brings all the HUD elements from the sides of the screen to the middle, while Classic provides a more familiar experience. On top of that, players can customize the shape of the minimap, compass, player names, and more. Zombies players can enjoy a variety of HUD options too, as there are plenty of settings to turn off things like Zombie health bars and damage numbers.

  Enforcer provides the player with a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration after securing a kill. Recon allows players to see enemies through walls for a short time after they respawn, provides a HUD indicator for enemies looking at a player's position, and removes the death skulls when killing enemies. Finally, Strategist gives players a score bonus for objectives and destroying enemy Equipment, as well as allowing players to see Equipment through walls and deploy Tacticals, Lethals, and Field Upgrades faster. These bonuses add yet another layout to a class setup, and so it could appear in future
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles going forward.

  <em>
   Call of Duty

  players have criticized the UI of the game app ever since
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  (2022), with many disliking the horizontal streaming service-style layout. Thankfully, the devs have completely redesigned the UI to provide a better experience for players. Now, with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  app has been reimagined. It features a much simpler layout that all fits on one screen, as well as a vertical menu that is much easier to digest.

      Fortnite may soon collaborate with Disney's Cars, potentially making characters from the propety usable in a non-Battle Royale setting.

     <li>
      Specifically, the leaked crossover may bring Cars characters and tracks to Fortnite's Rocket Racing mode.
     </li>
     <li>
      The collaboration can help boost interest in Rocket Racing by adding depth to vehicle customization, though it remains to be seen if the leak will prove true.

  Disney's
  <em>
   Cars
  </em>
  may be coming to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  sometime soon, according to a leak. There have been plenty of different collaborations that take place in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and affect several game modes, but many of them seem to focus on Battle Royale gameplay. As
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  expands into an experience-based service that houses more than a single game, though, these collaborations may end up extending to parts of the title that could use the extra attention, ensuring that when players get tired of one
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  mode, they can just try out another part of the game and find a similar level of depth.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has been steadily amping up the scale of its collaborations, and the continued partnership the game has with Disney seems to be facilitating recent additions. Most recently, a batch of Disney villains were added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  as a part of the 2024 Fortnitemares event. With the Disney partnership alone, there's a giant library of media to choose from to get gamers hyped, and it appears that a unique pick may lead to crossover that goes beyond outside Battle Royale gameplay being released.

  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  leaker @SamsLeakss claimed on social media that a
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collaboration with Disney and Pixar's
  <em>
   Cars
  </em>
  will be happening soon. @SamsLeakss says that this collaboration is the one they have been asked about most recently. Although there's a chance that this event could also result in Battle Royale skins, it would make more sense for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  to give special attention to its roster of vehicles, since a Porsche and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collab was also leaked recently. If true, these additions would provide an opportunity to take advantage of the newer
  <em>
   Rocket Racing
  </em>
  mode.

  @SamsLeakss also adds that four "Thunder" racing maps will be a part of this event, suggesting that Radiator Springs and Willys Butte will be playable tracks once the collaboration begins. Adding
  <em>
   Cars
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  would make plenty of sense for Epic Games given the previous inclusion of Lightning McQueen in
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  in 2023. This collaboration could be a way to keep players interested in
  <em>
   Rocket Racing
  </em>
  even though it will no longer be getting themed updates.

 <p>
  The list of available car bodies in
  <em>
   Rocket Racing
  </em>
  may come off as somewhat lackluster to gamers who are used to the array of 800+ vehicles in modern racing games like
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  or those who enjoy the many character skins available in other
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  modes. As such, adding
  <em>
   Cars
  </em>
  characters to the lineup could increase the overall interest in one of the newer parts of the game.

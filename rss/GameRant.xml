      <title>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies is a Hit, But Its True Test is Just Around the Corner</title>

 <p>
  The successful launch of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been a breath of fresh air for the longstanding franchise, with the game doing well to meet a lot of the lofty expectations that were being placed on its modes prior to release. Of the Zombies, campaign, and core multiplayer experiences of the title, it was its Zombies mode that arguably had the most work to do, with the mode having gone through a lot of divisive identity changes in recent years.

 <p>
  The two launch Zombies maps of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  have done extremely well to kick things off positively for the mode's latest iteration, offering an early range of enclosed and wide-spanning experiences. While the progression opportunities, Easter eggs, rewards, and maps of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies have worked well to provide an enjoyable start, though, the next steps for Zombies will still be absolutely crucial. While a new map is slated to come to Zombies as a part of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's first in-game season, the pace of the mode's fresh content is expected to slow in the coming months, and Treyarch may need to pull out all the stops to maintain the positive buzz surrounding Zombies during this down-time.

 <p>
  The Zombies experience has grown to become a staple of the wider
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise, particularly the titles that are developed by Treyarch, with the mode first coming to the IP all the way back in 2008 with the release of
  <em>
   World at War
  </em>
  . The tense and varied survival gameplay of Zombies has proved a hit for the franchise ever since, although more recent iterations of the mode have moved away from these traditional mechanics and premises.

 <p>
  For example,
  <em>
   Cold War
  </em>
  introduced the Outbreak Zombies gameplay approach, which did away with round-based experiences in favor of open-world exploration, with this general framework being echoed in more recent releases like
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . This has proven to be quite a divisive change within the Zombies community ever since, with many fans hoping for a return to tradition in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies prior to launch.

 <p>
  Treyarch delivered on these hopes with the two launch Zombies maps for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , Liberty Falls and Terminus, with both experiences reverting to the classic round-based approach while being jam-packed with Easter eggs for players to delve into. While Liberty Falls is a more close-quarters experience, Terminus offers a good blend of exploration while maintaining the claustrophobia of classic Zombies, offering a blend of gameplay that has seen
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies be quite well-received so far. However, maps like these take time to develop, and
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's seasons change after only a few months.

 </h3>
 <p>
  Though the variety is set to continue with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Season 1 Reloaded update, which is slated to add the Citadelle Des Morts map to Zombies, it seems likely that this pace cannot continue based on previous games' post-launch formulas, as a new Zombies map for each in-game season seems like quite a stretch of realistic expectations. This may mean that
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies goes some time before a new map is released following Citadelle Des Morts, and this lull needs to be supplemented with fresh content to keep fans engaged.

 <p>
  While players can still work on researching Augments or completing Easter eggs during this down-time, Treyarch would do well to perhaps add community-wide challenges tied to things like global Zombies eliminations, with rewards coming in the way of unique operator and even Wonder Weapon skins. Limited-time modes akin to the Turned experience of
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  could also be an excellent way to fill this stop-gap, as would small segments of larger maps that function as the Survival areans from TranZit. Hopefully, Treyarch will find ways to keep players engaged with Zombies during the periods where no new map is being released, as it would be disappointing to see the latest iteration of Zombies lose momentum.

  A new rumor making the rounds online suggests that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be announced in December 2024, potentially at The Game Awards on December 12. Considering the dizzying success of Capcom's
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  is an inevitability. It's just a matter of when the game will be revealed to the public.

 <p>
  Recent rumors have suggested that Capcom is gearing up for a
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  reveal. A page for the unannounced game appeared on review aggregate site Metacritic, which helped fuel said rumors. The
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise's near-annual release schedule has also led a lot of fans to assume that the next game in the series will be revealed soon, yet the game still has yet to be announced at the time of this writing.

 <p>
  The latest rumors suggest that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  's reveal could happen at The Game Awards on December 12. This rumor started from a tweet by Lunatic Ignus, who has leaked game industry info in the past. According to their tweet, there is a "huge possibility" that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  will be announced in December. And with reliable insiders pushing back against claims that a PlayStation State of Play will be happening next month, that really leaves The Game Awards on December 12 as the only option for the
  <em>
   RE9
  </em>
  reveal, outside of Capcom deciding to unveil the game as a standalone announcement.

 <p>
  Of course, fans should take the information with a massive grain of salt and keep their expectations in check. It's entirely possible that The Game Awards 2024 will come and go with no mention of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  at all. In fact, the person claiming that the
  <em>

  </em>
  reveal will happen in December pointed out that Capcom is currently focused on promoting
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , which could very well mean that the
  <em>
   RE9
  </em>
  reveal will happen later than expected.

 <p>
  There is other evidence to suggest that a
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  announcement could be happening sooner rather than later, however. Other leakers have claimed that Capcom has already hosted
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  playtests, giving fans the chance to play sections as returning heroes Leon S. Kennedy and Jill Valentine. If the playtest leaks are accurate, it seems that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  will have Leon and Jill investigating an island tied to the origins of the Megamcyete from
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  . Those same leaks claimed that Chris Redfield and Barry Burton will be featured in the game in non-playable capacities. Once
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  is revealed, whenever that may be, fans will know if there was ever any truth to those rumors.

  Players desperate for a follow-up to the award-winning 2014 RPG
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  had to wait a decade for the release of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , which follows the new protagonist Rook as they and their companions attempt to save the world from impending doom. Despite
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  facing review bombings and backlash for its accused DEI content and art style, longtime fans of BioWare's fantasy series have applauded the title for its improved combat mechanics and stunning environments. Now, the team behind
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  is providing a helpful update for PC players.

  A small patch for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  on PC introduces two useful bug fixes, with BioWare promising more updates in the coming weeks. The update fixes a rare issue in which an existing Rook's settings are reset unintentionally after making and saving a new Rook, and also reduces the instances of the game crashing during Shader Compilation at launch. On the game's opening weekend, players flocked to
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  on Steam, pulling in nearly 90,000 concurrent players on Valve's service. This makes it one of EA's biggest single-player launches on the platform.

  The launch has caused other games in the franchise to spike in popularity, with
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  seeing a 66 percent jump in players following the release of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . Additionally, both
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  reached their all-time peak concurrent player counts in June 2024 following the reveal of
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  's first trailer. It's unclear how many players the game has across all platforms, but many believe that these PC numbers bode well for BioWare.

  Unfortunately, the development team has announced that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard

  will have no post-launch DLC. With the last
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  title,
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  , released in 2017, BioWare is starting to work on the next entry in the sci-fi franchise in earnest. Little is known about the untitled fifth game in the franchise, but some recent rumors speculate that it won't be released until 2029. Regardless, BioWare's Michael Gamble has promised that
  <em>
   Mass Effect 5
  </em>
  will feature a photorealistic visual style, unlike the aesthetic found in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   AMD
  </strong>
  has announced that it is laying off 4 percent of its workforce. The semiconductor giant produces processors and graphics cards for gaming PCs and consoles like Xbox and PlayStation, but the chip market has shifted toward AI in recent years. Now, AMD is leaning into that trend as its gaming division struggles to maintain the sales it used to see.

 <p>
  Along with Nvidia, AMD is one of two major chip companies dominating the gaming sector. It's had no shortage of notable product releases in the past year, and in October, AMD announced a new line of CPUs mere weeks after unveiling the baseline Ryzen 9000 series. Despite this activity, it seems the chipmaker's sales aren't what they used to be, leading it to cut a significant portion of its workforce as it rethinks its priorities.

 <p>
  In a statement to CNBC, an unnamed AMD representative described their reasoning behind the layoffs, explaining that they're the result of the company pursuing what it thinks will offer the most opportunity for future growth. Roughly 1,000 workers could lose their jobs as a result, and while the chipmaker didn't specify which teams will see the biggest cuts, its latest earnings call suggests the gaming division may be in danger. While AMD has offered massive price cuts on CPUs and is still a household name in GPUs, its gaming tech sales are expected to fall by 59 percent by the end of 2024.

 <p>
  The "largest growth opportunities" AMD mentioned likely refer to the AI industry. Pivoting to focus on AI is part of why the company's main competitor, Nvidia, has seen such massive success lately. Nvidia unveiled a range of AI GPUs earlier in 2024, and, according to CNBC, accounts for over 80 percent of the AI chip market. That leaves a lot of ground for AMD to cover, especially when its gaming hardware isn't selling enough to make up for it falling behind in the AI space.

 <p>
  While the company has fallen behind Nvidia in this new frontier, AMD has also leaned further and further into AI. Some of its latest processors come with a dedicated AI engine, and many of its newer GPUs feature some AI functionality. More recently, AMD said its FSR4 technology could be fully AI-based, which could challenge Nvidia's ever-popular DLSS upscaling tech. If this recent announcement is anything to go by, though, these efforts haven't been enough to push the company ahead in the new GPU market.

 <p>
  AMD's spokesperson has said the company is committed to treating all impacted employees with respect as the layoff process continues. What exactly that means for these workers is unclear, as is how the chipmaker will direct its resources or manage its gaming division after the job cuts.

      <title>Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.4’s Miyabi Could Be Set to Follow a Genshin Impact Trend</title>

  Powerful beings herald over HoYoverse's fictional worlds, often revered as gods or simply a remarkable group of individuals that have a lot of influence and skill. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the equivalent of this are the Void Hunters, which is a title given to key people for their contributions in suppressing the Hollows around the old city of Eridu. This includes Hoshimi Miyabi, one of the upcoming S-rank Agents in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  Version 1.4.

 <p>
  Miyabi is the Chief of Section 6 and also the youngest person to be named as a Void Hunter because of her power and swordsmanship. As a playable character, she is an Anomaly-type Agent that wields a new Attribute that appears to be a mix of Ice and Fire. This could possibly mean that
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  might be taking a page out of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's book to create a unique experience for Void Hunters.

  Who Are the Void Hunters?
 </h3>
 <p>
  The title of Void Hunter was coined by the mayor of Eridu, and was originally given to seven defenders of the city, who bravely fought against the Hollows before the events of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . It's also said that these heroes lived before Proxies like Phaethon even existed, so there is a high chance that the Void Hunters might either be dead, retired, or missing.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Swordmaster:
   </strong>
   She is the third-generation head of the Hoshimi Family, who took down the Exaltist overseer in the Hollows, and also Miyabi's ancestor.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lady Sunbringer:
   </strong>
   The former CEO of Marcel Group known for eradicating the "Hive Lord" Hollow in the sky of Eridu. She is also the inventor of the beloved Bangboo.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Joyous:
   </strong>
   Known as the "Ace of the Investigation Guild," he created the standard for Hollow exploration routes. It's speculated that he is the predecessor of Hollow Investigators and Proxies.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Col. Vike, Lt. Col. Dan, and leader of Falkenhayn Mercenary Troupe:
   </strong>
   These three worked together to push a dangerous Hollow called the Dark Wall back by 37km.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Professor Arche:
   </strong>
   The founder of Helios Academy and the Helios Research Institute, who discovered the common characteristics of Hollows. It's said that he still hasn't returned from his journey inside Hollow Zero.

  At the present time, Miyabi is possibly the only living Void Hunter in New Eridu, who leads Section 6 in completing high-risk missions within the Hollows. Not much is known about her yet, but

  will likely share more of her lore in Version 1.4.

 <p>
  Just like the Void Hunters,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  also has seven Archons, who are equivalent to gods overseeing each Teyvat region. Because of their status in the game and story, Archons have uniquely powerful abilities that can deal significant damage to enemies and mostly provide support to existing characters. The animation design of their abilities also appears more stylistic compared to other 5-star characters.

  With HoYoverse games intertwining with each other, it wouldn't be surprising to see
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  following in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  when designing the Void Hunters. As mentioned, Miyabi is the first S-rank Agent with a merged Attribute, which could bring more power and variety to fights. This might also mean that the next playable Void Hunter could have the same unique Attributes to really make them stand out from the rest of the roster.

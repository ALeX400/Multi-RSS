  features an array of different perks, each with its own specific uses. Whilst each perk has its own unique effects, perks can be grouped together for certain uses. It’s important that
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight

  players have a good mix of perks, and don’t simply just pick a random selection of the best Killer perks, as they might not even fit their build.

 <p>
  Tracking perks in particular are used by Killers to acquire information on the Survivors and their whereabouts or the progress and status of Generators. These perks are excellent for helping Killers in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  to figure out what their next move should be. Here are some of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's best tracking perks for Killers.

 <p>
  Survivors who slow down at any point in the high-intensity chases of
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  gameplay are guaranteed hooks for the Killer - something
  <strong>
   Forced Hesitation
  </strong>
  almost always assuredly delivers. This Perk will ensure all other Survivors get -20% Hindered for 10 seconds whenever they are within 16 meters of another Survivor who had just been put in a Dying State. Originally slated as part of the Singularity’s toolkit, any Killer can get this Perk in their arsenal if they like to track their prey more efficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it’s true that 16 meters seems “too near” to a Killer for Forced Hesitation to be considered a “tracking” Perk, it’s important to remember that Survivors are oftentimes clustered near each other in relevant locations - especially Generators. A Survivor in a Dying State isn’t always a threat to Killers, especially if this means getting the chance to put yet another Survivor in the same state during their Hindered state. When combined with the likes of Ultimate Weapon, Forced Hesitation ensures Killers can track other Survivors who would dare assist their fallen comrade.

  Chases with M1 Killers can be tough, especially when Survivors know the map well enough to identify excellent hiding spots or vantage points to escape predators. This won’t work with the Xenomorph, however, thanks to its exclusive
  <strong>
   Ultimate Weapon
  </strong>
  Perk. At its core, this Perk will make sure that all Survivors within 32 meters of a Killer will scream once the latter opens a Locker within that same radius.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Ultimate Weapon has a cooldown of 80/70/60 seconds, all activations of Ultimate Weapon will cause all affected Survivors to suffer Blindness for 30 seconds - making it much harder to evade pursuits. Ultimate Weapon is excellent for slow-mobility or small Terror Radii-Killers who need a headstart to catching their targets.

 <p>
  Survivors of
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  gameplay need to fix all Generators in order to activate the Exit Gates and escape the Trial - something Killers need to stop them from doing. And while Generator activation becomes a crucial part of
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  strategy, it will become the Survivors’ downfall with the
  <strong>
   Rancor
  </strong>
  Perk. Originally possessed by the Spirit, Rancor essentially designates a Survivor as an Obsession. When a Generator is completed, the Obsession will see the Killer’s Aura for 5/4/3 seconds, but all Survivors are also revealed to the Killer for 3 seconds. Not only that, powering up Exit Gates will force the Obsession to suffer the Exposed Status Effect permanently, allowing them to be one-hit downed by the Killer on top of a guaranteed one-hit kill.
 </p>
 <p>
  At first glance, the three-second reveal of all Survivors might seem too risky considering a Generator’s activation is required for this to work. However, Rancor works best as an emergency tracking Perk so Killers can still capitalize on a Generator’s activation. This extends to the Exit Gate opening, as the perma-Exposed Obsession will give the Killer a chance for a guaranteed kill throughout the Trial.

 <p>
  Chases are an integral part of
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  gameplay, as they often determine how Survivors try to outplay Killers - usually by vaulting over areas or even bringing down pallets to hinder the Killer’s path. With
  <strong>
   I’m All Ears
  </strong>
  , sudden movements won’t be enough to outrun Killers anymore. Originally exclusive to the Ghost Face, I’m All Ears will now force the Aura of any Survivor performing a Rushed Vault within 48 meters of a Killer to appear for six seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite I’m All Ears having a 60/45/30-second cooldown, the six-second window of the Survivor’s Aura appearing to the Killer can be enough to ensure Killers can activate crucial abilities or be able to outsmart and predict where a Survivor will be heading next - potentially catching them.

  Originally included with the vengeful Onryo, the
  <strong>
   Scourge Hook: Floods of Rage
  </strong>
  is a Hook-based Perk. When activated in a match, four random Hooks transform into Scourge Hooks and are highlighted in white. Should a Survivor in a Scourge Hook become unhooked, the auras of all other Survivors are revealed for 5/6/7 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the short timespan of Floods of Rage’s effect, this effectively transforms Hooks into even deadlier environmental elements. Not only do Survivors take time to get unhooked, but now Floods of Rage will force players saving their comrades to reveal their information to the Killer - practically increasing the odds of exchanging one saved Survivor with another. If a player wants to save their friend, they better be worth the reveal.

  Generators remain the best way for Killers to track Survivors in
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  , especially since they’re a central mechanic in their escape to safety. However, with seven Generators in any given ranked match, it’s a lot to keep track of for only a single Killer. Where does one even begin to look? Thanks to
  <strong>
   Thrilling Tremors
  </strong>
  , the question becomes - where should one not look? The Perk activates as soon as Killers pick up a Survivor, after which the Entity blocks all Generators that other Survivors aren’t currently repairing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Thrilling Tremors has a cooldown of 100/80/60 seconds, this Ghost Face-originating Perk has one extreme upside: all Generators the Entity is blocking is revealed in a white Aura. For the attentive Killer, this means the Generator not highlighted in white is a surefire spot with a Survivor.

  As someone hailing from the
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  franchise, it’s unsurprising for a trapping specialist like the Pig to be on top of all activity that should catch their attention. It’s for this reason that
  <strong>
   Surveillance
  </strong>
  is a Perk created for them - if they can’t watch their victims from cameras all over their “games,” the Entity at least allowed them to see the activity within Generators. When equipped, Surveillance will highlight all regressing Generators with a white aura. This immediately helps Killers spot where all Generators are at all times.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes Surveillance special is its secondary effect: all regression interruptions will highlight the Generator with a yellow aura. This effectively “marks” the Generator as being tinkered by a Survivor, giving away their position. Like in
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  where timing matters in games of life and death, Surveillance will force any Generator repairs to be a matter of speed. Would Survivors repair the Generator in time before the Killer gets there?

 <p>
  Repairing Generators is a central Survivor strategy in
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  gameplay, which is why Survivors often split up into teams - some of which are assigned to clear Generators while others try to bait Killers into chases. If they’re lucky, they can just bait the Killer long enough to open the Exit Gates and run to safety. With the
  <strong>
   Tinkerer
  </strong>
  Perk, the Killer will make sure they still have a last stand against Survivors who think they can get Generators repaired without any inconveniences.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tinkerer basically triggers a Loud Noise Notification whenever a Generator is repaired at 70%, revealing its location. Not only that, the Killer becomes Undetectable for the next 12/14/16 seconds, making it easier for them to jump the gun on Survivors who don’t know where exactly they should run. Considering Tinkerer triggers once per Generator per Trial, Survivors will be at the mercy of an Undetectable Killer at least five times.

 <p>
  The reason why
  <em>
   Dead By Daylight
  </em>
  ’s lore is so terrifying has less to do with it featuring different Killers from across different dimensions, but rather the fact that they all act under the guidance of a benefactor - the Entity within the Fog. The odds are always stacked against the Survivors when the Entity is around, specifically with
  <strong>
   Whispers
  </strong>
  that will have the Entity literally whisper to Killers whenever at least one Survivor is within 48/40/32 meters of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the simple nature of the Perk, Whispers is extremely effective while Killers are scouring areas for Survivors. Unlike other Perks that have specific activation requirements, Whispers simply requires Survivors to be at a certain distance to players. Not only that, Whispers will work even if Survivors are crouch-walking and hiding in lockers - something especially useful when looking for Survivors who prefer just hiding the Trial out instead of actively trying to escape.

 <p>
  Killers scratching their heads while trying to search a large map for Survivors should always remember that the Generator is always a safe bet. They’re important objectives to open Exit Gates, which means a Survivor is for sure trying to repair at least one of them. Thanks to
  <strong>
   Nowhere to Hide
  </strong>
  , this fact becomes a weapon in the Killer’s arsenal. Originally exclusive to the Knight, Nowhere to Hide basically adds a nifty effect whenever Killers damage a Generator: revealing the Auras of all Survivors within 24 meters of them for 3/4/5 seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is perfect for Killers who want to stay on Generator watch instead of active pursuits. A Generator with a repair-in-progress will usually have a Survivor close on standby, so Nowhere to Hide can be quite the effective way of flushing them out in the open.

      <title>LEGO's Game Boy Set is a Bittersweet Reminder of Nintendo's Handheld History</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/nintendo-handheld-history-lego-game-boy-set-reminder/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Over the last few weeks, many gamers have impatiently been waiting for
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  to announce its long-rumored next-gen console, the Switch 2. Although Nintendo has openly stated that the upcoming system will be unveiled sometime before March 31, 2025, its relative silence regarding the console has left some people irritated. To make matters worse, rather than sharing more information about the Switch 2, the company has spent the last several months making all kinds of unconventional announcements instead. It, for instance, recently revealed a $100 alarm clock called the Alarmo, launched an Android/iOS-exclusive streaming service named Nintendo Music, and even provided more details about the Super Nintendo World amusement park that's coming to Universal Epic Universe this year.

 <p>
  Nintendo made yet another non-Switch 2-related announcement earlier this week, this time pertaining to its retro hardware. On January 9, the Japanese game giant confirmed that a LEGO Game Boy block kit was in the works and would be released sometime in October 2025. The reveal of this block kit wasn't that much of a surprise, considering LEGO and Nintendo had worked together to create other sets in the past. The LEGO Game Boy, however, is a tad more noteworthy compared to Nintendo's previous block kits since it's a reminder of an era in gaming history that's long gone: the time when dedicated handhelds were still a big deal.

 <h3 id="nintendo-used-to-release-consoles-designed-exclusively-for-on-the-go-gaming">
  Nintendo Used to Release Consoles Designed Exclusively for On-The-Go Gaming
 </h3>
 <p>
  Back in the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s, Nintendo was manufacturing its own dedicated handhelds. These consoles could only be played on the go and were not attachable to a TV or a monitor via a dock; rather, they were designed exclusively for portable use. One of the earliest products that Nintendo released in this market was the aforementioned Game Boy. This fourth-generation console was launched in 1989 at the modest price of $89.99, and was an unprecedented hit for the company. It flew off store shelves across the world and eventually sold more than 118 million units as of 2016, making it one of the best-selling consoles of all time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The success of the Game Boy encouraged Nintendo to pursue more projects in the handheld market instead of focusing solely on home consoles. In 2001, the company launched the Game Boy Advance, a 32-bit handheld that featured improved hardware capabilities, a smaller form factor, and a more ergonomic design compared to the original Game Boy. Just three years later, Nintendo released a dual-screen console called the Nintendo DS, which had a clamshell design, a touchscreen, and a built-in microphone. Last but certainly not least, it launched the Nintendo 3DS in 2011, a system that was notable for its stereoscopic 3D functionality.
 </p>
 <h3 id="the-switch-is-great-but-it-lacks-some-of-the-charm-that-nintendo-39-s-prior-handhelds-had">
  The Switch is Great, But It Lacks Some of the Charm that Nintendo's Prior Handhelds Had
 </h3>
 <p>
  Of course, Nintendo still makes handheld consoles these days, but its current-gen platform, the Switch, is more of a hybrid device than a portable-only system. The Switch's practical nature and adaptability makes it easy to use in any circumstance; players can play Switch games while lying in bed or experience them in the living room on a big-screen TV. As great as this feature is, one can't help but wonder just how much charm Nintendo hardware lost in its transition from handheld to hybrid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nintendo games on the DS and the Game Boy may have been far more restricted by hardware than they are now, but the consoles' unique aspects gave developers the opportunity to experiment more with their titles. Additionally, many of Nintendo's early handhelds were far smaller and more compact than, say, the Switch or the Steam Deck, which allowed them to be carried in one's pocket. Sadly, because most handhelds are hybrid consoles nowadays, they are usually much larger than the portable Nintendo consoles of the past and are fairly similar to each other in terms of hardware functionality. It's hard to find a modern dual screen handheld or Game Boy-sized console, but Switch-like portable devices are a dime a dozen.

  <strong>
   Vanity Tower
  </strong>
  is a huge structure that is tough to clear. Players running a single-player game will struggle to complete this location in a single day. Like all entries on this list, Vanity Tower is a late-game POI, so players should avoid heading here until they have enough ammo, weapons, armor, and meds to clear it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even then, this place is a real challenge.
  <strong>
   There are lots of weak floors that collapse when used, zombies hide around every corner, and more
  </strong>
  . Vanity Tower should not be taken lightly.

  <strong>
   Higashi Pharmaceutical
  </strong>
  is a great place to visit for those wanting to learn more about the lore of
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  . The developers are very good at telling a story without uttering a single word. This POI gives players an insight into some of the horrendous testing that went on in this building, and how it affected the state of the game's world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a huge structure and can take a few in-game days to clear.
  <strong>
   Each floor is filled to the brim with the most dangerous enemies in the game.
  </strong>
  Players can expect to take on seemingly endless hordes of Wights, Mutants, and other hard-hitting enemies while making their way through this location.

  At first glance,
  <strong>
   Dr. Karen Higashi Residence
  </strong>
  looks like a nice, comfortable, modern home. However, it's hiding a dark secret below. Underneath this residence is a huge bunker that was used to conduct a whole manner of experiments involving the virus. In fact, if the player has visited Higashi Pharmaceutical (featured above), then they'll have a fairly good idea of what to expect beneath this seemingly normal home.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   While it's not as large as many of the other entries on this list, it packs lots of tough zombies into a confined space, making it a very dangerous and difficult place to clear.
  </strong>
  Since most of the core structure is underground, it's easy to get stuck and overrun by enemies, as there are only a couple of escape routes that players can use.

  <strong>
   U.S. Army Post #7
  </strong>
  is seen by many as the most difficult location to clear in
  <em>
   7 Days To Die.
  </em>
  <strong>
   All of the tents around the main building contain more than a handful of unpleasant occupants.
  </strong>
  However, the most dangerous part of this place is the basement. Once the player enters, countless enemies will spring into action. While the main building isn't particularly big, it is packed full of Military Zombies, Cops, Mutants, and more. Players may want to lower their difficulty setting prior to taking this place on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who are feeling brave enough to attempt clearing this POI should bring lots of bullets and even more meds, as this is truly a challenging location. That said, the rewards are more than worth it. On top of its loot room, there are lots of consoles, chairs, and more that players can break down with a wrench for lots of useful resources.

  <strong>
   However, this place is a lot harder than many first-time players might believe.
  </strong>
  It's all too easy to get overrun and cornered by a group of zombies while trying to clear this location.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, its main loot room isn't as good as most of the other entries on this list. That said, for those looking for a challenge who aren't too fussed about grabbing lots of loot, Two-Bit Tower might be just the place to visit.

  Explosives, traps, and lots of undead enemies, this place is not for beginners. The first thing players will see upon approaching this location is a huge sign with the words 'Restricted Area' written on it. This place is a weapon research and storage facility, and it is among the most dangerous places to clear in the whole game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Red Mesa Compound
  </strong>
  is made up of many long underground tunnels. It's very easy to get lost in this place. Not only that, but there are hordes of enemies waiting around every corner.
  <strong>
   However, the loot available for clearing this POI is really good,
  </strong>
  but the sheer number of enemies that lie within this compound makes it a nightmare to clear.

  Prior to the outbreak,

   Dishong Tower
  </strong>
  would have been a nice place to visit. It's filled with businesses, and amenities like a gym, a bar, a restaurant, and more. Unfortunately,
  <strong>
   this place has undergone some rather dangerous changes since the outbreak.
  </strong>
  Its former occupants have been turned into rather unpleasant guests. To clear this place, the player will need to turn up well-armed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only that, but they'll also need to have a good sense of direction as it is very easy to get turned around in the building's winding corridors while trying to get to the loot room on the top floor.

  might just be the location with the most zombies per square inch. This rather modest-sized building is overflowing with enemies. While the whole building is hard to clear, the main theater and stage are where most of the enemies can be found.

  The rows of seats make the room rather tricky to navigate, especially while being chased by dozens of undead enemies.
  <strong>
   Many players opt to craft a block tower up to the roof and take the building from the top down, as it makes clearing this location a little easier.

      <title>Every Leak and Rumor About Honkai: Star Rail's Anaxa So Far</title>

  Prior to the release of Amphoreus in Version 3.0,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  had already revealed eight new characters from this planet, who are inspired by various figures in Greek mythology. One of them is Anaxa, who's said to be a scholar who inquires about the prophecy of the gods. He is also a rumored playable character in a future

  Anaxa is part of the Chrysos Heirs, a group of heroes tasked with plucking the Titans' Coreflames and saving Amphoreus from ruin. The full details about Anaxa are still under wraps, but there are already leaks hinting at what the

  Rumored Release Date
 </h3>
 <p>
  So far, three Chrysos Heirs have been revealed to be playable in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  : Aglaea, who's launching in Version 3.0, Mydei and Tribbie, who are both debuting in Version 3.1. According to leaks,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.2 will feature Anaxa and Castorice as the 5-star banner characters.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Aglaea (Version 3.0):
   </strong>
   Lightning, Path of Remembrance
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mydei (Version 3.1):
   </strong>
   Imaginary, Path of Destruction
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Tribbie (Version 3.1):
   </strong>
   Quantum, Path of Harmony
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Anaxa (rumored to release in Version 3.2):
   </strong>
   Ice, Path of Nihility
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Castorice (rumored to release in Version 3.2):
   </strong>
   Quantum, Path of Remembrance
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The information has not been confirmed by HoYoverse yet, so the banner rumor is still subject to change. Likewise,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.2 is estimated to be released on March 12, 2025.
 </p>
 <h3 id="rumored-ability-kit">
  Rumored Ability Kit
 </h3>
 <p>
  Anaxa is said to be an Ice-type Nihility character, which means that his abilities can apply DoT (damage over time) effects and/or debuffs onto enemies. His Ice abilities can also freeze enemies during combat. Likewise, Anaxa could join the likes of other Ice-type
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  characters, like Herta, Jingliu, and fellow Nihility unit, Pela.
 </p>
 <p>
  One report from leaker Shiroha claimed that Anaxa's Ultimate ability could delay the actions of enemies and apply a random weakness onto them. If the information is reliable, this ability is quite similar to Silver Wolf's kit, which could make him a good fit in Nihility teams in the future. He might be especially important for compositions that might need damage dealers and/or debuffers that could make Weakness Breaks against powerful enemies much easier.
 </p>
 <h3 id="possible-backstory">
  Possible Backstory
 </h3>
 <p>
  Prominent
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  leaker Seele Leaks reported that Anaxa's Coreflame is said to either be Wisdom or Reason. This makes sense considering that Anaxa is a scholar, and the origin of his name comes from the Greek philosopher named Anaxagoras. Although many of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Amphoreus characters were based on gods and deities from Greek myth, Anaxagoras is actually a real philosopher who claimed that "nous" (the intellect or mind) was the motive cause of the cosmos.

 <p>
  Additionally, Anaxa's Divine Authority is said to be Cerces, who is one of the Three Titans of Creation and holds the Coreflame of Reason. According to
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's blog, titled "Amphoreus and the Mysterious Titans," Cerces is said to have manifested Amphoreus as "a great sacred tree." Cerces is also known as the Reason Titan, and they allowed humans to achieve enlightenment and reflect deeply to gain knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  ​​​​​​​
 </p>
 <p>
  Amphoreus' 12 Titans are key figures in the history of the planet, and it's been hinted that the Astral Express Crew will encounter their remnants, along with their followers, during their journey. It will be interesting to see the roles that Anaxa and the rest of the Chrysos Heirs will play in helping Trailblazer and the gang during this exciting new chapter.

  A recent leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  is hinting at a brand-new game mode set to come to the urban action RPG during its Version 1.5 update. The newest game from HoYoverse has already given fans plenty to do within New Eridu, with a variety of different game modes testing players' combat prowess and team-building. From roguelike challenges in Hollow Zero and the recent "Lost Void" expansion to the imposing combat challenges of "Shiyu Defense" and "Deadly Assault," HoYoverse has offered a wide range of game modes. Now, another may be on the way soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's Version 1.3 update saw the introduction of one of the game's newest endgame combat challenges with the "Simulated Battle Tower." Within the game mode, players are tasked with battling a gauntlet-style challenge of increasingly powerful enemies using limited team setups. Players can only change out their teams after completing five consecutive stages of the game mode, with characters not recovering their HP between battles and using a restricted number of characters. The Simulated Battle Tower may now be getting a brand-new expansion in the game's next update.

  Zenless Zone Zero Leak Hints at New Game Mode
 </h2>
 <p>
  A new leak shared by prominent HoYoverse leaker Palito is teasing the addition of a new "tower" game mode in Version 1.5. According to the leak, the Tower will boast a staggering 200 floors filled with powerful enemies for players to challenge, with enemies after Floor 50 receiving the "Demonized" buff. The later floors of the Tower will also feature enemies steadily gaining more HP, ATK, and Anomaly buildup. The leak even hints at a potential seasonal rotation for the new "tower" mode, teasing a "Season 2" of the
  <em>

  game mode.

  The newest endgame challenge within
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  comes as the urban action RPG has increasingly put the focus on powerful endgame enemies. Alongside the previously-mentioned Simulated Battle Tower, Version 1.4 introduced "Deadly Assault" as a rotating game mode focused on dealing high damage to powerful enemies. The game mode tasks players with building individual teams to fight three different powered-up bosses, with characters not able to overlap between teams.
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's new "tower" game mode is expected to launch with Version 1.5 on January 22.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside the newest game mode, Version 1.5 looks to be bringing a plethora of new content to the table for
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  fans. HoYoverse will add two new S-Rank characters to the game during the update, with both Astra Yao and Evelyn Chevalier joining the playable roster. The update will also introduce the game's first rerun banners alongside the release of an Agent Story for Version 1.0 S-Rank character Ellen. HoYoverse is looking to keep
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's early momentum rolling with another major update coming soon.

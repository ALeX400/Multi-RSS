 <p>
  FromSoftware has always had a very passionate fanbase, even from its earliest days with games like
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Armored Core
  </em>
  . But FromSoft's passionate fanbase grew exponentially with the release of
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  and its beloved successor,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . Fans knew they were experiencing the start of something special with these games, and that feeling only grew with each subsequent FromSoftware entry, eventually leading fans to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  , a game that's now sold over 20 million copies and captured the largest playerbase in FromSoft's lengthy history.

 <p>
  Over the last two years, the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community has remained strong, checking in now and then when new updates have dropped or whenever they get the itch to explore the Lands Between just one more time. And while
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's fanbase has plenty of external channels of communication like Reddit and various Wikis, there's nowhere better to communicate with other fans than in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  itself, and the game's social messaging system enables exactly that, a system that Shadow of the Erdtree continues to embrace.

 <p>
  Introduced all the way back in 2009's
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  , FromSoftware's trademark social messaging system allows players to leave a note on the ground for other online players to encounter and read. In the original iterations of this system, players only had a handful of key phrases they could use, which led to some incredibly creative, and now iconic phrases. Even in its very earliest iterations, FromSoftware's messaging system was used by passionate fans to try and help one another discover secrets, or to give hints as to where to go next or what strategies are viable against certain enemies.

 <p>
  With far more phrases at the player's disposal now,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is filled with positive and helpful messages, guiding players to hidden areas, warning them of ambushes, and pointing them toward useful items. Within just its first hour of going live,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC was filled with these messages, and at a time when the go-to Wikis haven't had a chance to add new information yet, these messages were actually quite helpful.
 </p>

 <h3 id="shadow-of-the-erdtree-39-s-messages-remind-players-to-have-fun">
  Shadow of the Erdtree's Messages Remind Players to Have Fun
 </h3>
 <p>
  But, of course, anyone who's ever played a FromSoftware game knows the true purpose behind the social messaging system. While helpful messages are definitely a common occurrence in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , it's far more common to see messages designed to troll the player, or messages that relate to various inside jokes the community has had over the years. For instance, booting up
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC right now will undoubtedly see players encounter a handful of messages containing pieced-together innuendo, some notes claiming that a turtle is a dog, and another few that simply say "fort night," or something similar.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1069} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Though it can get a little tedious to see the same jokes repeated time and time again when players are hoping to see a useful note, their purpose is actually much greater than fans might realize.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and especially its recent Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, is quite a dark game tonally, and these jokey
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  social messages do a great job of relieving the tension and keeping things lighthearted, reminding players that this journey isn't actually a lonely one.

  New information about
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been uncovered, revealing that Blizzard's action RPG will add new Unique items in Season 5. This week,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  opened the test server once again, and with the return of the Public Test Realm (PTR), players are starting to dig into the new features coming to the game.

 <p>
  There are five rarities of items in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , with the common items being the lowest tier, and the Unique items being the highest tier.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Unique items are coveted not only for their rarity but also because they give players a great boost with their attributes, affixes, effects, and appearance that stand out from the rest. With Season 5 getting gradually closer, exciting information has been revealed about
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's iconic Unique items.

 <p>
  Wowhead has revealed that
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  will introduce 15 new Unique items in Season 5. The information comes straight from the PTR and confirms the addition of five general Uniques, which are Unique items for every
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  class, these being the Crown of Lucian (helmet), Endurant Faith (gloves), Locran's Talisman (amulet), Rakanoth'a Wake (boots), and Shard of Verathiel (sword). Among the main attributes that the items will give to
  <em>
   Diablo 4 players
  </em>
  , the new helmet stands out for its impressive 1,156 armor, the new gloves and boots grant 463 armor, the new amulet has 25% additional elemental resistance, with the new sword causing a whopping 1,838 damage per second.

  But changes don't stop there since
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  Season 5 PTR has made tweaks to help players grab their desired Unique items. Unique and Mythic Unique items can now be obtained through Whisper Caches, Purveyor of Curiosities, and Tortured Gifts in Helltide. Blizzard also notes that these new Unique items can be obtained by slaying monsters in Sanctuary, but the best chance of getting them will be by playing Infernal Hordes,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's new endgame mode.

      <title>15 Xbox Games That Are Like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</title>

  Exclusivity is the pet peeve of many gamers. Not only does it prevent players from enjoying some of the most critically acclaimed single-player franchises of all time, like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , but it can also cause them to miss out on multiplayer fun with friends if they own different systems. Unfortunately, exclusive titles don't seem to be dying out, and they will likely continue to be a prominent feature of the ninth generation of home consoles.

  However, one of the great things about the gaming industry today is that the enormous amount of games released yearly provides players with many alternative options to exclusive titles.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one example of a game that was released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch to the envy of many gamers. Thankfully though, there are tons of
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Mario
   </em>
   on Xbox
  </strong>
  that offer similarly enjoyable platforming experiences for fans of Microsoft's home console.

  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury is one of the best platforming games of all time, and it's a shame that people without a Switch can't check this masterpiece out for themselves. Still, players with an Xbox console can still enjoy numerous platformers that do a great job of eliciting a lot of what made this updated release such a blast to play through. If gamers are unable to control the beloved Italian plumber on their console, then some of the best
   <strong>
    games like Mario on Xbox
   </strong>
   should quench their thirst.

   <em>
    It Takes Two
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a delectable co-op adventure where a huge chunk of the gameplay involves players using tight platforming mechanics to explore the many levels present in the game. By switching the tools players have at their disposal numerous times to keep things fresh, the game makes up for a rather lackluster narrative and is certain to keep gamers enraptured until the very end.

  People who loved the varied powers present in
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury

  will find this title's shifting gameplay systems to be a perfect fit. Players must compete both with and against each other in mini-games to make for an entertaining time that further establishes this title as one of the best co-op games ever made.

  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  was created by Naughty Dog as Sony's answer to Nintendo's
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  and Sega's
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  . Although the orange marsupial never quite reached the heights of the Italian plumber, he still became an iconic character and featured in one of the best platforming trilogies of all time on the PlayStation 1.

   <em>

   <strong>
    Sonic Frontiers
   </strong>
  </em>
  was released in November 2022 and saw the
  <em>
   Sonic The Hedgehog
  </em>
  franchise join the open-world trend with its wide open zones that players were free to explore. The mix of open zones and platforming could have been a hot mess, but most
  <em>

  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  certainly isn't the most challenging platformer in the world, but it manages to remain interesting for more experienced players with its collectathon elements. To complete the game 100%, players need to complete multiple objectives in each level, such as collecting 300 coins and solving a hidden puzzle. As long as players aren't into the more challenging levels of
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury
  </em>
  , they'll love what
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  brings to the table.

  From one of the Xbox's most laid-back platformers to one of its most intense,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Celeste
   </strong>
  </em>
  was released at the start of 2018 and quickly drew comparisons to
  <em>
   Super Meat Boy
  </em>
  for its punishing but rewarding difficulty. Beating
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  normally provides a tough platforming challenge, though it only tells part of the story. Completing the game 100% is one of modern gaming's hardest tasks, as players need to collect difficult-to-reach strawberries, complete tricky B-side tapes, find the well-hidden Crystal Hearts, and much more.

   Celeste
  </em>
  's difficulty is far from just a gimmick, as it ties into the game's touching story. It may lack the freeform movement of
  <em>

  , but the tight movement mechanics and high challenge of
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  make it perfect for fans who want to check out
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Mario
   </em>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time

  was released in October 2020 with a large weight of expectations on its shoulders from the marsupial's loyal fan base, who had waited many years for a new platform game in the series.

 <p>
  Thankfully, the game didn't disappoint, as it provided players with one of Crash's best adventures yet. Much like
  <em>
   Celeste,
  </em>
  beating the game normally is challenging enough, yet the difficulty still manages to crank up far higher when attempting to complete it 100%. When it comes to checking out
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Mario
   </em>
   on Xbox

  <em>

  couldn't be a better fit.

  Another classic platformer that delighted fans with a grand return is
  <em>
   <strong>
    Psychonauts
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  The original
  <em>
   Psychonauts
  </em>
  was published by Majesco Sales and differentiated itself from other platformers with its emphasis on psychic themes.

  Not only does the story revolve around a summer camp of gifted psychic children, but the playable character, Razputin, has multiple abilities that players can utilize. Raz's psychic powers through the game include invisibility, telekinesis, and levitation. Players who loved using the many unique powerups in
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  will find Razputin's varied moveset in
  <em>
   Psychonauts
  </em>
  to be a great fit.

  <em>
   <strong>
    A Hat in Time
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of gaming's many crowd-funding success stories. The game was advertised on Kickstarter, where it smashed its $30,000 goal with an eye-watering $296,360 pledged. Although the game doesn't reach the heights of some of the platforming genre's top titles, it was still well-received by both fans and critics.

 <p>
  As for the game itself,
  <em>
   A Hat In Time
  </em>
  takes inspiration from classic collectathon titles like
  <em>
   Banjo-Kazooie.
  </em>
  The game makes great use of the money pledged, with its visually impressive and well-designed open levels for players to explore. It's one of the more charming
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Mario
   </em>
   on Xbox
  </strong>
  players can check out.

  The Metroidvania genre has had a fairly impressive resurgence in recent years, with games like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Guacamelee 2!
  </em>
  revitalizing the style. Another title that has helped recapture the Metroidvania magic is
  <em>

    Ori and the Will of the Wisps

   .

 <p>
  The game has beautiful, nature-inspired visuals, just like its predecessor.
  <em>
   Will of the Wisps
  </em>
  expands upon its predecessor with its enormous map that is a delight to explore and has numerous side quests for players to complete. It may feature more combat than the average
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game, but it's still a great recommendation for fans of
  <em>
   3D World

  Much like the aforementioned
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy,
  </em>
  2018's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Spyro The Dragon
   </strong>
  </em>
  was a well-received remake of a beloved PlayStation 1 trilogy. The game provides great value for money, as all three games have fantastic collectathon levels that take a good chunk of time to complete 100%.

 <p>
  The release of
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About
  </em>
  <em>
   Time
  </em>
  has unsurprisingly got fans of the purple dragon excited that the franchise will also be receiving a new entry. Although nothing has been confirmed, it does seem as though a new
  <em>
   Spyro
  </em>
  game could be in the works, as
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot 4
  </em>
  has a hidden Easter egg that appears to tease
  <em>
   Spyro 4
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  This character may not be as popular as
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  , but fans of Nintendo's platforming mascot will find a lot to love about
  <em>
   Spyro Reignited Trilogy
  </em>
  .

  Much like
  <em>
   A Hat In Time,
  </em>
  the
  <em>
   Yooka-Laylee
  </em>
  franchise began life as a highly anticipated crowd-funding project. However, Playtonic Games'
  <em>
   Yooka-Laylee
  </em>
  wasn't as well-received when it initially hit stores, with criticisms of its level design being rampant. Many people thought that the poor reception would mark the end of the franchise, though a new game was released just a couple of years later.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair
   </strong>
  </em>
  came out in October 2019 and was far better received than its predecessor. The game took a change of direction, ditching its
  <em>
   Banjo-Kazooie
  </em>
  influences in favor of side-scrolling
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country-
  </em>
  like platforming. It may be more difficult than the average
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  level, but fans who love a challenge can have a great time playing through
  <em>
   The Impossible Lair
  </em>
  .

  Rare's classic platformer,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Banjo-Kazooie
   </em>
  </strong>
  , is one of the most influential collectathons of all time. The game differentiated itself from the majority of platformers at the time of its release with its comparatively huge levels that were filled to the brim with things to do and collect.

  Despite releasing all the way back in 1998, players don't need to worry too much about how to play the game today, as it's available on Microsoft's Game Pass service. It's an easy recommendation for fans seeking out

  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  has always held a fairly odd place in the platforming genre. Despite the limbless hero featuring in some of the most critically acclaimed games in the genre's history, he is often forgotten when the best franchises are mentioned, and Ubisoft seem to see
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  as secondary to their action and adventure games. Hopes of Ubisoft giving their platforming hero a new adventure in the near future appear to be slim, but thankfully, there are numerous excellent
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  titles already out there to keep fans busy.

 <p>
  Although the first two
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  games are classics,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Rayman Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the best pick to play today. The game has some of the most well-designed platforming stages in the genre's side-scrolling history, with plenty of secrets hidden within. Players who are seeking out the same level of quality as seen in Nintendo's flagship series will find
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  to be right up their alley.

      The Spiritcaller Snail in Road's End Catacombs offers a challenging balance between defeating spirits and dodging attacks.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  has countless bosses that players must face not only to progress the main story, but also plenty of optional bosses for players that are wishing to gain experience or various weaponry to use while progressing
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . While many players have their favorite bosses or those they find to be incredibly difficult, there are plenty of underrated bosses that many Elden Lords tend to gloss over or forget about during their playthrough.

 <p>
  While the likes of the Elden Beast or the battle against Malenia may not be seen here, there are plenty of other incredible bosses that deserve some extra love and attention from those that are on their quest to become the Elden Lord and may even have a little more respect for these epic enemies when they meet them next.

  Players are likely to encounter multiple Giant Miranda Sprouts as regular enemies throughout their adventure in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , though Miranda The Blighted Bloom is the only time players will encounter this enemy by itself and, while it may not be the most glorious battle in the game, players are left to take on this oversize plant in a small room of the Tombsward Cave.

 <p>
  Players may find themselves having a surprisingly hard time dealing with this Miranda Sprout, as Miranda The Blighted Bloom, and her small Miranda Sprout allies fill the entire room with poison that risks killing the player quickly. Therefore, players will need to stock up on Neutralizing Boluses or find a way to kill her quickly enough to not die of the poison first.

  Like Miranda The Blighted Bloom, the Spiritcaller Snail is a regular enemy that players may face as a boss occasionally in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . While this may cause many players to forget them by the end of their adventure, players are still fondly reminded of the underrated boss battle the first time they likely encounter the Spiritcaller Snail in the Road's End Catacombs or Spiritcaller Cave.

 <p>
  Players will need to search around the boss room to find the actual boss snail, while the Spiritcaller snail continues to throw some of the deadliest spirits at the player to defeat. Balancing between the spirit and the snail can be quite a challenge, especially as the Spiritcaller snail will teleport around the room to save itself.

  Players are likely to encounter all sorts of wondrous bosses during their adventures in Elden Ring, with many of them being not only large but also incredibly lethal. The Ulcerated Tree Spirit is one of many bosses that players will encounter multiple times in Elden Ring.

 <p>
  Due to how often the Ulcerated Tree Spirit is seen both in and out of boss locations, many players hoping to become the Elden Lord have forgotten the intense nature of taking on an Ulcerated Tree Spirit as it recklessly throws itself around its boss room, which makes it look like it's impossible to get a hit on the spirit, not to mention the holy damage it also has available.

  Dragonkin Soldiers aren't only interesting bosses due to their collection of moves that see them eradicate players with various lighting and ice abilities, but also for their incredible lore that gives players a warning of what they could become from using too many dragon abilities.

 <p>
  The Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella is a prime example of an underrated boss, with the battle taking place not only in an incredible location within the Ainsel River but also likely the first time a player has come face-to-face with a disfigured person who appears to be changing into a dragon, while the player will never see that truly happen to their character, it's still unnerving and something to be remembered.

  The Ancestor Spirit may be a favorite boss for many players, but it's still arguably one of the most underrated bosses in
  <em>
   Elden Ring.
  </em>
  Countless players are likely to have completely missed both Ancestor Spirit boss fights if a player never decided to light every brazier within the Siofra River.

  When fighting the Ancestor Spirit, players will first notice the incredibly calming music that plays in the background of an intense battle. Not to mention the beauty that is the Ancestor Spirit that makes every attempt at defeating this legendary deer-like creature feel like something that needs to be remembered.

  Continuing on the theme of underrated bosses with incredible battle locations, the Godskin Apostle is not only a challenge for most players but also a location that sees players almost falling to their deaths from the Dominula Windmill Village as the Godskin Apostle pushes the player closer to the edge.

 <p>
  The location and the lead-up to the Godskin Apostle is only one part of why this boss is so underrated, as the agile humanoid creature that dresses itself in the skin of the gods, isn't entirely a person as its body stretches unnaturally to attack the player.

  Many of the underrated bosses of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are those that can be found on the field while exploring the entirety of the map. Tibia Mariners are one of many of this boss type that can be found rowing their boats surrounded by the dead. Even if players are only killing these bosses for the Deathroot they provide, each Tibia Mariner encounter includes managing various undead that he raises while also chasing the boatman.

 <p>
  Unlike other bosses that have actual weaponry, this underrated boss attacks the player through its magic from its horn as well as slamming the boat into anyone that gets too close, making for an interesting encounter every time.

  Out of all the underrated bosses of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , one of the best for players to fight but is always forgotten is the Full-grown Fallingstar Beast. This four-legged bull creature with a bug-like head is more than just an animal, as it has the capability of using various gravity-themed spells.

 <p>
  This causes players to have to dodge out of the way of its charging attacks, while also keeping clear of its gravity ray abilities too. The Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast feels so different from any other boss in the game that makes this Fallingstar Beast a boss any player should test themselves against.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan and YouTuber has put a bounty out for a specific cutscene where Karlach seems to become aware of the fact she exists in a video game. The unique
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  cutscene took players by surprise back when it was first discovered, but there is still an issue that remains after all this time.

 <p>
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  took the world by storm when it released, quickly racking up sales and industry awards. The title's attention to detail is just one element that helped to propel the game to such success. However, one odd moment that can transpire involves Karlach seemingly becoming sentient outside the scope of the game, and now one player is trying to resolve how it's triggered.

  player and YouTuber Proxy Gate Tactician has put out a $500 bounty for anyone who can figure out how to trigger this particular cutscene with Karlach without using mods. Previously, it was believed that this scene was some kind of cut content that would be completely inaccessible without altering the game's files. However, Karlach's performer, Samantha Beart, suggested otherwise, claiming that she would talk about the discovery in more detail once someone figured out how to trigger it organically, rather than modding the game.

  Enter Proxy Gate Tactician, who is still seeking the answer on just how to do that. PGT points out that numerous players have claimed that they've encountered this cutscene during their own vanilla playthroughs of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , but no one has provided evidence of that actually transpiring. Data miners exploring
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  previously discovered evidence that the cutscene can't be triggered in-game at all without modifying the game. As a result, PGT is convinced that it doesn't actually exist in vanilla gameplay, but would like to be wrong, putting out a $500 bounty for anyone who can prove that it's accessible and how they did it.

 <p>
  Anyone who is interested in taking on the challenge should note that they only have until September to do so, when patch 7 releases for
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . All a player needs to do is to record the cutscene and how they accessed it in a video, upload it to YouTube, alert Proxy Gate Tactician with a message on the challenge video, and providing they're the first person to do so, the bounty will be awarded to them.

  Of course, there's a good chance that this challenge is futile, as PGT seems to think. The fourth wall-breaking cutscene with Karlach is extremely odd, and it's possible that the associated content Beart was referring to was axed or made inaccessible at some point in the game's development. Assuming no one comes forward with a solution, it's possible that more information will be discovered on how this scene was intended to be used in the future by dataminers. But for now, it largely remains a curious mystery.

  The first Explorer Challenge is the only true unique one of the set, as it will require players to find a Treasure Map. There are plenty of ways to find a Treasure Map in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , and we have listed several of them that are accessible from Chapter 2 onwards:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Jack Hall Gang Map – Acquired from Maximo in the All That Glitters Stranger mission. Maximo can be found West of Flatneck Station in the Heartlands, New Hanover, and players can rob him or purchase the treasure map from him. Failing to do so will see the Jack Hall Treasure Map available at a local Fence.
  </li>
  <li>
   High Stakes Treasure Map – Found through a random encounter with an elderly man atop a cliff by Lenora View, North of Strawberry in West Elizabeth. The only way to acquire this map is to rob the old man. Failing to do so will make this map purchasable from a Fence.
  </li>
  <li>
   Poisonous Trail Map – Found in a lockbox underneath the bed at Cairn Lodge in Cairn Lake, East of Colter in Ambarino.
  </li>
  <li>
   Sketched Map – Found within the fireplace in Reed Cottage, North of Annesburg, Roanoke Ridge, in New Hanover.
  </li>
 </ul>

  With the Jack Hall Map acquired, it’s time to head to Caliban’s Seat, which is a cliff just South of Valentine in New Hanover. Once on top of the cliff, players are going to want to follow the rocky side down where there will be enough room for them to hug the wall and walk through. There are a few jumps here to make note of, but at the end of the path, there is a granite wall where Arthur can stick his hand inside to find the treasure for this map, thus completing Explorer Challenge #2.

All players need to do with the map is head to Cotorra Springs, a location found North of Fort Wallace, and between Window Rock and Bacchus Station in Ambarino. Once in Cotorra Springs, look to the rock pillars that are found between the second ‘o’ and ‘r’ of ‘Cotorra’, and investigate the central rock structure to find this treasure.

  The final and easiest of the Jack Hall Gang Treasure Maps is Jack Hall Gang Map 3, which should now be in the hands of players from the previous Explorer Challenge. Finding this treasure will complete Explorer Challenge #4, and the location to solve this treasure is at the center island in O’Creagh’s Run in the Grizzlies East, Ambarino. All players need to do is swim out (or ride a horse) to the central island, where on the North side of the island beside a mossy floor, there will be a rock to investigate with the treasure inside.

  Now that the Jack Hall Gang Map chain has been completed, players need a new map. An easy one to find is the Landmarks of Riches Map, with the first being located by the Obelisk landmark in the far West area of West Elizabeth, just by the Owanjila Lake which is West of Strawberry. Head to the Obelisk and investigate its central plaque to obtain a map. With the map acquired, head to the Tiny Church found East of Lakay in the Bayou Nwa, Lemoyne, and pick up the treasure that’s by the church bell on the rooftop.

  People are always curious as to who or what came first. Who made the first telephone? Who was the first to climb Mount Everest? What was the first computer? There are simple answers (e.g. Alexander Graham Bell, Edmund Hillary, Atanasoff-Berry Computer, respectively), but they’re not always necessarily the right ones as there might be contesting accounts (e.g. Antonio Meucci, Norgay Tenzing, The Difference Engine).

  It's the same with video games. Which game was the first to do what, and what impact did they have on the scene? Sometimes these questions turn up some surprises. For example,
  <em>
   Manbiki Shōnen
  </em>
  from 1979 beat
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  by 8 years to become the first stealth game. So, which fighting games turned out to be pioneers with some famous firsts?

  Capcom, SNK, Bandai-Namco, ArcSystem Works, French Bread, and other developers broke ground in the fighting game genre. But it was Sega who set the ground in the first place all the way back in 1976 with
  <em>
   Heavyweight Champ
  </em>
  . In this arcade game, up to two players used a boxing glove-shaped controller to mix between low and high strikes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game used two big, black-and-white sprites to display the action, with a basic score counter. As simple and ugly as it looks, it was a success when it hit the arcades. Unfortunately, it wasn't successful enough to avoid becoming lost media, as neither its original cabinets nor its ROMs have survived the test of time. The only version of the game available today is its 1987 remake, which played more like
  <em>
   Punch-Out
  </em>
  with a behind-the-back view.

  Most fighting games see characters trade feet and fists in hand-to-hand combat. But others prefer to clash steel against steel with weapons-based fighters, like
  <em>
   SoulCalibur
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Samurai Shodown
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   Guilty Gear
  </em>
  series. Pitting swords of all kinds against each other, or against axes, kunai, cat claws, etc., can be just as thrilling as the genre's barehanded equivalents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The earliest example on record is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warrior
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a top-down view vector arcade game where players used two sticks and a button to control the action. The button switched the player’s knight character between armed and unarmed combat. One stick controlled their movement, while the other controlled their sword. It was the first game to use motion capture, but it was tricky to get to grips with, and its cabinets were prone to hardware failures. Luckily, it can be played today via MAME.

  Trading basic kicks and punches was one thing, but fighting games caught on better once characters could pull off their own special moves. The big question is: what qualifies as a special move? Does it need to be a fireball or flashy rising uppercut, or just a better punch or kick? If it’s the latter, it would go to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Karate Champ
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where players can press a direction+punch/kick to pull off extra moves.
 </p>
 <p>
  But if fans want the former, the first
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first game to let players throw Hadoukens and Shoryukens. These did a lot of damage if they hit. The keyword being 'if', as
  <em>
   SF1
  </em>
  's controls were much stiffer compared to rival games. The CPU would let Sagat throw Tiger Shots and Tiger Knees all day, but players were stuck desperately trying to get Ryu to fire back. It's little wonder that most people prefer its more famous follow-up.

  This one seems easy, as it’s a famous story. Combos started off as a glitch in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  that let players cancel the animation of one move into the startup of another. It switched the focus of the genre from getting one big meaty strike, to seeing who could link the most attacks together. This one bug made every game that came before it feel dated overnight. Yet there were earlier games that intentionally let players combine strikes together, like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shanghai Kid
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn’t quite the same as
  <em>
   SF2
  </em>
  , as players couldn’t pull off combos right from the start. But once that ‘RUSH!’ prompt came up, players could press the punch and kick buttons in a rhythm to keep their chain of strikes going. While it was a stiffer approach compared to
  <em>
   SF2
  </em>
  , SNK were inspired to use a similar approach for their fighters, with later
  <em>
   KOF
  </em>
  games still calling their combos 'rushes.'

  Much like combos, the first game to do fatalities depends on the definition. If the term means a post-match execution players could pull off if they knew the code, then it would go to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  . If they mean a game where the player could kill their opponent with the right strike (more like
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  ’s later Brutalities), it would be
  <em>
   <strong>
    Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior
   </strong>
  </em>
  (aka
  <em>
   Death Sword
  </em>
  ). It lets fighters use a spinning slash that could decapitate foes if it connected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a goblin would turn up to drag the body away and kick the head off-screen like a football. This act of violence didn’t cause as much controversy as
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  later would, since it was less graphic. (It was an 8-bit game). However, the scantily clad model on the game's cover caused an uproar in the press. Decapitation is one thing, but barely covered body parts is apparently quite another.

  Once
  <em>
   SF2
  </em>
  made the term 'Hadouken' a household name, it was only logical that the next step up from these special moves was to produce even bigger special moves, or super combos for short. They'd be harder to pull off, as they'd usually require the player to fill a special meter, but pulling them off at the right time would deal enough damage to turn the tide of battle.
  <em>
   Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo
  </em>
  is generally credited as the first game to feature them, usually in tandem with
  <em>
   Art of Fighting 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  But Ryo and Robert could pull off their giant fireballs and attack barrages right in the first
  <strong>
   <em>
    Art of Fighting
   </em>
  </strong>
  too. They weren't commonly used, as it required the player to be low on health and high on spirit meter. Other SNK fighters at the time also required the player to either be low on health or take damage to fill their meter, making their super combos, or 'Desperation Moves', some of the first comeback mechanics in the genre.

  Surely the first 3D fighting game was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Virtua Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  ? The Guinness Book of World Records says it was, and it certainly looks the part. Those blocky figures were enough to convince other companies to get in on 3D gaming themselves. Yet Sega AM-2 was beaten to the punch by 2 years by
  <strong>
   <em>
    4D Sports Boxing
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where even blockier-looking boxers could try to beat each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   4D Sports Boxing
  </em>
  had full 3D movement (sidesteps, etc.), and used motion capture to produce realistic animations. Players could even train between bouts to boost their boxers' stats. But it was slower and stodgier than
  <em>
   VF1
  </em>
  , and only replicated different kinds of boxing as opposed to
  <em>
   VF1
  </em>
  's jeet kune do, crane kung fu, wrestling, etc. Nonetheless, the crew at Distinctive Software, including then-future Xbox head Don Mattrick, could be credited as pioneers of the 3D fighting genre.

  There are fans who prefer the weird, wacky lore behind the big series, or the variety of single-player content on display. But fighting games live or die depending on how well their online modes work, since they're ultimately about two people fighting each other, rather than one person and a CPU. It's how
  <em>
   SF2
  </em>
  helped keep arcades alive for another decade, and why fighting games almost died with them until online play became commonplace in the mid-2000s.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game to let players battle it out over the internet was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Net Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a rather generic brawler that was exclusive to SegaSoft’s Heat.net service. The game didn’t have the pizzazz to pull players away from
  <em>
   Quake 2
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  , but it worked okay for late-90s net play.
  <em>
  </em>
  It would be another two years before Capcom gave it a try with the Japan-exclusive
  <em>
   Super Street Fighter 2 X for Matching Service
  </em>
  on the Dreamcast, and 6 years before
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat: Deception
  </em>
  gave it a go in 2004.

   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has announced a new Raid Day for March 23 featuring Mega Absol. This is one of several raids that will be available for
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players to take part in this March, and add powerful pocket monsters to their collections.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until March 13,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can battle Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres in five-star raids. In their place will come Tapu Koko, who knows Nature's Madness and will stay until March 22. Then the Legendary Pokemon Heatran will be on raids until March 31. For trainers wishing to add new Max Pokemon to their Pokedex record, Dynamax Drilbur will be available in Max Battles until March 10, to be replaced by Dynamax Chansey (March 17), Dynamax Caterpie (March 23), and Dynamax Scorbunny (March 29).
 </p>
 <p>
  Another addition to the calendar is the recently announced Raid Day featuring Mega Absol. The event will take place on March 23 from 2 PM to 5 PM local time, and during these hours players will be able to battle and capture the Mega form of the Gen 3 Pokemon. During and after the event, Absol will be able to learn Charged Attack Brutal Swing, a skill with 55 power in trainer battles, and 65 power in Gyms and raids. As part of Raid Day, the Remote Raid Pass limit will be 20 from March 20 at 5 PM to March 23 at 8 PM. Due to this change, players will be able to receive five additional passes for spinning Gym Photo Discs, with the chance of finding Shiny Mega Absol.

  To make the most of Raid Day featuring Mega Absol,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  will have a paid ticket costing $5. This will give trainers who own the ticket eight extra Raid Passes for spinning Gym Photo Discs, an increased chance of receiving Candy XL from raids, and 50% more XP and double the stardust for taking part in Mega Absol raids.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  will introduce new Timed Research with rewards of 10,000 Stardust, and 1,000 extra Stardust, while the Pokemon GO Web Store will have a $5 box with an event ticket and bonus Premium Battle Pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Mega Absol is one of the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Raids happening in March, the others will be just as interesting for fans of Mega Evolutions. Until March 13, players will find Mega Lucario in raids, with Mega Marshtomp taking over and being available until March 22. From there, the game will replace Mega Marshtomp with Mega Pinsir, which will be the Pokemon featured in Mega Raids until March 31.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  is great for many things, as it presents players with a great story, tons of different NPCs to interact with, and a broad range of options regarding the build they can use. While many players gravitate towards the Warrior build, swinging melee weapons left and right, others might want to make their playthrough harder and opt for a Mage build instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who choose the latter will quickly realize that casting different types of spells can go a long way to staying away from very powerful enemies and using long-distance attacks. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best spells to use for a Mage build in
  </strong>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim

  <strong>
   Thunderbolt
  </strong>
  is an Expert-level Destruction spell, which, like Lightning Bolt, must be charged for a little while before it can be used. As opposed to Lightning Bolt, Thunderbolt has approximately 20% more range and deals considerably more damage, making it ideal for dealing with enemies at longer distances quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players combine the Impact perk with dual casting this spell and the Augmented Shock perk or an Elixir of Destruction, Thunderbolt will always stagger opponents, no matter what level or race they are. The Magicka cost isn’t great, but considering that the spell only becomes available after reaching Destruction level 75, players will most likely already have a considerable Magicka pool by then. Those who want to try a hybrid build can also follow Thunderbolt with a weapon with a powerful weapon enchantment to deal even more damage to their enemies.

  <strong>
   Fire Storm
  </strong>
  is one of those spells that are most effective when enemies are in close range to the Dragonborn, as the further away they are, the less damage they'll take. This mighty spell unleashes an explosion of flames centered around the caster and deals considerable fire damage to all surrounding creatures. As opposed to the Blizzard spell, for example, Fire Storm does not damage the Dragonborn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like Thunderbolt, Fire Storm needs to be charged for a little while before it can be used, so players must consider this, as they’ll likely have to take some damage from their enemies while the flames build up. Those who want a more complex experience might want to try some of the best mods out there for the game in combination with Fire Storm to become the ultimate threat of the land.

  As far as Expert-level Destruction spells go,
  <strong>
   Incinerate
  </strong>
  is definitely among the top five. This powerful spell deals 60 points of fire damage to the caster's target. Incinerate is widely regarded to be the big brother of the Firebolt spell, as it behaves somewhat similarly but is much more powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Augmented Flames perk, players can greatly increase the fire damage they deal to their enemies, with every level of said perk increasing the damage by 25% until reaching a maximum of 90 points of fire damage per hit. Combining Incinerate with a good armor set and some of the best armor mods for the game can go a long way in helping players hit like a truck and sustain considerable damage without losing too much HP.

  Moving away from Destruction spells and entering the realm of Alteration, there's
  <strong>
   Paralyze,
  </strong>
  which can be great for crowd control. To unlock this spell, players will first have to reach Alteration level 75, which, without using mods, can take a long time and is usually attained in the late stages of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Targets of this spell who cannot resist it will be paralyzed for 10 seconds, and with the Stability perk unlocked in the Alteration Tree, this is increased to 15 seconds. More than enough time to deal with other threats that have not been paralyzed. In combination with a good poison, Paralyze can be a powerful tool in the right hands.

 <p>
  Thus far, this list has mostly focused on offensive spells, so now it's time to move on to a very efficient and powerful defensive alternative, which is
  <strong>
   Dragonhide
  </strong>
  . This spell will likely be unlocked by players in the late stages of the game, as it requires Master-level Alteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  When used, the caster will be resistant to about 80% of all physical damage for 30 seconds, which can be the difference between emerging victorious from a challenging fight or perishing. The one downside to Dragonhide is that it costs a whopping 837 Magicka to cast, but since it’s typically unlocked at the end of the game (unless players do a ton of grinding), their Magicka pool at that point will likely be more than capable of handling it.

  Although followers in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  can be of great help during challenging fights, having undead minions to lend a hand is always welcome. This is where the
  <strong>
   Dead Thrall
  </strong>
  spell comes into play, as it allows the caster to raise the dead body of most humanoid beings under level 40 to fight by their side permanently. Once cast, the raised undead will only stop fighting for the Dragonborn once they’re killed, turned, or banished.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dead Thrall requires players to be at Conjuration level 100 and has a formidable cost of 618 Magicka. However, considering how useful an extra pair of hands can be, the trade-off is well worth it.

  Lastly, there is
  <strong>
   Invisibility
  </strong>
  , which is arguably one of the best spells players can have throughout their playthrough. To unlock it, players will have to reach Illusion level 75, which can be tough, as most of them typically focus on upgrading other branches, such as Destruction or Alteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Invisibility can also be a great spell to have if players are pursuing a Thief build, as actions such as forging business ledgers, drawing weapons, consuming items, or even feeding as a Vampire will not break the enchantment. Combined with a good mod for immersion, Invisibility can give players a completely fresh and interesting
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  experience.

  subscription gives players access to games that cover most needs. The service has lengthy RPGs like

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart

  Local co-op and split-screen games encourage friends to come together for a night in front of the TV, and the best examples of these releases on PS Plus are mentioned in this article.

  PS Plus Essential's March 2025 lineup is pretty great, although the biggest game,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , does not support co-op. The month's second-biggest game,
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  , supports only 2-player local co-op, but that is at least an option for players who want it. Finally,
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection
  </em>
  supports both local and online co-op, although the availability varies depending on the game. For online co-op, players will need to play either 1989's
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  arcade game,
  <em>
   The Hyperstone Heist
  </em>
  , or either of the
  <em>
   Turtles in Time
  </em>
  versions (but, really, pick the arcade iteration).
 </p>
 <p>
  All these titles are beat 'em up classics in their own right, and they are still a blast to play as long as expectations are kept grounded. Do not go in expecting
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, which is an entirely different beast than something like
  <em>
   Turtles in Time
  </em>
  , with the latter being far harder.

 <p>
  Joining PS Plus just a month after
  <em>
   Chivalry 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  is another medieval multiplayer game that sells itself on large-scale warfare. Modes like Invasion and Frontline place players into two teams and let them engage in coordinated battles, so they are technically candidates for online co-op experience since victory is very much a team effort. However, these
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  modes and
  <em>
   Chivalry 2
  </em>
  fall under the general banner of "multiplayer," and they might not be able to scratch a co-op itch if a group of players specifically want a mode that demands they work together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately,
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  also has Horde, which is just a straight-up co-op mode that pits six players against AI enemies.
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  mostly excels in PvP action, but Horde presents a nice PvE change of pace for those who want something a touch different. In terms of how this mode works, Horde pretty much delivers the routine that its title suggests. Players must fight off increasingly harder waves of enemies, all the while trying to upgrade their equipment to increase their chances of survival. It works well enough for what it is.

  Soulslikes are no strangers to co-op, with many games incorporating player summons in some form or another; however, the mechanic tends to be a small part of most packages rather than a defining feature. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  series is generally an exception, to the point that the first entry can be hard to recommend as a solo experience. While catering better to single-player runs thanks to the Handler class' good boy companion, the 2023 sequel is still very much sold on its online co-op support that allows three players to take on this difficult but not impossible challenge as a unit.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  expands greatly on its predecessor's selection of archetypes, which are classes. They are all fairly unique and come with a range of skills, perks, and traits that allow for varied gameplay styles that should cater to most people's preferences. Beyond just variety, parties can and should aim for synergy, creating a lineup that caters to different roles like tank and healer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is generally great as far as online co-op PS Plus games are concerned, but it does require an appreciation for Soulslikes and third-person shooters. The game is a fairly "typical" entry in both genres that will likely not hit the mark with people who do not generally enjoy these types of projects. The campaign incorporates procedurally generated elements as well for replayability's sake, although it is primarily related to secondary dungeons. While implemented well, this feature can be divisive since the stages can be a bit nondescript at times.

  Sure,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  can be played and enjoyed solo for 100+ hours without much issue; however, the game pushes its co-op element, something that can be said for most entries in Capcom's franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has two types of quests: Village and Hub. The former are single-player only and, in total, last about 10 hours. While a bit too easy for veterans, these quests serve as an introduction for newcomers, teaching them the basic skills they will need to stand a chance in the harder missions. Once someone gets through the Village quests or feels confident in their abilities, they should head to the Hub to try out its many hunts, which are far harder and can be played in co-op.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  handles its co-op brilliantly, making it as easy as possible for friends to team up while removing some of the more frustrating elements in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  . Parties can try to synergize their builds to create a well-rounded team; alternatively, they can simply go with their preferred loadout and ignore everything else. As the Hub quests can take quite a long time to complete, co-op makes them easier to digest and arguably more enjoyable.

  <em>
   Vermintide 2

  While the vanilla version only has 13 missions (+4 from free updates), the stages are meant to be repeated endlessly as players upgrade their class and weapons.

  Supermassive's
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  is an anthology series that will eventually include 8 games; at the moment, four main entries have been released along with a VR spin-off. While not quite as robust as Supermassive's other horror projects like
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  ' chapters are consistently great picks for co-op, especially local. In online co-op,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  opts for a shared experience where players get to stir the ship for a while before handing over control to their friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although overshadowed by the couch iteration,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  ' online co-op is a valid option in its own right. Limited to two participants, the game automatically picks who will be actively playing the campaign and decides when to switch control. This system might not be to everyone's fancy, but it does provide a unique co-op experience since one player's actions directly impact the full group.

  Housemarque knows a thing or two about co-op.
  <em>
   Dead Nation
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  all make good use of the feature, and they support both local and online connections. The developer's most recent project,
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  , did not launch with multiplayer, but an online two-player co-op option was added as part of the
  <em>
   Ascension
  </em>
  update. Thanks to this addition, players can now join forces to take on the game's roguelike challenges, and there is the option to use a public or private server.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is challenging, and co-op does not necessarily make the experience easier. However, it does introduce a revive option into the gameplay loop, granting players a second chance. Otherwise, co-op provides essentially the same core experience as solo runs, albeit with two Selenes rather than just one. As the base package is fantastic, the same can be said about
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  's co-op.

  They might not come around as often as they once did, but it is always an exciting day when a
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  </em>
  game launches. And, in a nice change of pace from most of the franchise's post-2000s efforts,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is also great. Looking to recapture the Turtles' beat 'em up glory days, Tribute Games basically created a game ripped right out of the '90s, albeit with enough modern touches for it to come across as a loving homage rather than just an antiquated throwback. Up to six players can join forces to take on the Foot Clan, and they are free to pick from the Turtles, Master Splinter, April, and Casey Jones. Even at face value, that is a more than solid selection for this type of game, and that is before taking into account each character's unique traits. All the playable figures bring something fresh to the table, so even solo players can enjoy replaying the campaign by switching between the characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  sticks fairly close to the standard beat 'em up formula. The characters have a limited but satisfying moveset, and the levels pack a considerable punch. The boss fights are quite difficult and require mastery of the combat system's mechanics to overcome. The stages are overflowing with references to
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  's past, and the nods cover many of the franchise's sides rather than just its gaming history.

  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is the most famous asymmetrical multiplayer game on the market, and that seems unlikely to change anytime soon. The game pits four survivors against one killer, with many of the available characters being based on popular IPs (although there are several original creations too). While one side of the equation will not be cooperating with anyone, the survivors should try to work together since they are considerably weaker than any of the killers. That said, players are largely left to their own devices, so they can decide themselves whether they wish to prioritize communication or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is kind of a weird inclusion as it is primarily advertised as an online multiplayer rather than co-op experience, which makes sense since matches are PvP rather than a group of players against AI. Nevertheless, it still works well as a co-op game, and it is among the best and most popular titles on PS Plus.

  2018's
  <em>
   Tetris Effect
  </em>
  gave the ultimate classic video game a contemporary makeover, creating a modern reimagining that stuck true to the original's blueprint while carving out a unique identity all of its own. That version was and still is fantastic, an easy recommendation for players craving a robust puzzle game designed around solo content. In 2020,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  hit the market, an upgrade that – as suggested by its subtitle – focused on multiplayer. Providing a fairly addictive PvP experience, this iteration incorporated a range of modes that complement the gameplay loop. While
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is largely associated with single-player content, the franchise is obviously a good match for competitive play, and
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  showcases as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  As fun as PvP is,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  is specifically named after its online co-op mode. This option allows a few players to share the screen as they work towards completing separate puzzles while taking on an AI opponent. On the surface, this might sound like a basic implementation of co-op that does not add all that much to the core experience; however,
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  has one great twist: the players' puzzles combine to create a single canvas. This development is a treat whenever it triggers during matches, and it creates a cooperative exchange that works wonders.

  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  is a first-person co-op shooter reminiscent of
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  . Turtle Rock's project wears its influences on its sleeve, which is hardly a terrible thing considering the market is not flooded with these sorts of titles.
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  has solid gameplay and visuals, along with a card-based customization system that permits players to tweak their loadouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The differences between
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  's playable survivors are not skin-deep either. Each character has unique traits and default weapons, which encourages teams to craft parties consisting of survivors that bring the best out of each other. Even though it is not a masterpiece and has had a fairly short lifespan for this type of project,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  is more than good enough to keep a group of friends engaged for a few hours.

  Another zombie shooter akin to something like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4: Dead War
  </em>
  is for those people who prefer a third-person perspective. Even though the game does not quite have the same name recognition as either of those projects, it is a respectable entry in the subgenre. As is always the case, four players can join forces to blast their way through fairly self-contained levels filled with a colorful and grotesque assortment of flesh-eaters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  shakes things up by being set after World War 2 and granting a Nazi coat of paint to its armies of the walking dead. This setting is the element that distinguishes the game the most from its peers, and the campaign makes good use of the premise.
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  guides players through an over-the-top and entertaining story that is long enough to feel substantial without overstaying its welcome. Along with a decent selection of weapons,
  <em>
   Dead War
  </em>
  uses a rewarding perk system that adds some flavor to combat.

  Frozenbyte's
  <em>
   Trine
  </em>
  is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for co-op-driven action-platformer games. All the franchise's titles are worth seeking out, however, PS Plus subscribers will need to settle for
  <em>
   Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince
  </em>
  . Despite the number in its title, this entry can be enjoyed without prior knowledge of its predecessors, so newcomers can start here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  follows three heroes (a mage, thief, and knight) as they go on an epic fantasy-laden adventure that tests their might and teamwork. While not devoid of combat, the campaign focuses on puzzles and platforming, with the former requiring creative use of the characters' abilities. In solo runs, players can switch between the characters with the click of a button; in co-op, each user takes charge of one hero.
  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  features two modes: Classic and Unlimited. The former ties three players to specific heroes, while the latter allows four users to swap to any character whenever they want.

  October 2024's PS Plus Extra and Premium lineup had quite a few online co-op options.
  <em>
   Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed
  </em>
  is an asymmetrical multiplayer game that lets people take charge of either ghostbusters or ghosts, while
  <em>
   Firefighting Simulator The Squad
  </em>
  allows four players to team up to battle fires.
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me
  </em>
  is another one of Supermassive's short but generally engaging horror experiences, and it is a fine entry that should hit the mark with people who enjoyed the other stories in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  While all those are decent titles, the month's headline act was
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  , both in terms of general size and also co-op support. After spending a long time in development hell, this sequel finally materialized in 2023 and, to everybody's surprise, was pretty good!
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  drops players in Los Angeles and mostly encourages them to kill every zombie in their wake, and there are plenty of them. Everything is framed through missions that gradually open up small-ish self-contained maps, so the campaign is fairly streamlined. The story is nothing special, but the combat is pretty awesome, especially the melee side of things.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  indulges in gore and excess, delivering an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop that is enhanced with a few RPG elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Co-op is implemented fairly well and becomes available within the first hour of a playthrough. Players can pick from six slayers, who are essentially classes with unique skills. That said, they are not that different, and a party can include duplicates.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is a blast solo and even better with friends.

  FromSoftware's
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games incorporate a unique form of multiplayer that enables players to visit each other's worlds, and the
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  remake is no exception. Depending on the item used, players can either invade and engage in PvP or be summoned to provide a helping hand. While the former tends to get more attention, the latter is also a common practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to four players can convene to take on the game's plethora of challenging fights, with the helpers being sent back to their universes if they die or take down a boss. It should be noted that while co-op is ongoing, two invaders can also show up to add a PvP twist to the tale, so players should always be on their toes.

  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  's co-op is kind of weird. On the one hand, it is an exciting feature that should and does serve as a selling point for the game. Conversely, co-op is added fairly haphazardly, with the extra players essentially being along for the ride rather than active parts of the story. The feature also came with its share of bugs, although Techland has released quite a few updates with fixes since the game's debut.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting aside all that stuff,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  's gameplay loop is so fun and addictive that bringing on a few friends naturally adds to the mayhem, even if some aspects of co-op are a bit broken. Set in an impressively designed open-world, the game is all about parkour and movement, encouraging players to free-run across buildings and streets while fighting off both zombies and humans. While not necessarily scary,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  can be very intense, particularly at night when the infected flood the streets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it should be noted that only the host player can progress in their story, which can be a bit frustrating for people planning to play through the whole campaign together. Still, everyone keeps their acquired items, so it is not like they receive no progression.

  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  builds on its predecessor's solid foundations. The action RPG tries to be both a single-player third-person shooter and a live-service always-online experience, and, for the most part, it does an impressive job.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main story will keep players engaged for a good 30 hours, and this section can be largely enjoyed solo. Alternatively, most of the campaign can be experienced in co-op, which unlocks after the story's intro is completed. In comparison, the endgame content revolves heavily around PvP and online co-op. Four players can combine to create squads and take on missions, while that number is doubled for raids.

  PS Plus Extra has a few co-op games capable of scratching someone's "blast zombies in the face" itch, and
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  compares favorably with any of its peers. Despite being fairly old by this point, the 2016 release holds up well thanks to its enjoyably over-the-top core gameplay loop along with a surprisingly addictive progression system. The campaign guides teams through a series of levels filled with wave after wave of enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  's gameplay loop is not complicated, and it is arguably simpler than games like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  ; however, it is complemented by Perks that essentially serve as classes. Coming with unique abilities and weapons, each Perk can be leveled up, which adds a lot of replayability to the package.
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  supports up to 6 players simultaneously, and this is one of those games that simply needs to be experienced in co-op. Technically, single-player is an option, and while not unplayable, it is not great either.

  In 2023,
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  celebrated its 10th anniversary, and the co-op shooter is still as popular as ever. The game has a simple but brilliant premise: team up with friends to pull off heists. It is possible to take on missions solo, but
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  is intended to be experienced with a consistent group of friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  The progression system revolves around unlocking better gear and skills, both of which play significant roles in enhancing a crew's professionalism. Consequently, players genuinely feel like they are improving with each new heist as their crew gradually morphs into a well-oiled machine.

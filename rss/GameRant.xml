  Though
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  consoles haven't exactly been known for housing tons of Japanese-style games, JRPG support for the platform has improved considerably in recent years. Not too long ago, the prospect of
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Hyperdimension Neptunia
  </em>
  games releasing on Xbox consoles was unheard of. Nowadays, though, all of these franchises can be found on Microsoft's platform. On top of that, certain developers that were once notorious for skipping Xbox consoles, like Atlus and RGG Studio, have even partnered up with Microsoft to market their upcoming games. Titles like
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like a Dragon
  </em>
  are great examples in this regard.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, though, there are still quite a few JRPG franchises that elude the Xbox platform to this day. Two of the most notable ones are the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  series, both of which are helmed by the independent Japanese developer Nihon Falcom. Despite the fact that these long-running JRPG franchises are still currently active, neither of them has yet to fully make the jump to the Microsoft ecosystem. With game developers and publishers like Atlus and Square Enix embracing a more multiplatform approach lately, it's about time that Falcom takes a page out of their playbooks and starts supporting all consoles, including Xbox.

  Though they do share some surface-level similarities, the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  franchises are both fairly distinct from one another and have several defining traits. The former of the two IPs, for instance, is a science fantasy, turn-based RPG series that takes place in different nations within the fictional continent of Zemuria. This franchise made its debut with 2004's
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky
  </em>
  , which first came out on Windows PC in Japan and later received a Western launch on the PSP in 2011.

 <p>
  Since the release of the first game in the series,
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  has gone on to span an additional 19 installments over the last 20 years, including a plethora of spin-offs that never received English localizations. As if that wasn't enough, the series has also been adapted to a number of different mediums throughout its lifetime, from books, manga, and anime to musicals, audio dramas, and even trading card games.

 <p>
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  , on the other hand, is an action-fantasy role-playing franchise that chronicles the adventures of a young, red-haired man named Adol Christin, who travels throughout the world in search of wonders in new lands. Unlike the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  games, which have an interconnected story that spans several entries,
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  titles are more standalone in nature, despite the fact that they mostly share the same protagonist. While this series has shifted genres over the years since its debut in 1987, recent
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  games have largely embraced fast-paced, hack-and-slash combat, a stark contrast compared to the more tactical, turn-based gameplay found in the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  franchise.

  Trails and Ys Games Have Been Released on Multiple Platforms
 </h3>
 <p>
  Given how long both
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  have been around, it should come as no surprise that the two franchises have been made available on several different platforms throughout the years.
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  , for example, has made an appearance on a plethora of consoles, including the Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis, SNES, Nintendo DS, PS2, PS Vita, and Turbographix-CD. The
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  series, meanwhile, has largely been exclusive to PlayStation and PC platforms throughout most of its existence, as the franchise made its debut on Nintendo platforms only recently with the Switch release of the 2019 Japan-only spin-off
  <em>
   , The Legend of Heroes: Trails at Sunrise
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Out of these two franchises,
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  is the only one to ever come to Xbox consoles. In 2018, a remaster of the 2006 titl
  <em>
   e Ys Origin
  </em>
  landed on Xbox One, following its initial release on PS4 and PS Vita a year prior. Since then, however, none of the other installments in Falcom's JRPG franchise have been ported to Microsoft's consoles. Instead, titles like the upcoming
  <em>
   Ys 10: Nordics
  </em>
  are only slated to launch on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The same can be said for the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  series, which has so far opted to release on just about every modern platform except Xbox.

 <p>
  Perhaps the reason why Falcom and its publishing partner NIS America are so hesitant to put their games on Xbox is because they're afraid the games won't sell well. After all, due to the erratic release cadence of JRPGs on the platform, the fanbase for the genre on Xbox isn't nearly as large as on PlayStation or Nintendo. Additionally, lower sales of the Xbox Series X/S compared to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch might deter the publisher from launching games on the system.

  NIS America's Decision to Omit the Xbox Platform Seems Strange
 </h3>
 <p>
  If the limited number of Xbox owners is indeed the primary reason behind the lack of
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  games on the console, though, then it does bring into question NIS America's decision to release titles from both franchises on platforms with far smaller install bases than the Series X/S. For example, games like
  <em>
   Ys 9: Monstrum Nox
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana
  </em>
  were released on the now-defunct cloud streaming service Stadia, while the latter of the two was even added to Amazon Luna. Additionally, many
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  titles were released for the PlayStation Vita, a console that infamously underperformed sales-wise.

 <p>
  To top it all off, Falcom and NIS are even
  <em>
  </em>
  developing an abridged Android and iOS port of
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  <em>
   8
  </em>
  . While these two platforms have a far larger install base than any of the consoles on the market, ports of AAA games on mobile phones often don't sell well, as the traditional, buy-to-play business model usually doesn't mesh with the spending habits of consumers on Android and iOS. As such, the fact that NIS America and Falcom are bringing their titles to platforms like Stadia, Amazon Luna, and mobile phones before Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S seems like a rather strange business decision, at least from the outside looking in.

  At the end of the day, it's a shame that Xbox players can't experience the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  series on their preferred platform, as many of the games in Nihon Falcom's JRPG franchises are widely regarded as some of the best titles the genre has to offer. Hopefully, NIS America ends up having a change of heart in the near future and finally stops neglecting
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  consoles with these two series.

  Gold isn't the end-all-be-all resource of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but it is important to have for certain moments, and characters with a lower Charisma are always going to need some extra cash for those higher prices. Some of the game's best armor pieces and equipment are only sold by vendors, and there are areas where having a lot of gold can make things much easier, like bribing guards who saw you commit a crime.

  When it comes to the best methods to make gold in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  , players have a few options. The most obvious ways to make money are to sell items to vendors and complete quests, but it's a lot more nuanced than that. Make even more gold by following these Gold farming methods and tips for saving (or recovering) money along the way.

   : The best way to collect the most gold in BG3 comes down to two things: selling items and completing quests, while other methods might depend on class or moral alignment. Found gold is also a common thing, so open up all those chests and backpacks, and don't forget the fine art of pick-pocketing. It's also possible to improve the Vendors' attitude towards the player, so their character can save it instead of spend it.

  For the most part, the only way to increase vendor Attitude directly in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is to give them gifts, though some vendors also act as quest givers or respond to the events of other quests. These vendors' Attitude is much more easily increased, though they are far fewer in number.

 <p>
  The amount of Attitude improvement you get with a vendor depends on the value of the goods or the amount of gold given to them. It's better to bribe vendors than to give them items as gifts, as you can still sell those items later on when your Attitude is maxed out and they will offer significantly more for it, allowing you to recoup your losses.

 <p>
  At the beginning of the game, it's a good idea to focus on improving your relationships with vendors who will re-appear later in the game. For instance, Dammon, the Tiefling blacksmith, offers the party his wares in each part of the game. If you improve your standing early, you won't have to worry about it later on.

  One of the best ways to earn Gold quickly throughout all of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is to constantly pick up and sell items to vendors, and not just the ones that are worth a lot. Common armor pieces and weapons sell for a decent chunk of money and most equipment from the humble Goblin Scimitar to Heavy Armor pieces are worth much more than their weight in gold.

 <p>
  Once the party reaches its maximum carry capacity, head to a vendor, sell off the junk and get back to looting. The fastest way to earn gold in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is to loot and vendor off everything that can be picked up with a decent weight-to-value ratio, and that includes stolen goods.

  Equipment aside, even environmental items and other decorations can be picked up and sold. Silver Plates, platters, and other bits of cutlery can be found on many dining tables, and are worth 30 gold at least with a minuscule weight.

  Once players have done a bit of looting as they progress through the game, they may notice that some items have been sitting there, untouched, for much longer than other items. Some Potions just don't do much for the party composition, some scrolls offer the same spells taken up by Cantrips in the party. Ingots and jewels have little purpose outside of specific questlines, and only with certain uniquely named items.

  Pause your adventure through

  every dozen hours or so to take a look at the inventory and prune anything that isn't worth holding onto. Chances are, the party won't miss those items if you weren't using them anyway. The only exceptions here are Rare and Very Rare items, which sometimes can't be acquired again after being sold.

  Aside from quests, though, players can find chests out in the open world and in dungeons, most of which contain a lump sum of gold alongside other items. One of the best ways to get gold in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is to have a high Survival or Nature skill and keep a shovel on hand.

 <p>
  Sometimes, the party will come across a clue, note, or map that reveals a hidden stash. In this case, the location of the buried treasure will be marked on your map. The player still needs a shovel to get to it, but it doesn't matter if they fail the usual check. Digging nearby will still uncover the chest, which is better than getting another Companion from camp just to see if they can pass the check instead.

  After completing a major end-of-act boss fight in Act 2, for example, players can speak with several NPCs whose questlines ended with this character's death – each of these characters rewards players with hundreds of Gold as thanks. Quests that reward a magical item instead of a hunk of Gold are still worth completing because equipment the party can't use can still be sold for a profit.

 <p>
  If acting like a loot goblin and selling everything companions can fit in their pockets doesn't sound like a very engaging way to make money, consider the adventuring life instead. Though not every side quest in the game offers a tangible reward, most will reward players with either a magical item or a chunk of gold upon completion.

  One of the reasons that Astarion is in almost every core
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  party is because he's the Rogue with the Sleight of Hand. The Trickster Cleric Shadowheart also has it, but lacks any of the usual class bonuses, and another exception might be the protagonist depending on their class.

 <p>
  Several other classes can pick locks, and disarming traps is also a helpful skill to go along with it. A trapped chest that explodes, catches fire, or otherwise destroys itself also destroys the contents. Players with a high Lockpicking and Sleight of Hand skill can always break into locked chests. Locked chests often hold better loot, and more gold, than chests found through Survival checks.

  One unique way
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  gold can be earned is through the Performance skill. When an Instrument is equipped, preferably alongside Musical Instrument Proficiency, the Performance skill can be used to draw in a crowd. A crowd that will pay, if the players' Performance checks are up to the task.

 <p>
  To earn gold while playing an instrument, just sit back and watch as the audience tosses gold on the ground toward the performing player. As long as they continue to pass Performance checks, the crowd will continue to leave Tips. It's not the fastest way to earn money in
  <em>
   BG3

  , nor is it the most efficient gold farming method, but it's a nice way to get a few dozen gold pieces and cause a distraction at the same time.

  Players who aren't feeling particularly up to the task of performing songs for a crowd, or who would rather take what they want rather than deal with pesky merchants, can always try out the Pickpocket skill. Pickpocketing in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  requires a high Sleight of Hand skill to be successful, which typically makes Rogues the class most suited for this sort of work.

 <p>
  When a character uses the Sneak ability, the ability to talk to NPCs is replaced with the Pickpocket prompt. Pickpocket an NPC to bring up their inventory, and click on each item to see what the dice roll needed to successfully steal it is. Smaller, cheaper items are typically easier to steal, though gold itself is not as hard of a check to beat as one might think.

  There are two particularly lucrative ways to pickpocket and earn Gold in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  : stealing from Merchants to take back money spent on their wares or stealing from Withers to take back money spent on respeccing and hiring hirelings. Withers offers services for 100 and 200 gold but keeps this stash on his person at all times. For some reason, Withers doesn't care if players pickpocket their money back from him, no matter how many attempts it takes.

      <title>Elden Ring: Best Fist Weapons, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  has a deep arsenal of weapons for players to seize their destiny with. With a variety of weapon classes and damage types,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  allows players to fine-tune their build to their specific play style. For those who enjoy putting on a thick set of armor and punching their way through enemies and boss encounters, look no further than the Fist weapon class.

 <p>
  Fist weapons may lack the range of other weapons, but they can pack a massive punch with the right stats. These weapons provide speedy combos as well, letting the Tarnished get a few shots off before most enemies are finished swinging. A proper setup can allow the player to bulldoze their way across The Lands Between, with enemies falling left and right at their fingertips.

    Updated July 25 ,2024 by Erik Petrovich
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   : Though the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC introduced a number of new weapon types and completely fresh armaments to the game, it also brought along some new options in the game's base weapon types. One of the weapon types that got the most love is the Fist weapon type, which got no fewer than six new additions in the DLC. But two of these new DLC Fist weapons stand out: the Pata, and the Golem Fist – the Pata, for its reach, and the Golem Fist for its Strength scaling and ability to break Poise. This guide to the best Elden Ring fist weapons has been updated to include these two new DLC Fist weapons, including brief notes on where to find these new Fist weapons in the Realm of Shadow.

   Caestus

  is a fine intro to fist weapons, but is largely outclassed by weapons found later in the game. This weapon can be infused with other ashes of war for creative builds, but the Tarnished will still likely want to replace the Caestus down the road.

   Katar
  </span>
  comes with the Impaling Thrust Ash of War. The weapon features a small handle with a short, wide blade at the end, and deals both slashing and piercing damage. The Katar scales with both strength and dexterity, and can be infused with other Ashes of War.

 <p>
  This weapon is a decent upgrade from the Caestus, though it lacks in scaling when compared to other weapons found later in the journey. Though, the Katar gets points on looks alone, and is a great addition to any outfit in

  players must go to Fort Gael, above the western coast of Caelid. It's northwest from the Caelid Waypoint Ruins, and directly west of the Gaol Cave, though the Fort Gaol entrance can only be accessed by heading up the slope south of the Cave's entrance. Once inside, look for a Chest on a platform above one of the Lion Guardian minibosses.

  One of the new
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  Fist weapons is the Pata. Not to be confused with the Cipher Pata from the base game (another
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fist weapon that guarantees hits, but only deals Holy damage), the Pata is one of the best new Fist weapons because of its reach. It's also the weapon that Needle Knight Leda uses, though hers is a unique NPC version.

 <p>
  It deals basic Standard and Pierce damage, and scales decently with Dexterity, but its real strength is its attack range. It looks almost like a shortsword, but strikes with the Fist Weapon attack moveset, making for a very fast, and very effective, short-range blade build.

  The Golem Fist is an exceptional Fist Weapon
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  introduces because, when fully upgraded, its Strength scaling reaches A. Though Fist weapon builds are more typically Dex based than Strength based, the
  <em>
   SOTE
  </em>
  Golem Fist stands out because it's one of the few great options for Strength players.

 <p>
  Aside from its Strength scaling, the Golem Fist seems to break Poise faster than other Fist weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This is perhaps due to its weight – at a hefty 6.0 weight, it's one of the heaviest "light" weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .

  To get the Golem Fist,
  <em>

  players must head to Taylew's Ruined Forge, in Rauh Base to the north of Scadu Altus (and below it, vertically). Progress through the Forge until you reach a pipe. Run to the top of this pipe to see two platforms. On the southern platform you will see two Forge Golems. Defeat the Golem that fires ranged Fire attacks at you to get the Golem Fist weapon.

  This weapon is essentially the Caestus, but with spikes that cause bleed build-up in enemies unlucky enough to cross the player's path. Bleed makes a decent weapon good, and a good weapon great, and being built into the Spiked Caestus makes it all the better.

   Cipher Pata
  </span>
  is a very interesting fist weapon, as it scales with only Faith, and requires 30 Faith to wield effectively. For pure faith builds, this weapon is top-notch.

 <p>
  Cipher Pata is imbued with the Unblockable Blade ash of war, which charges the blade with light before sending out a piercing thrust that can't be blocked. Unblockable Blade only costs 17 FP, so users can dish it out on repeat with enough points in the mind stat.

  Lifesteal Fist is only effective against foes of human build, so it's not likely to assist against the giant behemoths Elden Ring likes to throw at the player. Still, Clinging Bone is a lifesaver in tight spots, especially in deep caves and catacombs.

   Star Fist

  is guaranteed to send shivers down the spine of any enemy. The Star Fist has a solid physical damage stat, and comes with blood loss build up just like the Spiked Caestus. It's a little heavier, but there's 14 more damage in that extra pound.

 <p>
  The Tarnished can pair this weapon with Hoarah Loux's Earthquake Ash of War for a strong combination. Equipping two Star Fists can deal slightly more damage than two-handing the single weapon, but doesn't grant the unique 2h moveset for fist weapons.

 <p>
  To get the Star Fist
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players must first head to the West capital Rampart Site of Lost Grace in Leyndell, then head towards the Colosseum. Once you get to its entrance, walk around its left side, and look for an opening containing a body. Loot the body to get the Star Fist.

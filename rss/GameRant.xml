  A
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  bug has made it impossible for players to catch PhD Pikachu, which is one of the most difficult-to-get Pokemon in the game, as it simply flees when players throw a Poke Ball at it. Considering that this encounter is tied to a
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  achievement, which is also known as Medals in the game, it is supposed to be a guaranteed encounter, but players are reportedly unable to catch the Pokemon altogether.

 <p>
  PokeStop Showcases were introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  as part of the 7th Anniversary Event, and they have quickly become a popular mechanic in the game. PokeStop Showcases are a great way for players to show off their special Pokemon and compete with others, and also earn some lucrative rewards along the way. Some PokeStop Showcases can be quite difficult to win, as a lot of players take part in them to grab the top spots. However, it seems like a frustrating bug is affecting the feature in the game.

 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  subreddit, user FitzRigo18 reveals a frustrating bug that players have been facing in the game lately. They state that right now it is not possible to catch PhD Pikachu in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , as it will flee every time when players try to throw a Poke Ball at it during the encounter. What makes things worse is the fact that any berries or Poke Ball used in the process are lost altogether even though the Pokemon is not caught due to the bug. The user adds that they were eagerly looking forward to catching the Pokemon for a while now, considering how cumbersome the achievement is, but the issue left them disappointed.

 <p>
  PhD Pikachu is one of the rarest Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  because it is extremely difficult to get one. Players need to win 100 PokeStop Showcases to get the Pokemon, and it can take quite a while to get to that number. PokeStop Showcases are only held during specific days of the week, and players have to compete against others to win them.

  Some players noted that they were considering holding off on completing the achievement until the bug is fixed, but others highlighted that the encounter doesn't go away. Several fans have escalated this issue to Niantic support and are hoping that this bug is fixed in the next

  update and that they finally get their well-deserved rewards.

      <title>5 Best Action JRPGs With No Grinding</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    JRPGs
   </strong>
  </em>
  have a series of characteristics that make them unique: flashy colors, even flashier characters, epic battles, and endless grinding for levels and items. This last part is the least favorite of many fans, but there are some titles that offer alternatives to this obsolete (and annoying) system — and they're are packed with lots of action too.

 <p>
  For players looking for less grind and more story and epic battles, then the
  <em>
   Suikoden
  </em>
  series is the ideal choice. The first two iterations of the franchise (
  <strong>
   <em>
    Suikoden I
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Suikoden II
   </em>
  </strong>
  ) are considerably shorter than most JRPGs available today in the market, and that is a good thing if players are looking for a good story and a relaxed experience to enjoy. Plus, their Remaster versions are now available to play on Steam, and that's even cooler.

 <p>
  Perhaps the only exception to the rule in the
  <em>
   Suikoden
  </em>
  series is
  <em>
   Suikoden 4,
  </em>
  since this game broke the rule of low encounter rate, and roaming around its world can be a nightmare for players trying to avoid fights. Still,
  <em>
   Suikoden 3 and 5
  </em>
  are great choices as well, and much more modern if graphics are an important factor.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a great place for new players to enter into contact with
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes
  </em>
  series, since it has a lot less grinding than most of the games in the series and is also visually attractive. Its interface has a really comfortable design, as well. Though
  <em>
   Trails in the Sky indeed
  </em>
  has far less grinding than
  <em>
   Trails of Cold Steel,
  </em>
  what makes this game great is that it has an enthralling story and could be just what players are looking for in a JRPG.

  The game and most of its predecessors are available on PC through Steam and other platforms like Nintendo Switch, so if players find this entry of the series comfortable enough, they can jump right into other parts of the story since their plots are easy enough to follow up, even if played in reverse.

  If players are looking for a JRPG that privileges tactics, composition, builds, and out-of-the-box thinking before mindless grinding for hours, then
  <em>
   The Last Remnant

  might hit all those marks and more. This game is considerably more difficult than most JRPGs, with merciless boss battles that will punish players if they don't position themselves correctly, or if their team comp is not solid enough.

 <p>
  The way characters gain stats is unlike any traditional JRPG, with a particular system that levels up the stats of the characters every time they take an action during battle. In that way, they will slowly but steadily improve their skills, and using them consistently is the best way to bring up the best qualities of each character.

  , and as a matter of fact, the game has an absolute level cap mechanic that its impossible to overcome depending on the stages of the game. Players can, though hire units that are above the level cap, though these won't keep leveling unless they progress further during the adventure. Combat has a lot of action, and an enthralling story as well, with a soundtrack that rivals that of classics like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy VII, VIII
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   Chrono
  </em>
  series.

  Be it as it may, the game has some hard-to-understand leveling mechanics, that not only depend on the game stage, the level cap, but other factors like training, and the progress players make in story missions. This tactical JRPG is similar to the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  series since it also boasts a class system. Quite fun to play, though.

 <p>
  Chrono Cross is arguably, one of the best JRPGs made to date, with deep storytelling, a twisted chronology that confuses the players but somewhat still makes sense, and some memorable characters that are hard to forget. Even more so, the game lacks the usual "grind for levels" mechanic, and it only privileges battle strategy, composition, and equipment.

 <p>
  Characters do not level up in the traditional sense, but they gain better stats every time they beat a powerful enemy (aka Boss), and this progress is also carried through to other characters the player hasn't recruited yet, so it's an equalizer of sorts. This also can make encounters in between boss fights sort of meaningless, if not for its Crafting System that is unlocked further during the adventure. There, all the materials players gathered start to make some sense, even those weird Rainbow Shells that the game never explains what they're for until the mechanic drops on them like an anvil. Really fun to play, and
  <em>
   The Radical Dreamers Collection
  </em>
  makes it even more interesting to re-visit for veteran players.

  The
  <strong>
   PS5
  </strong>
  is moving along nicely, and 2024 could shape up to be the generation's biggest year yet. There are already plenty of amazing games to play. The system's backward compatibility alone grants players access to some of their favorite titles with a serious graphical boost.

  There are quite a few
  <strong>
   great co-op games
  </strong>
  players can run on their PS5s and play with friends locally or through the internet. Enthralling storylines have never been the domain of these kinds of titles, but it doesn't mean that good writing has never been successfully incorporated into a co-op game.

   <strong>
    Updated September 22, 2024 by Mark Sammut: Co-op PS5 games with great stories
   </strong>
   are quite rare, with most cooperative projects emphasizing gameplay. For example, Earth Defense Force 6 is a fantastic co-op option, but it cannot be recommended for its story (which, to be fair, gets the job done). The same can be said for Core Keeper or Risk of Rain 2. TimeSplitters: Future Perfect has a great co-op story, but that is a PS2 port that happens to be available on PS5.

  The
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  games are just the best bite-sized RPGs. All three entries offer delightful romps with simple but satisfying combat, streamlined progression and weapon systems, and a whole lot of cat puns. The latter is enough to warrant a recommendation, but
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  has way more to offer than witty dialogue that emphasizes the franchise's adorableness. Overall, this is probably the best game in the series, which means something in a franchise defined by consistency.

 <p>
  While not revolving around co-op like
  <em>
   Cat Quest 2
  </em>
  , which has two protagonists who are both central to the story, the 2024 sequel's implementation of the feature is arguably just as good, at least in terms of the gameplay. Although not important to the story, the second player can mostly do the same things as the main user, so they should not feel too short-changed. Narratively,
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  mostly just tasks players to find a treasure before a sinister pirate, a situation that serves as a justifiable excuse to explore the gorgeous world. Nobody is going to claim the plot is deep, but it fits the game's tone and world perfectly, all the while presenting plenty of opportunities to interact with cute NPCs.

 <p>
  OK, this one is rated on a curve. Beat 'em up games focus very little on their stories, usually just throwing out a few still images in between stages.
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is no different, and its narrative is largely irrelevant and certainly not a reason to pick up the project. However, relative to similar releases, the story is charming and well done. The game includes a lot of references to past
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  projects, filling the campaign with Easter Eggs and identifiable bosses.

 <p>
  If someone is specifically craving an accessible beat 'em up with fantastic co-op,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge

  is arguably the best option on the PS5. They also get to play through a cute story filled with loving nods to the franchise's legacy.

 <p>
  This case is weird. Starbreeze's
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  was specifically designed around the player controlling two siblings simultaneously, a decision that helped foster a strong connection with the characters while also complementing the story's theme of brotherhood and dependency. Despite seemingly being ideal for co-op, Starbreeze deliberately avoided adding multiplayer to the game, and while playing it, this omission never feels like an oversight or mistake.

 <p>
  Avantgarden's remake adds co-op, allowing each player to control one brother. Except for a graphical upgrade, this change is the main difference offered by the 2024 version, and it arguably produced a less memorable overall experience. That said,
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake

  is still an above-average
  <strong>
   PS5 co-op game with a great story
  </strong>
  that can readily be completed in a single sitting. Even if it does not reach the heights of the original, it is still worth playing.

  OK, it might be a stretch to describe
  <em>
   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  's story as "great" since it plays things very safe. That said, the game is a spot-on imitation of James Cameron's movies in this area, delivering a straightforward but sound narrative defined by epic action alongside plenty of opportunities to take in the Western Frontier's natural beauty. The latter is undoubtedly
  <em>
   Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  's main selling point since the open-world is nothing short of gorgeous, along with being as expansive as any other modern Ubisoft project.

  Considering the gameplay is not far removed from
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  , the fact
  <em>
   Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  handles co-op similarly to that franchise makes sense.

  is generally presented as a single-player experience, but a guest can jump in at any moment, and their progress will be saved for their campaigns. Although nothing too special, this system works well and helps extend the game's staying power.

  <em>
   Gotham Knights

  garnered a mixed reception at launch, and that is being kind. In truth, it was among 2022's most disappointing games, and its reputation has not started to mend. However, nowadays,
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  is far easier to recommend since it is frequently discounted and can be accessed through subscription services like PS Plus Extra. And, for all the title's flaws, its story is quite good.

  Sure,
  <em>
   Gotham Knight
  </em>
  's plot does not reach the same heights as the Bat Family's greatest comic storylines nor does it match Rocksteady's trilogy, but that does not mean it has no value. The playable characters share a camaraderie that feels genuine, and they grow quite a bit throughout the campaign. The central mystery/story is consistently engaging and well-written, even if it can be predictable at times.

     <em>

     , another disappointing DC game with a passable story that is elevated by 4-player co-op. Honestly,

  Based on the 5e,

  's combat does a great job of translating the tabletop game's rules and rhythm. The gameplay is comfortably the project's strongest feature, along with a robust character creator that gives players plenty of room to experiment with classes. While nothing too amazing,

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is a great single-player open-world game that features accessible but challenging combat, breathtaking visuals, a historical Japanese setting, and a pretty good story. While nothing too amazing, the latter is generally told well and features a strong range of secondary characters, most of whom have bigger personalities than Jin, the protagonist.
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  is fantastic, but the standard story does not support co-op.

  Fortunately, Sucker Punch eventually released
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  , a multiplayer mode that has enough content to feel like a fully fleshed project in its own right. Although not completely removed from Jin's story and Mongol invasion,
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  adds a mythological element, casting players as resurrected warriors who come back to take on an Oni uprising. The premise is, admittedly, a bit fantastical and far-fetched compared to the fairly grounded central story; however, it is told with the same sense of gravitas and top-tier presentation.

  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  is split into four modes, and most people will likely spend their time in Survival. This option allows four players to engage in PvE co-op to defeat wave after wave of enemies and protect three regions. While fun and replayable, Survival has no plot; consequently, if some narrative drive is what someone is seeking, they will need to check out Story. This mode features 10 arcs that are split into three chapters each, and they tell fairly self-contained tales that are similar to
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  's side quests, albeit with a supernatural twist. Although not amazing, the stories are relatively fun and do not overstay their welcome.

  The
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games are always reliable options when it comes to lighthearted co-op games, and
  <em>
   The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  is a contender for the best in the franchise. Covering all nine main movies, the campaign is chock-full of content, Easter eggs, and unlockable characters. Die-hard
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fans should get a kick out of seeing this humorous but still quite authentic adaptation; conversely, people who are not that into the sci-fi property should still find something to enjoy in this gorgeous adventure.

  As part of the "Ascension" update,
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  added co-op, permitting up to two players to combine forces. Only online co-op is supported, and the feature is activated once someone dies for the first time. After that point, that person will be able to host a public or private session from Selene's crash site; alternatively, they can join a cycle. Co-op does not significantly change the
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  experience, although the game's difficulty is ramped up to make up for the fact there are two Selenes.

  A rogue-like,

  follows a scout who lands on an alien planet and becomes stuck in a time loop. Delivering quite an emotional storyline that complements the premise and gameplay, Housemarque's title is among the

  What constitutes a good story? Does it have to be deep? Emotional? Nuanced or epic? Or, does it just have to be entertaining? Now, even more so than movies, video game stories can be tricky to accurately rate since a campaign can be extremely fun despite having a terrible narrative.
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is a bit of a special situation since it cannot be recommended specifically for its story, but it can 100% be recommended for its co-op campaign. Putting aside all the online content designed to keep people coming back for more,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's shining achievement is its bombastic story mode that delivers epic visuals and a great sense of scale.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":14,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":14,"nbrPlacementsScanned":14,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1141} -->

 <p>
  While more than playable alone, the campaign is far better alongside two friends, just because they are likely to be way more useful than AI partners. Together, three Space Marines should have a blast destroying Tyranid armies across an array of planets, and that's all the game has to offer to be a success. Fortunately,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  goes the extra mile by supplying a competent story with some character growth for the protagonist (Titus), even if the writing is generally quite simple and straightforward.

 <p>
  More importantly,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  nails the feeling of being in a war. Throughout the campaign, players will find themselves regularly looking over expansive battlefields defined by destruction and death, and it is both awe-inspiring and horrifying. The protagonist has to be fairly secure in their beliefs as otherwise the story wouldn't work, but there is just enough depth to be worth following rather than just ignoring.

  It's a joy to run through with a friend, and the story is heartwarming, to say the least. This is the perfect thing to pop in for a relaxing night on the couch. It's a great little indie-style gem hidden among the bigger co-op offerings.

  Gearbox's
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has been delivering fun co-op first-person shooter mayhem for over a decade, and all the entries are a blast in their own right. The first entry to debut directly on the PS5,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is a spin-off that builds upon the ideas of
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep
  </em>
  , a
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  DLC. Set within the world of a tabletop game, players create a character and then go on a comical adventure to stop the Dragon Lord.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  has awesome gunplay, comfortably the best in the series so far. The story does not take itself all that seriously, and while the humor is hit-and-miss, the spin-off is more consistently charming than some of the franchise's recent main entries. The overall narrative is rather forgettable, but the minute-to-minute writing is generally solid. This is an easy recommendation for fans of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  or anyone looking for a lighthearted FPS set in a fantastical universe.

  Set in a small town that appears unspectacular but, in reality, has a long and dense history,

  's implementation of 8-player co-op is unique as well, with the group voting to determine each character's actions.

  Roughly a month after coming out on PC,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  made its way to the PS5, and Larian's project survived the transition in one piece. Based on
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  , the RPG delivers in nearly every area, be it combat, customization, storytelling, or co-op support. The latter highlights
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's tabletop origins since players can set up a co-op campaign save file that they revisit as a group; obviously, this can be quite a commitment, so the game also offers new players the chance to join existing playthroughs.

 <p>
  Set in a vast and complex world, Larian created a deep RPG that emphasizes player choice, particularly in its secondary content. The turn-based combat system can be initially overwhelming if someone is not familiar with the studio's previous releases, but it is rewarding in the long run. In co-op, players are allowed and even encouraged to do their own thing and decide when they want to come together.

  If horror is a group's genre of choice, then they cannot go wrong when it comes to Supermassive Games. The developer has carved out a niche for itself in the co-op interactive drama market, with
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  chapters all being dependable picks. 2022's
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  is another feather in the studio's cap, and it supports up to 8 players in both local and online co-op.

  An ode to 1980s slashers,
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  wears its inspiration on its sleeve. As tends to be the case with these sorts of stories, the game finds a group of teenagers heading out to the eponymous location with plans to spend the night. Things quickly go wrong, and one of them might be responsible for the mayhem. Depending on how many people are playing the game,
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  could just assign a single character to every player, which will force everyone to decide whether they will prioritize self-preservation over what is good for the collective.

  Developed by Hazelight Studios, a company whose primary focus is co-op experiences,
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  is a deeply emotional story of a little girl coping with her parents' divorce by playing with hand-made rag dolls that resemble her mom and dad. The girl's tears falling on the dolls trap her parents' souls inside the toys, and they become the two-player characters.

  Players will have to travel through magical realms that are a reflection of the parents' positive memories of one another. By solving environmental puzzles and completing platforming challenges, they attempt to mend their broken relationship and get back into their own bodies. From the gameplay perspective, it's a fun, challenging platformer that relies heavily on cooperation between players. However, it is its creative, unique narrative that makes this game a truly essential title to play on the PS5.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  has launched a brand-new in-game event for a limited time, offering players the chance to farm valuable Planar Ornaments even faster. The popular sci-fi RPG from HoYoverse features a wide variety of ways for players to power up their character, with several different items to pick up.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  ’s Light Cones offer powerful bonuses, often catered to a character’s specific playstyle, while Relics offer more general buffs that can benefit many characters. Now, HoYoverse has rolled out its newest Planar Ornament-focused event.

  Planar Ornaments serve as a parallel to
  <em>

  ’s Relics, though how players can acquire them differs wildly. Planar Ornaments offer
  <em>

  players an array of powerful buffs, though access to the extra Relics is limited to specific areas. The main method for farming Planar Ornaments is through the Simulated Universe game mode, with Planar Ornaments available as a reward for clearing Elite stages in the game. HoYoverse is now giving fans a new way to farm Planar Ornaments even easier with its newest event.

  Without Cash in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Piece
  </em>
  , it is impossible to progress. All players start their journey with only their fists as weapons, but to get Fruits, Techniques, or weapons — such as a katana — you will have to pay quite a lot of money. Therefore, earning currency should be your main task. To farm a lot of money fast, you must fight bosses in

  Although there are way more regular enemies, they drop ridiculously small amounts of Cash. At the same time, bosses drop a lot of Cash and rare loot upon death. It is important to note that simply farming bosses will also not bring you a lot of Cash. Therefore, players should always accept the appropriate quest before a boss battle. This will reward you with much more EXP and Cash in

 <p>
  As expected in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  RPG games, you need to have a high enough level to take on quests and fight bosses. So, to farm Cash in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Piece
  </em>
  , you have to fight bosses that suit your current level over and over again. Once you are strong enough, move on to the next boss.

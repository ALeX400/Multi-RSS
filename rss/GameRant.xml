  The fast-food chain McDonald's is teaming up with Sega and Paramount with a new line of toys based on the upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic the Hedgehog 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  film set to hit theaters later this month on December 20. While there is no information yet about when the
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  toys might make their way to North American locations, it seems likely that they will, given previous tie-ins with the franchise.

  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  is one of the most anticipated films of this year, as previous trailers and casting announcements, such as Keanu Reeves as Shadow, have drummed up significant hype among fans. The film continues to expand the franchise with new and returning characters, with many believing it will adapt various elements and plotlines from the fan-favorite game
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  <em>

 <p>
  Now, fans can get another look at the upcoming film in the form of a Colombian advertisement for a series of McDonald's toys depicting the film's main characters as part of an official collaboration. The short commercial shows the main characters of
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, alongside Shadow delivering Happy Meals before revealing multiple small figures based on the characters.

  The toy line depicts Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow in multiple poses within a plastic ring, though it is unclear what their playable function might look like, so fans might have to pick up a Happy Meal to find out. In addition to the base versions of each main character, the toys also feature versions based on Super Sonic and Super Shadow, lending credence to the idea that the film may be adapting elements from

  Sega's iconic mascot has been on the rise this year, with fans largely praising the recent release of
  <em>
   Sonic x Shadow Generations
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  an expanded remaster of one of Sonic's most acclaimed titles. While much of Sega's output of
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games has been met with inconsistent critical reception in the past, the ongoing film franchise's success has seemingly proven the series' lasting legacy in the public eye.

  This is far from the only time McDonald's has crossed over with major gaming franchises in some form, either, as the fast food chain has previously offered toys and merchandise based on the

  characters.

  A new sci-fi life sim with strong
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  vibes called
  <em>
   Ekoh Beach
  </em>
  has been announced for
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  , and it seems like an excellent option for gamers who want some variety after playing the popular farming sim for years. Steam has seen no shortage of excellent life sims in the last few years, and this game is the latest one to promise fans of the genre a good time with a unique setting.

  Ever since
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  was released and exploded in popularity in 2016, the life simulation genre has become increasingly popular. In recent years, gamers have seen excellent examples of games like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , going from more traditional ones like
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  to others such as
  <em>
   Mirthwood

  Now, Zenland Games has announced that
  <em>
   Ekoh Beach
  </em>
  will be released on Steam on April 4, 2025. The game will be set in Ekoh 99, a tropical town on a distant planet that was destroyed by a robot rebellion. Instead of taking care of a farm like in most games in the life simulation genre,
  <em>
   Ekoh Beach
  </em>
  puts the player in the shoes of the city planner, having to engage in several activities, such as exploring mines, forests, and beaches, gathering resources, harvesting materials, rebuilding houses, and more. During the game, players will have unique items such as the Z-Cleaner to scoop up mineral-rich particles to use in rebuilding the town. Also,
  <em>
   Ekoh Beach
  </em>
  features over 35 NPCs that the player can build relationships with as they get to know Ekoh 99.

  Ekoh Beach is not the only recent game to look like a sci-fi version of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , though. Earlier this year,
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Farlands
  </em>
  was released on Steam. The title also incorporated the classic pixelated style of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  into its aesthetic, and like
  <em>
   Ekoh Beach
  </em>
  , it was set on an alien planet. However, the recent game seemed to have a bigger emphasis on farming and also allowed the player to create their own spaceship, which could be customized in several different ways.

 <p>
  A reliable source in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  community has revealed that Ifa will be a 4-Star character from Tlalocan, set to make his playable debut in a future update. While
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has introduced major quality-of-life changes in Natlan, its treatment of male characters in 2024 left a lot to be desired. Kinich remains the sole 5-Star male character released in 2024, and given that Natlan isn't expected to release any additional male characters after Ifa, it's safe to assume that 2025 is going to be more of the same.

 <p>
  From a gameplay standpoint, male characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  tend to be hypercarries rather than support units. While Ororon was recently released in Version 5.2 as a 4-Star Electro Support, players need to go all the way back to Version 3.6 to find another example in Baizhu – who is a 5-Star Dendro Support. This lack of variety in gameplay, as well as a general lack of 5-Star male characters, has caused some resentment in the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  community.

 <p>
  With Kinich and Ororon being the only male characters released in Natlan thus far, many
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players were hoping that Ifa would salvage the situation. However, as revealed by Full Stop Chan via hxg_diluc, Ifa will be a 4-Star character from the Flower-Feather Clan. His weapon type and element are currently unknown, but as a Saurian veterinarian, it's likely that he will play the role of a Support. Ifa was indirectly confirmed as playable thanks to the upcoming weekly boss in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , as Xiuhcoatl's voice lines contain unique lines for both Ifa and Varesa.

  With Ayano expected to release in Version 5.4 as a new

While the most common assumption places Iansan as a 5-Star character, Ororon and Citlali have proven that being one of the six Heroes of Natlan does not guarantee one's rarity.

 <p>
  That being said, if the Collective of Plenty zone is released in Version 5.5, it means that
  <em>

  will have to debut either Iansan or Varesa for the new exploration ability. With Ifa being a 4-Star character in
  <em>

  </em>
  , it's highly likely that he will launch alongside whoever ends up being the featured 5-Star of Version 5.5. Players will find out more in the coming months, as Version 5.5 is set to be released on March 26, 2025.

  Blizzard has confirmed that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is crossing over with
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  as part of the game's Season 14 content.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 is set to go live on December 10, with its headlining new addition being none other than the game's new Tank hero, Hazard.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  gave fans the chance to try Hazard on a trial basis recently, letting them try out the new hero's abilities and see how he pairs with other characters on the roster. While fans have been mixed on Hazard's design, many seem to have enjoyed his ability kit. Hazard will be introduced to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  proper on December 10 when Season 14 starts, but he's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hero shooter's new season.

 <p>
  Blizzard has revealed a new trailer for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  that shows off what the studio has planned for Season 14. Besides Hazard, who is bringing a makeover to the Oasis map's spawn rooms,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14 will also feature a Mythic Thor Reinhardt Skin and a new Premium Battle Pass that includes an Odin Sigma skin, Celestial Mei skin, and Hazard's Mobster skin. Other Norse mythology skins will also be available, plus there will be fresh skins to purchase in the shop as well. The end of the trailer teased a crossover with
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  , and since a Venture skin was previously promised for Season 14, speculation is that the character will be represented as part of the collab, though that has yet to be confirmed.

  is bringing back 6v6 on an experimental basis from December 17 to January 6, with a different 6v6 experiment scheduled for later in the season. Considering how much the community has been championing for the return of 6v6, it will be interesting to see how they react when it's actually implemented in the game.

   Online games have become one of the most popular ways to enjoy the medium, as they can be played with friends or partners without making them leave the comfort of their own sofa or desk. Modern couples can now even make a date out of it by enjoying a two-player cooperative game, instead of meeting up to watch a movie or for dinner. This list already contained a multitude of titles across many genres, so there was already something for everyone, but there are still many more titles that may be overlooked by gamer couples.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Dark Pictures Anthology
   </em>
  </strong>
  implemented a game mode known as 'Movie Mod,' in which players would pass a controller back and forth after each chapter so that two players in the same place could play the game together. Though this is not an official implementation in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players can still make the mode work by passing over the controller at the start of each chapter.

 <p>
  This way, two partners have sway over the outcome of the game. They can either work together to gain their desired outcome by carefully selecting choices or let the chips fall where they may and see what kind of ending it leads to.

  Dating sims are normally a single-player affair, placing an emphasis on characters and story that doesn't really leave much room for a multiplayer implementation. But the developers at Beautiful Glitch showed everyone how it was meant to be done with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Prom
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

  In this game, players choose one of four monsters who are scrambling to find their perfect date for prom from one of the eligible characters available. They must choose their actions and words carefully, or they will be left to attend prom alone. Players have the option to help or hinder their partner and their romantic endeavors, adding a layer of hilarity and chaos to this clearly hilariously chaotic game.

  For couples that are not looking for a cozy/cutesy game but something that packs more of a punch,
  <em>
   <strong>
    A Way Out
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the perfect title. Two prisoners, Leo and Vincent, are attempting a jailbreak and to escape the authorities so they can enjoy their freedom. But breaking out of prison is no small feat, so teamwork is essential to ensure their plans come to fruition.

 <p>
  What makes
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  special is that the game is specifically designed for two players — there is no single player option. The only way to play is local or online split screen, so even if the gamers are far apart, they will share a screen. There are plenty of times players will need to coordinate their efforts, such as one player distracting an NPC while the other grabs a set of keys, which makes it perfect for couples to flex just how harmonious their relationship is.

  There is likely not a gamer alive by now who hasn't tried their hand at the blocky sandbox survival game that is
  <strong>
   <em>

There are hours of fun to be had, and countless gaming dates that can be spent here. And with its low requirements, and the classic
  <em>

  available for free, there is no excuse not to try this title out for date night.

  Gamers are likely used to 2D platformers that require them to save a Princess thanks to the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game series, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castle Crashers

  For couples who love high-octane action and frantic gun gameplay,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Left 4 Dead
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the ideal game for them. They will assume the role of one of the four survivors who are attempting to escape the zombie-ridden city to safety, but there is an army's worth of undead between them and their escape route.

 <p>
  Large crowds of zombies and special infected make this game more fun than a standard run-of-the-mill zombie game, which is sure to make for a fun date night. What's more, there is Steam workshop support, so players can customize their game for even more unique fun.

  Before
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , Larian was known for
  <em>
   Divinity
  </em>
  , an RPG series with a unique world bursting with interesting lore, monsters, and NPCs.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Original Sin 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a marked improvement on the original with improved graphics and a story that is sure to suck the players in and keep them gripped right until the unpredictable finale.

 <p>
  Though the party will normally consist of four, there is nothing stopping a couple from taking two NPCs with them or braving the world and its dangers with just the two of them. Whatever way they choose, the couple is sure to have fun, but the twist finale may just start a lovers' spat.

  Even months after its release,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still a hot topic among gamers, especially following the addition of Honour Mode. It follows the story of a number of people infected by Mind Flayer tadpoles who set out on a quest to find a way to cleanse themselves of that infection.

 <p>
  As with past Larian Studios RPGs, players can play with up to three more players and embark on a quest of epic proportions together. It is the perfect game for fantasy-loving couples to enjoy together, and it can definitely occupy couples for much more than just one night.

  This multiplayer horror game has withstood the test of time even as other titles in the genre crumbled, which is a testament to its devoted fanbase. Thanks to securing licenses to famous franchises such as
  <em>
   Halloween
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Scream
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead by Daylight
   </em>
  </strong>
  has garnered horror fans far and wide to come together to take the roles of either survivors or killers.

  is a collection of horror games made by Supermassive Games that follow the same format as their flagship game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Until Dawn

  </em>
  . The entire first season of
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures

  Cooperatively, players will control different characters through each scene, and each can make choices to influence the direction of the game, allowing couples to craft the story as both of them wish. If couples should ever meet up in real life, they can enjoy Movie Night mode, in which two players share one controller and take turns playing the game.

  Players craft an avatar with a limited but fun selection of character customization options and then load into the themed rooms in which they must discover clues, solve puzzles, and escape. The puzzles are challenging enough that players won't breeze through but not too difficult that it would lead to a quarrel.

  Horror fans haven't been forgotten about, and there are many cooperative games that will scare the holy living heck out of them.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Phasmophobia
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one such game, which revolves around a cast of blank characters who work as ghost hunters. They must infiltrate a chosen map, house, farmhouse, school, prison, and others with their ghost-hunting equipment to determine what sort of entity haunts the premise, but they should take care not to become its next victim.

   <em>
    Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a space-based shooter game. The forces of Anti-Love are threatening the known universe. To combat this, the player and up to three friends must work together to collectively navigate their psychedelic neon spaceship through the galaxy, encountering threats along the way. Each level layout is randomized, so players will explore new areas each time they play.

 <p>
  <em>
   Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime
  </em>
  is perfect for couples, not just because of the name. The player and their partner must communicate to navigate the shared controls of their ship. Each player must perform equally important duties, like controlling the turrets or the ship’s shields or being in charge of the GPS systems. It can be easy to simply relinquish the controls to the other player, but in this game, that can get quite hectic. This game offers players a great way to develop teamwork and communication skills.

  Playing
  <em>
   Heave Ho

  with a partner can be pure chaos. Players can grip onto each other, putting their full faith and trust in one another. Of course, this can lead to complete trolling and total carnage in what can be described as the ultimate
  <em>
   Lion King
  </em>
  /Mufasa betrayal. If they’re feeling brave, players can attempt to coordinate their momentum to try and swing their wobbling combined rope-like limbs across the map. Luckily, the respawn time is almost instantaneous.

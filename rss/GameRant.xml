      <title>10 Best Open-World Games With Realistic Ways To Fast Travel</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While there is no doubt that it can make getting to specific locations much quicker, fast travel can easily break the immersion of an open-world, especially when it's as simple as opening the map and immediately teleporting to a location. When games implement
  <strong>
   realistic ways to fast travel
  </strong>
  , it becomes much easier to believe the world that the developers have worked hard to create.

 <p>
  This list includes some of the
  <strong>
   best open-world games
  </strong>
  that discard the all-too-easy ways to fast travel in favor of offering players more logical ways to traverse. Some even have cutscenes or are more convoluted to do, encouraging players to slow down and explore rather than getting caught in the trap of speedily plowing through the game.

  The third main game in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Morrowind,
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set in Vvardenfell, where Gods and fantasy races struggle for power. In terms of RPGs,
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  is relatively harder to get into, with no quest markers or stat regeneration, but it has a lot of lore and amazing world-building.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the
  <em>
   TES
  </em>
  games that followed,
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  did not make fast traveling straightforward, but the options players do have are innovative and make sense within the world. They can
  <strong>
   ride silt striders and boats, use teleportation magic, and seek assistance from Guild guides
  </strong>
  . These methods all take different routes, so players also have to think about the best way to reach their destination.

    Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a sequel to the second game, and the second game in the
  <em>
   Ezio Trilogy.
  </em>
  The player continues to try and free Rome from the Borgia's control and reclaim the Apple of Eden from the Templars, all while rebuilding both the city and the Brotherhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  A fair amount of the optional content revolves around restoring Rome, from repairing aqueducts to buying landmarks to opening shops. In order to fast travel between districts, the player
  <strong>
   must unlock tunnels to use
  </strong>
  ; if the tunnel is not purchased for a particular district, they won't be able to use it. Fortunately, the franchise is known for its fun free-running mechanics.

  As many players await the long-anticipated release of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , many continue to enjoy the open worlds of the previous titles. Like
  <em>
   GTA5'
  </em>
  s story mode,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto Online
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes place in the LA-inspired Los Santos. As a multiplayer sandbox, there is plenty of mischief to be had, whether it's racing, stealing, or gambling.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are plenty of both regular and over-the-top ways to get around in
  <em>
   GTAO
  </em>
  , on land and water, and in the sky. By hailing or
  <strong>
   using the in-game mobile phone to call a taxi
  </strong>
  , players can jump in, choose a location, and select "Trip Skip" - a much more interactive way to fast travel.

  By now,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been thoroughly rinsed by most gamers for its memorable world and character creation possibilities. Although the game does make it incredibly easy to fast travel, with players being able to travel to any discovered location from pretty much anywhere, there are other, more immersive ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Using carriages near each city's stables
  </strong>
  allows the player to get a ride to any of the other cities, regardless of whether they've been there before or not. It's a great method to use when roleplaying as a traveling merchant or weary warrior. Players will also need to take a boat ride to get to Solstheim if they have the
  <em>
   Dragonborn
  </em>
  DLC.

  The fourth main game in the iconic post-apocalyptic series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  follows the Sole Survivor's journey through America's divided wastelands to find their son, with plenty of fighting, crafting, leveling, and base-building in between. Outside of Survival Difficulty, players can fast travel to known locations via the map, though there are more immersive ways to get around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throwing a vertibird signal grenade in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  will
  <strong>
   summon the US-developed military aircraft, the vertibird, for the player to ride.
  </strong>
  By choosing a place on the map, the vertibird will take them as close as possible, and, as an added bonus, will help fend off enemies if it lands near hostiles.

  follows the iconic Peter Parker as he faces notorious villains such as Doctor Octopus and Electro to save New York. The game is most renowned for its addictive web swinging and combat, with gameplay feeling as if it has weight and momentum, making traveling all the more fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players wanting a quicker way to get around, they only have to open the map and select an already-discovered location. However, the game
  <em>
  </em>
  includes a cutscene of
  <strong>
   Spider-Man riding the subway
  </strong>
  . Not only does this add to the realism and remind players of Parker's normality, it's also a humorous change of pace from swinging through the city.

   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the bigger indie games to come out of 2025, and will no doubt be nominated for many Game of the Year awards. Its in-depth mechanics and RPG elements, historical accuracies, and charismatic characters all combine into an engrossing experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fast travel is possible in
  <em>
   KCD2,
  </em>
  though not without its risks and, unlike most games, it's not instantaneous. The player can see Henry's journey and the passing of time on the map, and on the way, they may
  <strong>
   encounter random events
  </strong>
  . This could be anything from bandits to campsites; players can stop off at (or take a chance at running from) these points along the way if they choose.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Witcher 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  likely needs no introduction, being part of a franchise that also includes books and series, and one of the best-selling RPGs of all time. Players must fight monsters and people to save both Ciri and the world from the Wild Hunt's invasion, amid an already war-torn Continent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can fast travel within and between kingdoms
  <strong>
   using discovered signposts
  </strong>
  , but one of the more realistic ways is
  <strong>
   sailing
  </strong>
  . When aboard a boat, players can choose an anchor-marked dock to fast travel to. Using this method adds a bit more limitation, which also contributes to the role-playing potential - just imagine Geralt, the legendary monster-hunting sailor.

  As open-world games go,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
   </strong>
  </em>
  is among the best when it comes to size, amount of content, and gameplay, and the franchise's first real venture into the genre doesn't compromise the classic
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  vibes. The title follows Snake as he navigates a warring Afghanistan, with an overarching plot about revenge, and plenty of missions that can be approached however the player chooses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  has one of the most unique fast travel systems. Players have to
  <strong>
   hide under a box in a loading zone
  </strong>
  in order for a truck to pick them up. The trucks can transport Snake to any other delivery points, provided they have been unlocked by collecting their respective invoice.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of Rockstar's biggest achievements to date. The game follows the outlaw Arthur Morgan and his rogue family, the Van Der Linde gang, as they attempt to escape the law and find the funds to hang up their guns for good. From a narrative standpoint,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  excels, which is only enhanced by the realistic physics and visuals of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is, admittedly, slower-paced than a lot of open-world games that are keen to throw the player into the wild and explore, but for patient gamers, this is a great opportunity to fully indulge in the world. There are various stage-coaches and train stations across the map that can be used to fast travel between places, requiring the player to go through the whole works of buying a ticket and watching a cutscene. While not the fastest of fast travel, it's one of the most cinematic and era-appropriate.

  A subtle touch of realism from

  Story Mode is furniture and how it gets dirty or wears down over time. Players will notice their furniture pieces getting tears or scuffs, but they don't necessarily have to replace them when this happens.
  <strong>
   Instead, they can save money by Refurbishing furniture.

  Players have a lot of creative freedom and control when building in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  . Under each furniture category, various pieces can be customized with textures and a color wheel, allowing players to create unique and cohesive furniture sets.
 </p>
 <p>
  They can also use an AI feature to generate new textures or use the 3D printer to create objects using photos. After players decorate and live in their builds, furniture gets dirty and deteriorates. A messy environment can cause Zois to feel Uncomfortable or even get sick.

  Players can increase their Zoi's Housework skill by doing the following:

  <li>
   Washing dishes

  When Zois reach Housework level two, they can Refurbish objects to increase their skill.

   <strong>
    Additionally, the only way to fix deteriorating objects is to Refurbish them.

   To Refurbish an object, click on it and scroll down to the Refurbish interaction.

  Zois must pay Meows to Refurbish an object, and the price varies depending on the item and the extent of damage.

   Players must replace these items in Build Mode or by visiting the Furniture Store.

   Zois can also practice Housework using the Furniture Workbench and 3D Printer, which can be purchased in Build Mode.
  </strong>
  A common bug causes players to get stuck when using the Workbench, but they can
  <strong>
   Emergency Rescue their Zois from the tutorial book.
  </strong>
  Then, players should reload the game to reset it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zois that are Uncomfortable have a hard time with chores and may refuse to do them or take longer to finish. Zois can also have Traits or Values that make household work more manageable. Those with the Safety Value will enjoy cleaning, may enter a Concentrated or Tranquil mood, and get a boost to their skill gain.

  <strong>
   Custom Deliveries
  </strong>
  are special crafting and gathering questlines helmed by certain NPCs throughout each expansion that provide numerous benefits to players. Not only do they give copious amounts of leveling experience to whichever crafter or gatherer you choose along with crafting/gathering
  <strong>
   Scrips
  </strong>
  , but there are also various enticing material rewards to collect for your efforts, from mounts to glamours.
 </p>
 <p>
  These questlines involve acquiring different collectable-type goods requested by the respective NPC client during any given week. Again, they can be crafted or gathered with any qualifying job you have, as long as that job meets the minimum level requirement.
  <strong>
   Collectables
  </strong>
  are a unique type of item with their own system of procurement that involves using special abilities to manifest the highest quality of that item possible. The higher its quality score, the greater the rewards you'll receive in return.

 <p>
  To unlock the ability to gather Collectables in the game, you first need to complete the
  <strong>
   'Inscrutable Tastes'
  </strong>
  Level 50 quest, which you pick up from
  <strong>
   Morgayne
  </strong>
  in Isghard's Foundation at (X:10.1, Y:10.4). This will also lead you to other quests that allow you to unlock Scrip Exchange points in subsequent expansions, starting with Idyllshire in
  <em>
   Heavensward
  </em>
  . You will also need them to unlock access to these Custom Delivery clients by unlocking that expansion's inventory of special collectible items.
 </p>
 <p>
  The quests you need include the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Inscrutable Tastes
   </strong>
   (Level 50) - Morgayne in Foundation (X:10.1, Y:10.4)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    No Longer a Collectable
   </strong>
   (Level 56) - Lydirlona in Mor Dhona (X:22.3, Y:6.8)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Go West, Craftsman
   </strong>
   (Level 60) - Lydirlona in Mor Dhona (X:22.3, Y:6.8)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Reach Long and Prosper
   </strong>
   (Level 60) - Galiena in Rhalgr's Reach (X:9.8, Y:12.5)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Boutique Always Winds
   </strong>
   (Level 70) - Mowen in Eulmore (X:11.4, Y:10.7)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Expanding House of Splendors
   </strong>
   (Level 80) - Ofpilona in Radz-at-Han (X:11.7, Y:9.6)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Dawn of a New Deal
   </strong>
   (Level 90) - Rhodina in Solution Nine (X:9.2, Y:13.4)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Each week, the NPC client will ask for different items, which will vary depending on the job. The more collectable items you bring them, your reputation with them will improve via a Satisfaction Gauge. Once it reaches a certain threshold, you'll gain a new level of trust with the client and more opportunities to acquire different items for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you reach the final stage of their Satisfaction Gauge, you'll usually receive a grand reward for all your efforts, such as a mount or a full glamour set. What's more, they'll often give you permission to dress them in a glamour of your choosing for future deliveries.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's latest Patch 7.2 update, there are currently
  <strong>
   11 different Custom Delivery clients
  </strong>
  that you can work with, across all expansions from
  <em>
   Heavensward
  </em>
  up to
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  . Each client has their own requirements for participating in their questlines, so make sure your character is properly leveled and equipped before seeking them out. You may also need to reach a certain point in the respective expansion's MSQ (Main Scenario Questline) before they become accessible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember, unlike Allied Society questlines (aka "Beast Tribes"), which can span across all job types in the game, Custom Deliveries are exclusively for crafters and gatherers.

      <title>All Schedule 1 Cheats and Console Commands</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/schedule-1-console-commands-cheat-codes-item-ids/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There's a ton of fun to be had with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Schedule 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  , particularly when using cheats. With console commands, players can completely transform the experience, either by giving themselves an unlimited amount of money and products or by altering the intensity with which law enforcement pursues them.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Although enabling
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  cheats is relatively straightforward, figuring out how to use one or two of them can be a little tricky. To do so, players will need to know the correct item IDs for the drugs and furniture they want to give themselves, the best of which can be found a little further down the page.

 <p>
  Before players can use
  <em>
   Schedule I
  </em>
  cheats, they'll first need to enable the console, which they can do from the Settings menu. Under the Game tab, they'll find an option for the Console, which can be toggled on and off via a circular radio button. After enabling cheats, players should
  <strong>
   exit the Settings menu
  </strong>
  and then press the tilde key (`) to bring up the console. From there, it's a simple case of typing in one of the
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  cheats listed below and then hitting enter.

  All of the cheats in
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  can be useful, but the most important one is arguably Give. With Give, players can get just about any item in the game, from drugs and ingredients to furniture and hardware. To use the Give console command, players should type in the name of the item that they want without any spaces, like
  <strong>
   give mixingstationmk2
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   give cocaine 20
  </strong>
  . Item IDs for some of the most useful items and products in
  <em>
   Schedule 1
  </em>
  can be found below.

 <p>
  To participate in the City Racers mini-game, fans will need an event-exclusive currency: Flag Tokens. The event features a special dice, and you can roll that dice with your flags. Each roll requires 20 Flag Tokens. You have the option to increase your score using your roll multiplier. For example, a 5x multiplier will multiply your score by 5, but it will use up 100 flags.
 </p>
 <p>
  As mentioned above, you can play this minigame solo, but we recommend teaming up if you want the best rewards. Team rewards include the Wild Sticker and a five-star sticker pack, and solo rewards only offer a four-star and three-star sticker pack. Completing laps in City Racers will also reward you with items like Flag Tokens, stickers, and free dice.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the City Racers minigame, you've got one day to form your teams, and after that, you’ll be racing daily. There are three races in total, and your rank in each one determines how many points you earn. The third race gives the most points, so a smart strategy is to save your Flag tokens and go all-in for it.

    Pokemon Legends: Z-A

  </strong>
  is finally here, and it includes a total of 26 new Mega Evolutions for players to toy with as they progress through the game. Each Mega Evolution in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  has its merits, and while players may choose which ones to use based on looks or personal preference, these critters were not all born equal.

  Knowing which Megas are good or mediocre can also help with choosing a starter in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , as all three first partner Pokemon get a new Mega Evolution. Some of them are balanced and can be great assets, but others are mediocre at best.

  S-Tier Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mega Chandelure

 </ul>
 <p>
  Much to the surprise of many fans, Mega Starmie may be
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's best Mega Evolution, as it's available fairly early in the game, and it has great stats as well as move coverage. With 660 base stat total (BST), which is the third-highest among new Megas, Starmie is a powerful hybrid attacker with very high Speed to boot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chandelure is very similar, as it has an incredibly high Sp. Attack stat at 175, and a good BST of 620 that gives it good defenses and Speed. With powerful moves and decent coverage against other types, Mega Chandelure stands taller than most Mega Evolutions in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mega Skarmory only has a BST of 565, but it's incredibly optimized, as it has 40 Sp. Attack, and then high stats in every other department, with a staggering 140 Attack stat and very high defenses and Speed. Steel/Flying is a powerful Pokemon type combination with amazing defenses, and with good moves like Brave Bird and Iron Head, it can deal serious damage.

  's Zygarde is great already, but its Mega Evolution takes it to the next level. This Pokemon has an otherworldly 216 Sp. Attack stat, and it comes with the only new move in the game, called Nihil Light. This move deals massive damage regardless of the opponent's stat changes, and it also hits Fairy-types.

 </h2>
 <ul>

   <strong>
    Mega Barbaracle

   <strong>
    Mega Emboar
   </strong>
  </li>

  </li>

   <strong>
    Mega Scrafty
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Barbaracle is one of the few Mega Evolutions with a new type in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , as it loses its Water type in favor of Fighting. It has very high Attack and Defense, with an overall good bulk and decent Speed. With an ample selection of STAB moves and moves for coverage, Mega Barbaracle is an incredibly strong pick for any team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mega Emboar in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is not amazing, but it definitely packs a punch. It has very high Attack at 148, though its base Attack is 123, so it doesn't improve a lot. Yet, it has good stats and good STAB moves, and it resists various pesky types.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mega Excadrill's Attack stat is one of the highest in the game, sitting at 165, and it has good HP, defenses, and Speed. Combined with very powerful
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Ground moves and a good selection for Steel, too, it stands as a great addition - especially when considering its resistances.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  's Falinks is the only Gen 8 critter in the game, and coincidentally, it also gets a new Mega Evolution. Much like Emboar, it has very high Attack and Defense, and it has a respectable 100 Speed. While it only deals STAB damage with Fighting moves, Falinks has access to a vast array of coverage moves that make it strong against the types it's normally weak against.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's Mega Feraligatr doesn't move the needle much in terms of defense or offense when it comes to its new Water/Dragon combo, but it has an eye-watering 160 Attack stat and some great moves. Though its design has proven polarizing, it's arguably one of the best Megas in the game, and it's mostly held back by low HP and Speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eternal Flower Floette is an interesting case, as its BST is just one point lower than that of Florges, but its Mega Evolution gets those extra 100 points that make it very strong. It has very high Special Attack and Special Defense, but it's lackluster when it comes to coverage moves. As a Fairy-type Pokemon, though, it's incredibly strong.

 <p>
  Hawlucha was one of the few publicly announced Mega Evolutions for the game. While the base Pokemon is nothing too impressive, Mega Hawlucha has very good stats combined with respectable moves and coverage, taking this Fighting/Flying critter to new heights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mega Scrafty in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  was basically confirmed with it being Naveen's ace, and now that it's out, it doesn't disappoint. With a bulk of 135 Defense and Special Defense, alongside 130 Attack, Mega Scrafty can be the cherry on top for every team, which is further proven by its coverage moves and access to the stat-boosting move Bulk Up.

 <p>
  Mega Clefable's new Fairy/Flying type in
  <em>
   PLZA
  </em>
  is interesting, giving it new avenues for damage and defense, but it falls a bit flat due to having just a few very good moves, and only Air Slash as a strong Flying-type attack. Despite being immune to both Dragon and Ground, with great defenses, it has subpar options for its moves that make it a mediocre Mega.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's Mega Dragonite has fantastic stats with a BST of 700, and while it's a good Pokemon overall, it's arguably a bit of a downgrade from the original. Mega Dragonite has lower Attack than the regular critter does, all while gaining a lot of Special Attack. However, its movepool is quite hybrid, making it just decent when compared to other Megas.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most bizarre designs goes to Mega Dragalge in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , which looks the part of a Ghost-type, but retains its original Poison/Dragon combo. Mega Dragalge has one of the highest values for Special Defense in the game, and it also has high Defense and Special Attack, but its 44 Speed leaves it far behind. In a game where Speed helps with cooldowns on all moves, Mega Dragalge is dead on arrival.

 <p>
  Drampa is in a similar spot as Dragalge, as it has an amazing Special Attack of 160 with a good bulk, but it only packs 36 Speed. This means that battles in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will not be as smooth as with other critters, making Mega Drampa just an OK pick overall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eelektross is also getting a Mega Evolution, and while its statline is impressive for a hybrid attacker, it has its fair share of flaws. Perhaps most notably, Mega Eelektross loses Levitate and Ground immunity due to
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  cutting Abilities. It does have access to decent moves, but with a slightly better-than-average bulk, it's not among the best Megas in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Froslass is the only new Ice-type Mega Evolution in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , and Ice is not a great type to begin with. It does have great Special Attack and a Speed stat of 120, but it's mediocre defensively due to resisting the three worst types in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's Mega Pyroar is mediocre overall, even though it has one of the highest values for Speed at 126. The main problem in this case is that Mega Pyroar lacks good moves and coverage to use in battle, making it a sub-par choice.

  Victreebel has one of the most fun designs among the new Megas. Although it has respectable stats, the main problem Mega Victreebel faces is that Grass and Poison are not amazing offensively, and with middling Speed, it fails to shine. It's also a hybrid attacker, which is not always a good thing,

  's Mega Meganium squanders its shot at making the Gen 2 starter a great critter. Despite having amazing stats and gaining Fairy as a secondary type, Mega Meganium leaves a lot to be desired with its movepool, which only has a few viable attacks for both Grass and Fairy. With very little coverage and a 4x weakness to Poison, Mega Meganium is not it.

  Mega Scolipede is another strange case where its identity is being changed considerably, like in Mega Dragonite's case.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  went through significant changes in 2025, changing the tier system to include Essential, Premium, Ultimate, and PC. If you want 500+ Xbox games and Day One releases, you will need to subscribe to the Ultimate tier, which is $29.99/month. Premium offers 200+ games, but new Xbox releases will be added within a year rather than immediately. PC-only comes with its own games and offers Day One releases.

  Whether you are a new or old subscriber, you are probably contemplating whether to invest in Game Pass or not, especially since it is no longer a no-brainer. However, if you are looking to play some
  <strong>
   Xbox crossplay games
  </strong>
  , the subscription service still has you well-covered, offering plenty of games in Premium, Ultimate, and PC.

  This is weird.
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  is on a PlayStation console. That just doesn't sound right, does it? Well, that is the timeline we live in, and there are certainly positives to this development. For one, Game Pass subscribers who boot up
  <em>
   Gears of War: Reloaded
  </em>
  will be joining a wider playerbase than ever before, which should help keep the remaster's PvP modes alive for quite a long time. Secondly, you can now play through the 2-player co-op campaign with a friend who does not own an Xbox or a PC, creating a union that would have seemed inconceivable just a few years ago.

    <p>
     <em>
      Gears of War: Reloaded
     </em>
     supports full crossplay between Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.

 <p>
  Now, is
  <em>
   Reloaded
  </em>
  worth playing? If somebody has never experienced
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  , they should give this version a try. While the third-person shooter gameplay feels dated at this point, it is still satisfying, and the campaign is paced well to ensure that most encounters do not overstay their welcome. If you have no interest in the online portion, the single-player (or co-op) story is 100% worth experiencing. If you have played the game to death already, you might just want to try the multiplayer modes.

  Obsidian's announcement of
  <em>
   Grounded 2
  </em>
  came as a bit of a surprise, just because it did not seem like the developer was winding down the first game. Yet, the sequel is now part of Game Preview and Steam Early Access, and it is a solid evolution of its predecessor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set in a park rather than a backyard,
  <em>
   Grounded 2
  </em>
  very much feels like "
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  but bigger and better," although it does come with a few rough edges that should be ironed out during the development process. The sequel emphasizes customization way more than the original title, so you can go out of your way to put a personal touch on your character. If you have played
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  , the sequel's gameplay loop will not hold too many surprises, as it is still ultimately a survival game that prioritizes crafting; however, it is shaping up to be a pretty awesome successor.

  Despite making its full debut on July 22, 2025,
  <em>
   Abiotic Factor
  </em>
  had been around for more than a year by that point, at least on PC. Deep Field used this time wisely to gradually build upon a rock-solid survival co-op foundation, resulting in one of the genre's best modern efforts on both computers and consoles. So, what is
  <em>
   Abiotic Factor
  </em>
  ? Well, you and your friends are cast as scientists who become trapped in a pretty huge underground facility that has become infested with supernatural abominations. Your group starts with very little to their name, and you need to set up a home base, find food, and progressively venture further and further out into the unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the core survival mechanics are nothing too unusual by the genre's standards,
  <em>
   Abiotic Factor
  </em>
  does a great job of cutting the fat to provide a surprisingly lean but still deep experience. Along with a sense of discovery provided through exploration and shepherded by story-based missions, the campaign also constantly makes you feel like you are growing more competent. Honestly, I tend to struggle with survival games, but I found myself enjoying
  <em>
   Abiotic Factor
  </em>
  .

  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has both
  <em>
   Ark: Survival Ascended
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ark: Survival Evolved
  </em>
  , but the former has more comprehensive crossplay coverage. The latter is mainly for PC players to play together.
  <em>
   Survival Ascended
  </em>
  allows PC, PS5, and Xbox players to share a dedicated server, and the option can be triggered or disabled as usual.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not specifically co-op,
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  is, naturally, a multiplayer survival game that can hold up to roughly 70 players on the same server. You can work against or with each other, and both relationships have their value. This version of the game has a pretty mixed reputation, but it has also never really lost popularity and servers are wildly active. If you have never played
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  , I would recommend
  <em>
   Survival Ascended
  </em>
  since it is clearly the future.

  Currently available in early access/game preview,
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  is still a work in progress; however, the current version is already impressive and provides a fairly complete experience, at least in terms of showcasing the roguelite's core gameplay loop. One of the most existing co-op games in a long time, Thunder Lotus's project delivers on its title's promise: 33-user multiplayer. Now, that does not mean you will be constantly battling alongside 32 other people, as that is rarely the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting aside time spent in the Dark Forest, which is the hub area, you are dropped onto a large map, where you are encouraged to explore, kill monsters, collect resources, take on Torture Chambers, and eventually defeat the main bosses. For the most part, players will split up into smaller groups so they can cover as much ground as possible, especially since certain challenges come with restrictions anyway.
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  emphasize smart and cohesive teamwork, and even as groups spread across the terrain, they are still all working toward the same endpoint.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of actual gameplay,
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  shares similarities with
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , offering fast-paced isometric action with stylish combat. As a roguelite, players will constantly be upgrading their skills during a run, and long-term progression is tied to the Feat Level. There are also plenty of weapons to pick from, although sticking to one is generally advised.

 <p>
  While not 100% guaranteed, most modern sports games tend to incorporate crossplay support, just because these projects live and die because of the viability of their online sessions. Thanks to its collaboration with EA Play, Xbox Game Pass has a few cross-platform sports games, although exceptions exist. For example,
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 24
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   NHL 24
  </em>
  support crossplay, but
  <em>
   UFC 5
  </em>
  does not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  is another project that allows PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S users to play with or against each other, and the feature is activated by default (although it can be turned off via the Xbox's system settings).
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  has quite a few multiplayer options, and they generally support cross-platform play. For instance, the feature is available in Franchise and Ultimate Team, which are arguably the most popular modes in the game.

 <p>
  With new releases being a yearly tradition,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  should not have felt like a big deal. Activision's game was always going to be a huge commercial success because the IP has become so inescapable that financial failure seems impossible; however, the previous entry,
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, garnered pretty universal criticism, especially its single-player campaign. Even the usually reliable Zombies mode struggled to receive a global nod of approval, largely thanks to
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  taking an open-world approach that lacked the intensity of waved-based missions. Therefore,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was a sure-fire blockbuster, but it was hardly a guaranteed critical darling.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly, the game debuted directly on Game Pass, a first for the franchise. This presented a rare opportunity for
  <em>
   COD
  </em>
  to bring back lapsed players who had grown tired of the formula and had no desire to drop cash on a new project. To cater to these returnees (or even newcomers),
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  wisely incorporated a lengthy and enjoyable single-player campaign that hearkens back to the franchise's glory days.
 </p>
 <p>
  As good as the story is,
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  's legacy will be defined by its multiplayer, both the PvP modes and Zombies. Wisely, crossplay is thoroughly supported, allowing players from all ecosystems to play together. This is a particularly big deal for Zombies, which mostly reverted to
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's formula. That is not a bad thing. PvP also plays things safe, delivering reliable maps and staple game modes.
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  is among the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games in a long while, and it serves as a great reintroduction to the franchise.

  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  is in a bit of a weird spot. On the one hand, it is a solid-enough third-person shooter that makes respectable use of a decorated IP. On the other hand, there are quite a few better co-op shooters on the market, causing this game to be a rather hard sell.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, if you and your friends are really into
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  , then I recommend giving
  <em>
   Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  's campaign a try. It is quite short and can be easily completed over a weekend, and it does a pretty great job of replicating the classic movie's look and atmosphere.
  <em>
   Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  is not lacking in depth either, as there are multiple classes with progression trees. However, just start with a single run of the campaign and then see if you want to repeat it.

  Nothing in the world is less fun than moving from one house to another. The event is tedious, frustrating, and prone to disastrous errors; the sooner it is done, the better. Naturally, this process sounds like the perfect basis for a video game series!
  <em>
   Moving Out
  </em>
  serves as a prime example that developers can make anything fun with the right creativity and, more often than not, co-op. The original 2020 entry is a delightful psychics-based sim that challenges players to take charge of a moving company that tends to accept requests that are a bit unusual. It proved that this concept can work in a party setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  builds upon its predecessor's foundations, delivering a similar gameplay loop that is enhanced through far more absurd scenarios. Yes, this is a multiverse adventure that sends movers across dimensions. Putting aside the ridiculous missions,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is, at its core, a puzzle game about finding the ideal path to ensure that as many items survive the transfer process in one piece, which is easier said than done. Communication is key, especially since the title really should be played with a few friends. Sure, single-player is an option, but
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  loses a lot when co-op is not involved. It is simply designed for multiplayer. Fortunately, the game supports cross-platform play, so it should not be that difficult to set up a play session.

  Following a stellar debut,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's post-launch life has been slightly messy. Blizzard's action RPG has developed a mixed reputation, with every new update seemingly muddying the water more. Even if not universally loved,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is nevertheless a big deal with plenty of positives in its favor, including a reasonably fun single-player campaign that should be able to keep someone entertained for a couple of hours. However, this franchise has never prioritized storytelling, and that remains true with the 2023 entry. As such, players will be spending most of their time grinding for loot in the endgame, which is the section that has arguably garnered the most criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  shines the brightest when played in co-op, a feature complemented by widespread cross-platform support. The multiplayer element has some issues, like launching with a lack of a global chat, but co-op can be an absolute blast as it allows players to take advantage of the different classes' complementary capabilities. More importantly,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has come quite far since its launch, steadily developing into a more robust and complete experience. While the
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  expansion requires additional investment, Blizzard regularly releases free updates that improve (or just change) the base game.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a series full of memorable characters, who are written with great care. From anti-hero protagonists who stand up for the right thing despite being a bit wrong themselves to dastardly antagonists who personify what it means to be a scumbag, there's no shortage of great
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  characters that leave a lasting impression on players.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  Some of these characters form long-lasting partnerships that are very fruitful in the long run. Given that
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  's Bonnie and Clyde dynamic has already become iconic before the game has even been released, it's easy to see why people want to learn more about other partnerships in the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  series.

  Michael Townley and Trevor Philips had a profitable time together as robbers, but the former soon realized that Trevor was too unhinged for his own good. So, he decided to fake his death and end this partnership before they eventually got themselves killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, after being forced into a jewelry store heist and uttering a familiar sentence on camera, Trevor caught wind of his partner's faked demise and eventually reunited with him. The toxic nature of their partnership flares up, but it's clear that both care for each other despite their differences, something that Franklin uses to mend their relations before the final mission.

  When CJ meets Cesar for the first time, the meeting is far from cordial. The protective elder brother doesn't like seeing his sweet sister in the arms of a man from another gang, but Cesar is respectful toward Kendl's brother and tries his hardest to get in his good books.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, CJ comes to trust him as an ally, especially when C.R.A.S.H. overplays its hand and forces CJ to figure out a way to come back to Los Santos. With the help of Cesar and his allies, CJ comes back to his home, drives the Ballas out of Grove Street, takes over Los Santos, and gives both Big Smoke and Tenpenny the brutal deaths they deserve.

  There's no denying that Niko can be a bit of an annoyance at times, but his levity is precisely what makes the events of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  so much more memorable. His lies entice his cousin, Niko, to Liberty City, only for him to find out that Roman was greatly exaggerating the kind of life he was living there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite all their strife, Niko and Roman have a great bond that is fleshed out pretty well in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  . This is precisely what makes the events of one particular ending hard to digest, since Niko has to see his cousin die on what should've been the happiest day of his life.

  Despite how
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  ends, there's no denying that Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance have a great partnership when things are looking up. Both gangsters wanted to make it big in the city, although it became clear in no time that Tommy was far more ambitious than Lance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This drives a wedge in their friendship that eventually leads to Lance siding with Sonny Forelli in a bid to take out Tommy for good. Unfortunately, Lance chose the wrong side, with a vengeful Tommy taking out all his enemies (and former friends) before ruling over Vice City with Ken Rosenberg.

  Human partners may be pretty prevalent in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  , but it's the bond between Franklin and Chop that stands out because of how unique it is. Pets haven't been a huge part of the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  series, which is why Chop leaves such a lasting impression on players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Siccing him on gangsters and seeing him chomp down on the most sensitive locations is hilarious every single time. It's clear that Chop is very loyal to his own and ensures that no harm befalls Franklin when they're together.

  CJ's tumultuous past makes his reunion with his brother bittersweet (no pun intended). Brian's death drove a wedge between the two that deepened after CJ wasn't around when his mother was killed, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was clear that Carl wanted to make things right and proved this to Sweet time and time again with his actions. While he gets captured by the police, CJ proves that he can stand on his own two feet in the face of adversity and helps his brother escape, winning his respect and mending their complicated relationship.

  After leaving his life of crime, Michael was stuck in a midlife crisis that finally saw something new when he managed to thwart Franklin's carjacking attempt. Their first meeting kick-started an unlikely partnership, where Michael ended up serving as a sort of mentor to Franklin and helped him earn more dough than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when Michael's demons come knocking at his door, it becomes clear that he needs Franklin more as the game goes on. This can make the events of one ending quite heartbreaking, where Franklin kills Michael after a heartbreaking exchange, with the emotional cherry on top being his call to Lamar right after, where he quotes Michael in a rather depressing ending that is far from the ideal conclusion fans want for the duo.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has always been known for its massive battles, destructible buildings, and realistic war zones. But beyond the chaos of online matches, the single-player campaigns gave the series a personal side. They showed the human stories behind the guns and explosions. Some campaigns focused on emotional moments, while others focused on humor or pure action.

  Over the years, EA and DICE experimented with different tones and settings. While some
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  campaigns were not so good, including
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  , others defined what
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  storytelling could be. And for that, they can’t be ignored. Beneath the explosions and chaos, these
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  campaigns have offered some of the most storytelling and cinematic experiences in first-person shooters.

  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  ’s campaign is packed with action and cinematic moments. It follows Sergeant Daniel Recker and his squad as they deal with global tensions between the U.S., China, and Russia. The missions take players from collapsing cities to massive naval battles, with explosions and destruction that show off the game’s advanced Frostbite engine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story is serviceable but not very deep. It’s mostly there to tie the missions together. Players spend most of their time fighting through enemy strongholds, controlling tanks, or leading assaults while buildings crumble around them.

  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  ’s campaign focuses on a U.S. Marine, Sergeant Blackburn, caught in a modern global conflict. The missions are cinematic, full of quick camera cuts, explosions, and large-scale battles. It plays like a Hollywood war movie, and the pacing never slows down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The campaign includes memorable moments like crawling through city streets under sniper fire, a tense jet mission, and chaotic firefights in Paris. The gameplay is sharp and visually impressive, but the story itself feels predictable. It’s designed for intensity, not emotional depth.

  <em>
   Battlefield V
  </em>
  ’s single-player campaign is divided into short stories called War Stories, just like
  <em>
   Battlefield 1
  </em>
  . Each story focuses on a different side of World War II, giving players a glimpse into lesser-known parts of the conflict.
 </p>
 <p>
  One story follows a young Norwegian resistance fighter; another centers on a Senegalese soldier serving in France; and the most praised one, “The Last Tiger,” puts players in the shoes of a German tank commander near the war’s end. The gameplay also shifts between stealth, open combat, and vehicle missions.

  <em>
   Battlefield 1
  </em>
  tells the story of World War I through several short chapters called War Stories. Each focuses on a different soldier: a tank driver, a fighter pilot, a messenger, or an infantryman trapped behind enemy lines. Instead of one long plot, the game uses small human stories to show the war’s scale and suffering.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each story has a different tone. One mission focuses on friendship and sacrifice inside a tank crew, while another captures the freedom and danger of flying biplanes. The variety keeps the campaign emotional and engaging from start to finish.
  <em>
   Battlefield 1
  </em>
  did a good job of showing the human side of war without losing the excitement of large-scale combat.

  <em>
   Battlefield Hardline
  </em>
  breaks from military warzones and turns into a cop story. The campaign follows detective Nick Mendoza, a police officer caught in a web of drug deals, corruption, and betrayal. It feels more like a crime TV show than a war movie, complete with episodes and cliffhangers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each mission focuses on urban action. Players raid gang hideouts, chase criminals through the streets, and investigate evidence. The game lets you arrest suspects instead of killing them, which adds a new tactical layer. But when the bullets start flying, it’s pure chaos, with vehicles, explosions, and city destruction.

  <em>
   Battlefield: Bad Company
  </em>
  introduced something new with a story filled with humor and personality. It follows Private Preston Marlowe and his squad of troublemakers known as Bad Company. They’re not heroes or villains; they’re soldiers who stumble into chaos while chasing rumors of stolen gold.
 </p>
 <p>
  The campaign mixes comedy with big action moments. Players blow up buildings, steal vehicles, and take on entire armies while listening to sarcastic banter between squadmates. Each character has a distinct voice, and the writing feels lighthearted compared to the usual grim tone of war games. Bad Company’s campaign might not be emotionally deep, but it’s entertaining. It’s the first Battlefield game where players cared about the characters as much as the explosions.

  <em>
   Battlefield: Bad Company 2
  </em>
  builds on what made the first one great. The campaign places players back with Preston Marlowe and his squad, but this time the stakes are higher and the tone slightly more serious in places, yet the banter and personality remain central.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mission variety expands, as players can now engage in better urban combat, vehicle-heavy desert battles, and stealthy infiltration. The game also introduced more open sections where players could choose how to tackle objectives, allowing for emergent tactics that reward creativity.

  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  has been off to a strong start, with the game racking up some impressive player numbers in its first week. On Steam, the game achieved a concurrent player count of over 700,00 and continues to pull in hundreds of thousands of players daily. When accounting for all platforms,
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  has reportedly sold over 7 million copies. While there have been some issues players wish to see the developers address, the launch of the next installment in the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  franchise has been a hit with the gaming community. As players continue to jump into multiplayer matches,
  <em>
  </em>
  some unusual discoveries have already been made.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <h2 id="battlefield-6-recon-drone-glitch">
  Battlefield 6 Recon Drone Glitch
 </h2>
 <p>
  One of these bizarre discoveries involves the recon drone in
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  . As seen in a clip shared by CharlieIntel, players have learned how to stand on these drones and ride them upwards. It is worth noting that players need to use a sledgehammer; otherwise, they will fall off when the machine moves. Specifically, players can gain altitude while on the drone if they hit it with the sledgehammer. Humorously, this technique allows players to rise high above the battlefield. In the clip, the player even used the elevated position as a sniper perch, allowing them to get a few kills.
 </p>
 <p>
  This appears to be an unintended glitch, meaning it could be patched soon. With this in mind, players will likely have a short time left to try it out. Additionally, the viability of the bug is limited as players must coordinate with an ally to deploy the drone in a favorable spot. Furthermore, while this exploit provides a higher vantage point over
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's maps, it also leaves the player exposed to enemy gunfire. Regardless, the bug has the potential to create some hilarious highlights for
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  players.

  While this drone bug will likely be removed soon, it is far from the only thing on the development team’s radar. Since release, various updates have been rolled out that address community concerns. For example, a recent
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  hotfix resolved some hit registration issues that players have encountered. Meanwhile, the developer has also updated the Conquest mode, among other things.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be interesting to see if
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  can keep its momentum going, especially once
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
  </em>
  releases on November 14. While each new installment in the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  series attracts numerous fans, EA looks to be giving it some fierce competition this year. Time will tell what other unusual highlights from the latest
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game will be shared online in the coming months.

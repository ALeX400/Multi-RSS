  GTA+ recently added
  <em>
   <strong>
    Bully
   </strong>
  </em>
  to the list of games that players can enjoy with a subscription, but there are some differences between the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the games. Those who subscribe to the GTA+ service will want to know which version of
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  they'll be able to access depending on their platform of choice.

 <p>
  GTA+ is a subscription service that rolled out in 2022 that gives players perks within
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  and access to select titles from the Rockstar Games catalog. This has included games like
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   L.A. Noire
  </em>
  . Now, players can also gain access to a free Benefactor Vorschlaghammer, 100-car garage, and 1,500,000 GTA$, plus
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  rewards are the same regardless of current-gen platform.

  game for PlayStation 2. The title was re-released for the PS4 and can be played via backward compatibility on the PS5. Meanwhile, users on Xbox Series X, S, or Xbox One will be given access to
  <em>
   Bully: Scholarship Edition
  </em>
  via Xbox backward compatibility.

  Fans May Be Disappointed by Bully Version
 </h2>
 <p>
  Some fans may be let down learning the specifics of access to
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  . Initially, there was some confusion and excitement over the idea of a potential remaster of the game after the game was freshly rated in Taiwan for both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Fans have been clamoring for a remaster or full remake of
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  for years, but the IP has been largely ignored by its developer. However, the disparity between console versions may make matters worse.
 </p>

 <p>
  Some fans on PlayStation may be disappointed by the version of the game they have access to. While the game got its launch on the PS2, the Scholarship Edition of the game contains additional content that PlayStation GTA+ subscribers don't have access to. This includes missions, classes, clothing, and online minigames. The subscription fee is the same across both platforms, but that doesn't help users who don't own an Xbox console system or don't want to use it for any particular reason.

 <p>
  For now, the hope for an official
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  remaster remains out of reach. Fans will likely keep asking for one, but for the foreseeable future, Rockstar Games' focus will likely be on
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , and not its other past successes like

  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic the Hedgehog
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most iconic video game characters of all time, which is all the more impressive given the mixed reception of this franchise's games in recent times. Unlike Mario, the mascot Sega was trying to compete with, Sonic's 3D transition has been far from perfect, with a lot of these games continuing to struggle to this day. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  fans are very passionate about their favorite hedgehog and compel Sega to perfect the formula and keep the series relevant to this day.

 <p>
  While the franchise has enjoyed a string of games that are a lot of fun to play through, some of the other games in the series have either been critically panned or split fans down the middle. It's a shame that
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games don't receive the same care as
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  , but players will be pleasantly surprised if they give some of the more polarizing games a chance instead of just ignoring them outright.

 <p>
  In many ways, the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  series has been a victim of its own success. The incredible debut of this hedgehog meant that players expected games on Mario's level, only to be disappointed by how inconsistent the quality of its games has been since. This stretched all the way to the modern era, where fans salivating for a good
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game were taken aback by
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  . Everyone felt like the series would churn out such quality titles after learning from its mistakes, so
  <em>
   Sonic Superstars
  </em>
  disappointed many fans despite the game emulating a lot of what made the classic series such a blast to play through.

  A game everyone loves to hate,
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  was the first attempt by Sega to help the series transition to 3D. However, unlike the brilliance of Super Mario 64, this game has aged poorly and become a punching bag for many
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  haters who love pointing out its goofy animation and weird cutscenes. It's true that
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  's presentation isn't the greatest, but most people who checked this game out at the time loved the fast-paced gameplay, the side activities in the Chao Garden, and a string of imaginative levels.

  The high-speed segments can be a bit too railroaded for most people to enjoy, but there are many things to like about
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  and its sequel once people look past the goofy nature of the game's visuals. It's the perfect title for

  The biggest reason why many people love
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games is because of the sense of speed they enjoy in these titles, especially in the earlier entries. Translating this motion to 3D has proven to be a huge challenge for Sega time and time again, but many fans will swear by the fact that
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  is one of the few 3D games that captures this sense of motion. The daylight levels are a treat and channel the best of
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  , but it's the other half of the game that has attained its fair share of critics, and understandably so.

  </em>
  's usual gameplay, but
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  fails to capitalize on this premise. This turns the night levels into a chore that players must power through to get to the good stuff. Depending on how much players can ignore this side of the game, they either consider
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  to be an underrated classic or another poor outing for the blue Hedgehog.

  An open-world
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game sounded like a no-brainer, especially with
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Bowser's Fury
  </em>
  showing the potential of a 3D platformer set in a sandbox where players could tackle main and side challenges to make progress in the game. Sonic may be very late to this trend, but
  <em>
   Frontiers
  </em>
  does a decent job of merging the fast-paced gameplay of the series with an open-world environment to let players zoom around the world at their own pace.

 <p>
  While the gameplay mechanics and sense of speed are captured well in
  <em>
   Frontiers
  </em>
  , some players have major issues with some aspects of this title. Some of the platforming challenges don't merge well with the nature of the sandbox, and the world itself can look quite ugly at times. It's far from a perfect open-world
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game, but
  <em>
   Frontiers
  </em>
  can convince many haters to change their minds when it comes to the potential of this mascot.

  There are many reasons why
  <em>
   Sonic Lost World
  </em>
  disappointed fans. The visuals, music, and gameplay were excellent, but there were issues with the narrative and some aspects of the level design that didn't sit well with many. It's easy to write this game off as another poor entry in the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  franchise, but
  <em>
   Lost World
  </em>
  deserves a lot of credit for some impressive moments that show what a 3D
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  game is capable of.

 <p>
  Of course, there's no excuse to languish in mediocrity for so long even after the many years
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  games have operated in the video game industry. However,
  <em>
   Sonic Lost World

  is more memorable than most people would assume. The faults of the story and poor characterization can be ignored as long as players enjoy the many levels they zoom through, with the sense of speed in this title being quite enthralling.

  has various armor sets for players to craft and equip. Each individual piece of armor has its own stats, with many offering elemental or status resistance. If you get and equip enough armor pieces of the same set, you'll get a bonus that usually is beneficial to the current area you're in.

  While there are benefits to mixing and matching armor pieces to go for the best stats, it's equally if not more beneficial to complete a set and take advantage of the armor set bonus to dominate through whatever edge it gives. Silk will be a common crafting material that players will need to craft new armor pieces and complete sets; here's how to get it quickly.

  Silk doesn't grow on trees, and can't be found randomly while exploring. Instead, Silk is
  <strong>
   dropped either from enemies, purchased in the store, or obtained when looting chests
  </strong>
  . While chests can offer decent sums, the ideal method for obtaining silk is through farming monsters, specifically those in Chapter 2.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   basic rat enemies in Chapter 2 have a good chance of dropping silk
  </strong>
  , with about one in every four dropping silk. Larger enemies still have a chance of dropping silk, but their loot will usually include Yaoguai Cores, which are needed to upgrade your weapon. These basic enemies will also respawn every time you rest or die, making them ideal enemies to farm for silk, and will also help you level up quickly to unlock additional skills.

 <p>
  Will is the basic currency of the game, and once it is obtained it can't be lost even on death. Overall, Will is easy to come by, and
  <strong>
   selling your Silk for a quick cash out is not advised
  </strong>
  . As you progress through the game and reach new areas or beat specific bosses, you'll be able to craft new armor pieces at a shrine. In a shrine, select the craft menu then, "Craft Armor" to see every armor piece that can be crafted.

 <p>
  Armor sets are unlocked all at once, letting you see the various stats of each armor piece and the overall benefit of the armor set.
  <strong>
   Just about every armor piece will require Silk
  </strong>
  , so it is best to save it up right away and farm it whenever you can. Once armor is crafted, that Silk can't be taken back, so always double-check how much Silk you have before using it all to make armor you'll be stuck with.

 <p>
  Bethesda's sci-fi FPS RPG,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  , is approaching a year since its initial release last Fall. As the studio's first new IP in many years,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  saw a bit of a mixed reception in some parts of its story and design. Yet its take on a NASA-punk-inspired future and sheer breadth of locations to discover still provided an engaging experience for many players, and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  went on to become one of 2023's bestselling games.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has also continued to receive hotfixes and quality of life additions since launch, smoothing out some of its earlier rough patches and setting up future content.

  The most recent of these was just dropped during Gamescom 2024, via a trailer showcasing
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's latest update. Bethesda announced the addition of a drivable all-terrain vehicle, the REV-8, to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , checking off a feature that had previously been highly requested. The trailer also teased more of its first major upcoming DLC, Shattered Space, which was given a firm release date. With its inclusion, the REV-8 provides a great incentive for fans to head back out into the far reaches of the galaxy, and simultaneously serves to ramp up buzz for Shattered Space.

  <em>

  features an impressive array of planets and other celestial bodies to explore. However, one of the bigger criticisms leveraged against it was that, after a while, they could seem too repetitive and often desolate. This is mitigated by those with more interesting points of interest or ones that house rare and valuable materials. But the empty nature of others, combined with the sometimes long gaps between finding a colorful location and another dusty moon, threatened to drag down the experience at times.

  Compounding the above, the only way to navigate across
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's locales previously was on foot. Even on a lower-G planet or with a decent boost pack, this could end up feeling like more of a chore rather than evoking a sense of wonder and discovery. The REV-8 looks to remedy this. In the latest footage, it can be seen zipping around and performing impressive jumps, assisted by a boosting system of its own. It also seems to be equipped with at least one weapon. All are welcome and excellent inclusions, and hold promise for how
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  aims to continue iterating.

  How Starfield's REV-8 Leads the Way to Shattered Space
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Shattered Space DLC will focus on House Va'ruun and the shadowy faction's mysterious agenda. It will be the biggest post-launch piece of content so far, and expectations are equally high. While fans await Shattered Space, the REV-8 update fulfills a request that many had been hoping for, potentially drawing back those who haven't hopped into it in a while, and highlighting Bethesda's stated commitment to supporting
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  far into the future.

 <p>
  While there remain some unknowns surrounding Shattered Space, based on prior information, House Va'ruun's home world of Va'ruun'kai appears to be a rocky one, with uneven natural formations and jagged structures dotting its landscape. The REV-8 can be seen in the Shattered Space portion of the latest trailer, implying it will play a bigger part in the DLC. Bethesda may be gearing up to focus more on vehicles, perhaps by having missions designed around the REV-8 in Shattered Space. With not long to go before Shattered Space, the REV-8 update offers a compelling reason for fans to return, and might be an indication of the areas of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  that Bethesda may expand and improve on in it.

  Keeping a small farm is a great way to get important ingredients for food and drinks in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Once Human

  . While it can be a little costly or complicated to maintain your own personal vegetable garden, keeping a Rain Man in your base should make things a little easier.

  A Rain Man is a type of Deviant that helps around the player's home. It doesn't fight like other Deviants like
  <em>
   Once Human's
  </em>
  Pyro Dino, but it's a valuable addition to any base with plants that need tending. Here's how you can find one of these Deviants.

  The Rain Man is similar to the Artisan's Hand Deviant in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  in the sense that it must be looted from an enemy's body. The kicker here is
  <strong>
   the drop rate for Rain Man appears to be very low
  </strong>
  . There's a chance that Rainfall Reapers won't drop anything at all too, so it may take a while before you can get a Rain Man to drop.

  Farming the Rainfall Reapers in
  <strong>
   Harborside
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Sutherland Chemical Plant
  </strong>
  is likely the best option players have. The two areas are relatively close to each other, and there's a Teleportation Tower between them as well. However, driving between these POIs will take a toll on your fuel reserves. If you can, place your house near one of them so you have a free fast travel point. Alternatively, you can always rush the Seepage Zone in Silo Phi.

  What Does The Rain Man Do?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Rain Men are among the many Territory Deviants in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , and their job is to
  <strong>
   water the plants in your garden
  </strong>
  . They fulfill the same role as automatic irrigation systems, albeit with a number of pros and cons.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":783} -->

 <p>
  Rain Men do not consume water or electricity when they're watering a plant. All they need is enough Deviant Power to keep running. On the flip side, one Rain Man can only water one crop at a time. If you have a vegetable garden growing in your base, an irrigation system is ultimately going to be more efficient at keeping your plants healthy.

 <p>
  Naturally, Rain Men work best with other farming-type deviants in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  like the Buzzy Bee and Growshroom. They're especially helpful if you want to have a constant supply of beer for staving off Sanity reduction.

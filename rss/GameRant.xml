      <title>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Might Make a Case for a More Focused Approach to DB Games</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  has continued to show its love for every corner of the series, with the recent reveal that its final launch roster will feature a whopping 181 fighters. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, casting such a wide net can have its fair share of downsides as well.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  repeats one trend with its story mode, and it's one that the next
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game would be better off without.

  Many
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games simply recap events of the anime's story.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  is more than iconic enough to warrant a direct adaptation, but the series has returned to the same well far too many times at this point. Furthermore, these games often adapt as much of the anime as possible, and
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  appears to continue this trend as well. When the next
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game inevitably arrives, developers should be sure to narrow their focus.

  Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Succeeds at Pure Fan Service

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is the upcoming sequel to the beloved
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series, and the resemblance is more than a little apparent.
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  shares many of its predecessors' priorities, between its jaw-dropping roster size, bombastic action, and even its approach to storytelling. Although many enjoy the similarities between
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  , future games should try a new path.
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is a spectacle of fan service first and foremost. Within every aspect of the game, even its marketing before release, this priority is abundantly clear. When it comes to meeting this goal,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  succeeds with flying colors. The game manages to capture
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  in its totality, with its roster and story alike. However, if the next
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game wants to leave an impression, one untested approach could hold the secret ingredient.

  Future Dragon Ball Games Should Focus On Specific Sagas
 </h3>
 <p>
  Many
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games often try to capture as many story arcs as possible, especially when it comes to adapting
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  . By contrast, any story arcs before
  <em>
   DBZ
  </em>
  are few and far between in most games. Likewise, most
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games skip over many major events from
  <em>
   GT
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  has received more attention in recent years, but
  <em>
   GT
  </em>
  's controversial status makes its exclusion understandable enough.

 <p>
  There is already a question of how many times players will want to replay a story they've already seen. This question is made that much more pressing when one notices the clear favoritism at play. Regardless, a simple solution could help the series move in a different direction. Instead of attempting to adapt
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  in its entirety, and losing focus on many important story arcs, future
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games could be entirely dedicated to one arc in particular.

  The Next Dragon Ball Game Has an Important Choice to Make
 </h3>
 <p>
  Rather than quickly running from one arc to the next, many arcs deserve an entire game in their own right. Many fans have played through the story of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  dozens of times across several games, but a more focused story mode could present these arcs in their best state yet. Likewise, developers could eventually give more spotlight to the characters and stories that have drawn the short straw so far.

 <p>
  A game focusing solely on the earliest events of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  could be a real treat for fans. After all, it would allow players to fight through a solid adaptation of the tournament that gave the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series its name. And while the Frieza Saga has been abridged plenty of times at this point, a game focused entirely on the arc could have a dramatic weight not seen in previous adaptations.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  has plenty of iconic stories to pull from, and many of them could be the subject of their own game. Many
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  protagonists could lead their own game, and
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's What Ifs show the value of original storytelling. However, if
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games continue to adapt existing story arcs, they could hugely benefit from a much more narrow focus.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  has just recently launched its Shattered Space DLC, but players trying to get in on the action are running into a "Lookup Failed" error.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has been hyping its Shattered Space DLC for quite some time, teasing players with the chance to explore House Va'ruun's home planet. Unfortunately, the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  DLC's release has had some hiccups.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  subreddit has multiple posts from people who are running into issues trying to access the DLC. For the record, to start the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  DLC, players need to have completed the One Small Step quest. At that point, they will have to grav-jump to a system that's not currently being used by any story developments or events. That will get the DLC's story in motion.

 <p>
  The problem is the Lookup Failed error is keeping players from getting Shattered Space started. One Reddit post by Mk18mitch, spotted by Pure Xbox, illustrated the situation. Upon arriving at what is presumably supposed to be Va'ruun'kai, they are instead met with a red and green planet with the words "Default Planet Material. The Swap Hasn't Occurred" plastered on the front of it. The system information on the side of the screen says "Lookup Failed," meaning that the Reddit user will be unable to travel to the planet and continue the DLC until the problem is resolved. Other players have been unable to get the DLC to start at all, possibly due to an error unrelated to "Lookup Failed."

 <p>
  Luckily, there may be some solutions to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Lookup Failed error. While mileage may vary, some players have reported success after restarting their Xbox consoles. Players may want to clear their alternate Mac address on their consoles to be sure. For some players, they were unable to get the DLC to start because they didn't have the latest update downloaded.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  released a new update alongside the DLC (Update 1.14.70), so players should make sure that their game is updated to the latest version before trying to get Shattered Space to work.
 </p>

 <p>
  Now, it's entirely possible those solutions won't resolve the issue for all
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  players. Indeed, there are those who claim to have restarted their consoles multiple times and still are unable to play the DLC. If there is some kind of bigger problem keeping
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  fans from playing the Shattered Space expansion, hopefully a hot fix will be pushed out to address those issues sooner rather than later. In the meantime,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  fans can try restarting their system, clearing their alternate Mac address, and making sure that they have the latest update installed.

  On the other side of the spectrum, there is the Triumphant and highest ranking; whoever is declared Triumphant by the end of Act 3 (Singularity Era) will be considered the winner of the game in

  <strong>
   Therefore, to win
   <em>

   </em>
   , gamers have to guarantee that they make it to Act 3 by surviving their opponents and the culling, and they must earn enough Prestige to be considered Triumphant once Act 3 ends

  Every month, Sony introduces a lineup of monthly free games for PS Plus Essential subscribers. For $79.99 a year, the PS Plus Essential tier also gives subscribers exclusive discounts and content, cloud storage, Share Play functionality, and access to online multiplayer with their favorite games. PS Plus Extra and Premium members may also take advantage of these benefits and redeem their monthly games. The September 2024 batch of PS Plus games consists of
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   MLB The Show 24
  </em>
  . These three games were first made available to redeem on September 3, and time is quickly running out before the October 2024 lineup goes live on Tuesday, October 1.

  </em>
  ,
  <em>

  </em>
  , and
  <em>

  for free on their PlayStation Network account. Players may redeem these titles directly from the PlayStation Store on their PS4 or PS5 consoles and begin to download their games if enough storage space is available. Those away from their console may also redeem the titles by logging into an account with an active PS Plus membership on browsers or the PlayStation mobile app. If a PS4 or PS5 console is synced to the PS app, players may immediately begin to download their PS Plus games to their consoles as well. The app also allows users to browse their entire game library, including past titles they redeemed with PS Plus.

      <title>Why Persona 6 Could Feel a Lot like Pokemon Gen 5</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/persona-6-pokemon-gen-5-black-white-duality-rumors/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is rumored to be on the horizon, only speculation and unconfirmed leaks have provided any clues about what to expect from the next entry in Atlus' beloved series. As with each title before, it's at least predicted to usher in a new era for the franchise by defining its own unique theme and aesthetic. In light of recent rumors, however,
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  seems set on exploring themes specifically reminiscent of
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White
  </em>
  's dualistic conflict.

 <p>
  Rumors have previously connected
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  to the color green, but newer speculation has pointed to a new emphasis on black and white, possibly drawing parallels to the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  titles of that namesake. In that series, those fifth-generation titles have been remembered fondly for their exploration of dualism, reflecting the yin and yang concept in one of the most sophisticated stories that
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  has featured. If
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  adopts a similar approach for its story as has apparently been leaked, its own conflict could heavily align with Generation 5's thematic core.

  Dual Protagonists Could Bring Contrast Front and Center

 <p>
  One of the more striking claims about
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  indicates the inclusion of two player characters in a way that resembles
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  's dual protagonists and how they represented contrasting perspectives. According to leaks, these characters might be named Kuro and Shiro, words that literally translate to black and white respectively. Such explicit names would suggest a direct exploration of opposing forces, much like the purpose the Legendaries of
  <em>
   Pokemon BW
  </em>
  served.

  In a post on X/Twitter, p0wyful stated that
  <em>
   P6

  will be set within an academic setting familiar to the series, but this time with the twist of being a school focused on the arts:

  Through potentially bringing a conflict between these sorts of beliefs or mindsets into

  If the leaks are accurate,
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  has the opportunity to represent opposing philosophical or ideological standpoints through its cast. N and Ghetsis of
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White
  </em>
  are two examples of representations of the game's contrasting stances on interacting with Pokemon, liberating them in the name of ideals or using them as tools for truth. If
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  features modernity and tradition for its own themes, the tension between them could easily mirror the grey morality present in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  to create a compelling narrative of its own.

 <p>
  The strategy of releasing two editions of the same basic game set
  <em>
   Pokemon BW
  </em>
  up for a poignant way to incorporate its theme into every possible aspect of those releases, but
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  would be going even further out of its way for this purpose if its rumors come to be. Naming the protagonists Kuro and Shiro and splitting the single game between them would be a departure from the traditional structure of the series for the sake of emphasizing duality, an effort which could see
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  tackling timeless questions that could remain thought-provoking for years to come.

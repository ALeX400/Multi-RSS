  With The Iron Rig DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dredge
   </em>
  </strong>
  introduces a new strain of sea creatures which it labels
  <strong>
   'Exotic.'
  </strong>
  These new fish are extremely difficult to find, with most fishing spots providing just the slimmest chance to catch them. The best way to guarantee an
  <strong>
   E xotic
  </strong>
  catch, is to use
  <strong>
   Exotic Bait.
  </strong>
  This guide will show players
  <strong>
   how to get Exotic Bait in
   <em>
    Dredge,
   </em>
  </strong>
  and how and where to use it.

 <p>
  To use
  <strong>
   Exotic Bait
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Dredge,
  </em>
  players will first have to get their hands on it. Currently, the only way to acquire this bait is to craft it at the
  <strong>
   Factory
  </strong>
  on the
  <strong>
   Iron Rig
  </strong>
  . However, it is not available until the Factory has been fully upgraded, which occurs at the fourth tier. To reach this point, follow these steps:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   Begin
   <strong>
    The Scientist's questline:
   </strong>
   The major events that occur on the Iron Rig are initiated by starting the Scientist's quests. He will send you out to multiple locations to collect fish, as well as a sample of the
   <strong>
    Dark Liquid
   </strong>
   . After completing the first quest, players will begin building other structures on the rig, including the Factory.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Collect Crates for Crafting and Upgrades
   </strong>
   : Every major upgrade to the Iron Rig will use the crates that went missing from the Iron Rig's supply ships. Make sure to collect them every time you encounter one. As you progress through the main mission, their locations will eventually be added to the Map.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Upgrade Structures
   </strong>
   : Make sure to upgrade a structure every time the opportunity arises. There are several points in the story where it will not move forward until an upgrade is done.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Complete Iron Rig Defense
   </strong>
   : The final step before Tier 4 Factory becomes available to unlock is completing the Iron Rig's defense system. You'll know you are close when the tentacles emerge from the sea and wrap around the base of the rig.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Once you have successfully
  <strong>
   crafted Exotic Bait,
  </strong>
  you'll be ready to head out into open water and use it. To
  <strong>
   use Exotic Bait in
   <em>
    Dredge,
   </em>
  </strong>
  you'll need to make sure you have it in your main inventory, not your storage. Then, when you head out into open water, open your Skill wheel by holding LB/L1. Look for the
  <strong>
   bucket symbol
  </strong>
  at the bottom of the wheel, and select Bait.

  When you have Bait equipped, make sure to check the display box on the lower left side of the HUD. You'll want to ensure its set to Exotic Bait. If you have multiple types of Bait in your inventory, you can cycle through them using R2/RT and L2/LT. When you land on
  <strong>
   Exotic Bait
  </strong>
  , press Square/X to drop it in the ocean. A new fishing spot will appear in the exact location. It appears that only

  One of the very first decisions a player will be met with when playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Satisfactory
   </em>
  </strong>
  is which world they choose to land in. Each world comes packed with a large area full of life, items, and resources that can be farmed, and all of them come with their own level of challenges and struggles. For beginners, selecting the right world for their skill level will make all the difference between survival and finding any corner of the map to hide away from the threats roaming around.

 <p>
  The best part about which world to land in
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  is that the choice is ultimately up to the player. Each map is tailored to every play style, whether pioneers wish to lay back and take things easy while learning the ropes of the game, or jumping into the deep end and taking on every challenge that comes their way. This guide will cover every world available in
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  , what degree of difficulty they have, and which one is the best for beginners.

  In total, there are four maps available in
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  , and they vary in difficulty, starting with a map dedicated for players looking to play passively, all the way up to hardcore difficulty meant for players who are looking for a challenge. Players have the ability to choose whichever world best fits their skill level, but once chosen, that decision cannot be undone. Players can alternatively create four different worlds, playing all four maps and testing out which one best fits their abilities.

 <p>
  Upon loading up
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  , pioneers will select the choice of starting a new game and be met with the choice of four worlds to select from. Thankfully, developer Coffee Stain Studios makes it simple by offering players a brief description of what to expect from each map. Suggestions are also made for players who are unsure of which map to go with, so reading each description is important when selecting the map.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Grass Fields:
   </strong>
   Ideal for first-time pioneers; this map has a completely flat terrain with a good amount of resources, diversity, and biomass.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Rocky Desert:
   </strong>
   Suitable for first-time pioneers; slightly less flat than Grassy Fields, but offers a greater diversity of resources.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Northern Forest:
   </strong>
   Good for experienced pioneers; fewer open areas and less flat land, making it harder to build, but also comes packed with excellent resource diversity and biomass.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Dune Desert:
   </strong>
   The most challenging world for pioneers; water and foliage are more rare compared to other worlds, making it more difficult to build more complex equipment and tools.

 <p>
  For first-time players who have little-to-no experience with open-world building games,
  <strong>
   Grassy Fields
  </strong>
  is the best way to go for ease of access and little danger. This world will offer players an opportunity to explore the land and get a feel for the controls and different aspects of
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  , while learning about the many different buildings and tools, and what they offer. This choice will give pioneers plenty of time to gain experience and understand the game from the inside out.

 <p>
  Should it feel too easy, players can create a second world and test out one of the three remaining locations.
  <strong>
   Rocky Desert
  </strong>
  is a small step up from Grassy Fields and remains easier to navigate and build, while
  <strong>
   Northern Forest
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Dune Desert
  </strong>
  present difficulty with finding spots to build on and avoid running into any danger along the way. For beginners, going with one of the first two maps is probably for the best, especially for pioneers looking to unwind and relax after a long day.

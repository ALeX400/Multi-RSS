      <title>The 10 Best Horror Games of 2024</title>

  Horror games tap into the innate anxieties (both physical and existential) that are shared among people, allowing players to interact with and face their fears in a way no other medium can. The past year has been chock-full of great horror games, proving that the genre continues to thrive no matter the era. And while 2024 was host to some brand-new horror experiences that are pushing the envelope for the genre, a lot of great games were those that captured PS1 aesthetics and the greatness of the past.

  Aside from newer, atmospheric indie horror games, though, 2024 brought one of the most anticipated game remakes (horror or otherwise) with Bloober Team's
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  . More than just a visual uplift of a beloved classic, Bloober Team's remake is nothing short of a win for the team, immediately earning its place as not just one of the year's best horror games but one of the year's best games, period. Together with the smaller titles delivered from talented indie studios,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  and the other genre highlights of the year told compelling stories that urged players to come face to face with the darker aspects of life, if they were brave enough.
  <strong>
   Presented in alphabetical order
  </strong>
  , these are the 10 best horror games of 2024.

  The debut title from solo developer Jordan Mochi,
  <em>
   Conscript
  </em>
  immediately sets itself apart thanks to its real-world setting and emphasis on psychological horror. Taking place during the infamous Battle of Verdun in World War I, players in
  <em>
   Conscript
  </em>
  assume the role of a young conscripted French soldier as they fight against the German advance and search for their missing younger brother. With its eye-catching PS1-style visuals and oppressive atmosphere,
  <em>
   Conscript
  </em>
  is largely carried by its setting and presentation, but its classic survival horror gameplay completes the package to make it one of the year's best retro-inspired survival horror titles.

  SFB Games'
  <em>
   Crow Country
  </em>
  is a concise game that proves big things can come in small packages, providing one of the more true-to-form retro survival horror experiences of the year. As FBI Agent Mara Forest, players head to the abandoned titular amusement park to track down its mysterious owner, Edward Crow. In addition to providing a classically-styled survival horror experience without an ounce of bloat,
  <em>
   Crow Country
  </em>
  's story gradually reveals itself in layers to be one of the year's simultaneously strangest, and most heartfelt, horror narratives.

  Branching out from its place as one of the premier studios working on horror films, Blumhouse has opened a games division aimed at producing horror games with a similar eye for production values and mass appeal.
  <em>
   Fear the Spotlight
  </em>
  is one of those games that ticks all the boxes for what players would expect from a classic survival horror experience, complete with some strong puzzle design and a compelling narrative that draws players into the game's mystery. And, like
  <em>
   Crow Country
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fear the Spotlight
  </em>
  is a tight experience that never comes close to overstaying its welcome.

  Another of the year's best horror games and yet another debut title from an indie studio,
  <em>
   Home Safety Hotline
  </em>
  ended up being one of 2024's early highlights in the horror genre. The premise is fairly straightforward, with players assuming the role of an emergency operator fielding calls from concerned citizens regarding incidents occurring in their homes. But in execution,
  <em>
   Home Safety Hotline
  </em>
  quickly distorts reality and upends player expectations by devolving into a
  <em>
   Too Many Cooks
  </em>
  -style psychedelic nightmare that sets a high bar for the future of analog horror games.

  Every so often, a survival horror game comes along that presents a challenging narrative, forcing players to confront the dark underbelly of human existence.
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of those titles, presenting a story of sexual assault and survivor's guilt that treats both its subject matter and its audience with the respect both deserve. At a basic level,
  <em>
   Mouthwashing
  </em>
  is a hallucinatory walking simulator with strong horror elements, but its narrative and character development are so strong as to stick with players long after rolling credits.

  Like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  before it, the remake of
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  takes a beloved classic in the survival horror genre and almost perfectly reimagines it for a modern audience. There were doubts about Bloober Team's ability to handle remaking such a beloved game in the genre, which makes its careful "threading of the needle" with the remake all the more worth celebrating.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  improves on the visuals and combat of the original, and the ways it honors and enhances the best-in-class narrative of its source material set an example that future video game remakes should follow.

  The most recent PS1-style survival horror to release in 2024,
  <em>

  is an entirely different type of experience from contemporaries such as

   Crow Country

  <em>
   Sorry, We're Closed

  is a survival horror title with equal parts style and substance. Together with a unique combat system that switches from third-person navigation to first-person shooting,

   Sorry, We're Closed
  </em>
  is an indie title with a narrative and gameplay that punch well above their weight.

  <em>
   Still Wakes The Deep
  </em>
  might be an experience on the shorter side, but the sheer amount of tension and thrills it offers in its roughly 4-hour campaign is arguably worth the price of admission. Dealing with an oil refinery in the middle of an ocean,
  <em>
   Still Wakes The Deep
  </em>
  puts players into a creaky, claustrophobic setting and pits them against a Lovecraftian monster, forcing players to question their own sanity as reality seemingly crumbles around them. It's a tightly-paced and atmospheric title that ends up being one of the year's most engrossing games despite its shorter runtime.

  is a game that should be talked about by more horror game fans, delivering one of the year's most compelling setups for the genre. Imagining what would happen if
  <em>

  uses its Atari aesthetic to great effect. The concept of a haunted or cursed game cartridge allows

  Some weapons in

   <em>

   </em>
  </strong>
  can feel a tad iffy compared to others, and some players out there might question just why that is. Considering
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  constantly re-invents itself and its combat, it’s no surprise that weapons from 2017 feel a lot different when compared to the guns from 2024, and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s introduction of hitscan and bullet drop weapons will be essential to understanding how the game works.

  players can rejoice over the return of hitscan weapons in Chapter 6 Season 1, and players who want to understand what this actually means, and why it's so important for the gameplay going forward, can find the answers they need below. With Fortnite usually having two different types of weapons hitscan and projectile-based, it's essential to understand each of them to know what to look out for when it comes to shooting at targets with confidence.

  What is hitscan in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ? Hitscan weapons have non-physical bullets that are fired from the weapon. This means that the bullets fired have no travel time or gravity to pull on, so aiming at a target and pulling the trigger will see that target take damage instantly if a weapon is aiming at them. In essence, a hitscan weapon requires players to point and shoot at their enemy to see damage dealt, without having to compensate for distance, and players just need to make sure their reticle and bloom is on the target.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":278} -->
 <p>
  Hitscans were incredibly popular across shooter games because all players needed to do was aim and shoot with no calculations on whether or not players had to aim up to compensate for gravity. Hitscan weapons were removed for the entirety of Chapter 5, but Chapter 6 Season 1 has brought hitscan weapons back into the meta, where every weapon is now hitscan so that players can enjoy a classic approach to gameplay without the requirement for more modern gunplay.

 <p>
  The valid reasons that people preferred hitscan weapons came from the fact that bullet drop requires calculation, realism, and often unreliable exaggeration, whereas hitscan was a simplicity of point at a target and shoot them, so many rejoice over the return of hitscan weapons in Chapter 6 Season 1's Battle Royale.

  Projectile weapons fire a physical bullet that has gravity physics attached to it, meaning that the bullet fired has to be compensated for speed and travel distance before the bullet drops from the pull of gravity. Projectile weapons were in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  with Snipers and DMRs, but they have since been completely removed for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  with Chapter 6 Season 1 and the impending arrival of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG.

 <p>
  This means that a bullet drop weapon shoots out projectiles that shoot actual bullets that have to travel to opponents, providing time to dodge or even miss despite aiming at them since players will need to adjust their aim based on distance. Projectile weapons dominated
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>

  In
  <em>

  , a catastrophic event known as the
  <strong>

      <title>Hazard is Guaranteed to Have Interesting Interactions With Another Overwatch 2 Tank</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/overwatch-2-tank-hazard-omnic-ramattra-relationship-lore-good-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Season 14 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  will introduce Hazard as the newest member of the tank role. Teased at the end of the Season 13 trailer and featured in an origin story, gameplay trailer, and comic, anticipation for the Scottish hero is steadily rising. Hazard is already drawing attention for having one of the most intriguing backstories of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's playable characters.

 <p>
  While Hazard's kit, blending brawl and dive features with a partial wall-climbing ability, is undoubtedly attractive, lore enthusiasts are also in for a treat. In
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Hazard's backstory reveals that the accident that resulted in the loss of both his feet and an arm was due to an
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  jet crashing into a building nearby. Interestingly, this defining moment from his past may result in an incredibly unique dynamic between him and Ramattra.

  Hazard Is The First Playable Character To Have Romantic Relations With An Omnic
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hazard's Hero Trailer makes it clear that he shares a deep bond with his found family, a group of vandal hackers who helped him enhance his body with cybernetic modifications. An esports.gg interview with Hazard's voice actor, Conor McLeod, and Blizzard's senior narrative designer, Jude Stacey, revealed that Hazard met his partner through the group. According to Stacey, Susannah, typically referred to as Susie, an Omnic member of The Phreaks, is Hazard's romantic partner. This aligns with Susie's concern in the trailer when he injects himself with a substance without knowing its full effects.

 <p>
  Hazard isn't necessarily the first human to have an Omnic as a partner, as seen in a few instances throughout the game's lore. For instance, an Omnic is seen with its arms wrapped around a human woman during Mondatta's speech in the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  animated short Alive. An even briefer scene in Sombra's Origin Story depicts a woman holding an Omnic in what could be interpreted as an intimate manner. Regardless, Hazard is the first playable character to openly partner with an Omnic, which could mean the community may soon glean more about the ongoing oppression of Omnics and their relationships with humans.

 <p>
  While Blizzard's narrative designers confirm that Hazard gets along well with characters like Ashe and Kiriko, he has strained relationships with many of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's roster members, as he holds little regard for Overwatch, Talon, or the Junkers. His distaste for Overwatch makes sense, considering his belief that "the system" has failed him and because Overwatch was directly involved in the accident that nearly killed him. Talon is also confirmed to be on his bad side due to the Phreaks being anti-establishment, in addition to the Junkers, who are known to be anti-Omnic.

 <p>
  With few characters and organizations seemingly on friendly terms with him and the criminal group known as The Phreaks becoming a force to be reckoned with, Hazard extending favor to the Omnics may attract the interest of Ramattra, the leader of the Omnic liberation group Null Sector. Though
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's PvE missions are at an indefinite standstill, and Ramattra's story is left ambiguous due to this, in-game interactions and stories could explore The Phreaks' growing reputation. Their recent heist at Oasis University, where they stole a sample of vanadium ferrofluid, could be a surprising yet satisfying way to further Ramattra's narrative.

  In
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  lore, after the Awakening and the end of the Omnic Crisis, Omnics were freed from the malevolent AI programming of Anubis and granted sentience. Though this conflict ended, a new issue arose because most humanity did not acknowledge Omnics as their equals. With Ramattra vowing to forge a path to co-existence and peace, even if it means this must be achieved through battle, Hazard's ongoing relationship with Susie may spark a connection between them.

 <p>
  In-game, this, at the very least, guarantees engaging voice lines between the characters as they are both open to using violence and supporting Omnic rights. Though Role Queue modes might limit their interactions, dialogue between the two, whether on opposing teams or the same team in
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  <em>

  </em>
  's 6v6 playtests or Open Queue should still be compelling. Unfortunately, Hazard's limited trial weekend didn't feature voice interactions with other characters, but fans can expect new exchanges to follow when he officially debuts in Season 14.

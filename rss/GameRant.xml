  One of the problems many families face is choosing a game that is both fun and age-appropriate. Engaging with games enables the entire family to enjoy quality time together and makes for a great weekend activity. In fact, according to UNICEF, parents should play video games with their kids as it will bring them together and create a stronger bond.

  Released in early 2024 by Holy Cap,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Promenade
   </em>
  </strong>
  is suitable for children over 7 years old, allowing the family, including the little ones, to bond while playing. What makes this game family-friendly is the colorful and dynamic characters. The game’s goal is to collect different types of objects and solve all kinds of puzzles to progress to the next level. It's easy and user-friendly, and the calming video game music will eliminate stress levels during gameplay.

 <p>
  In addition, the game has an interactive, easy-to-follow story. It's ideal for beginners who aren't used to video games, but features enough depth to entertain more experienced gamers too. The end of the game is a bit more challenging, but in a good way—nothing too difficult. It also ends with a positive message by making a throwback to where it all began, leaving players feeling proud of their efforts.

  fans love it or hate it, there is no middle ground. This option is ideal for patient gamers or for people who are trying to get better in that area. The game’s goal is to roleplay as a chef and prepare meal orders in a chaotic kitchen environment. What makes

  Developed by House House,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Untitled Goose Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an easy game to play, allowing people to be a loose goose for a day. It’s very entertaining, funny, relaxing, and appropriate for all ages. Players mention how hilarious the game is, as it allows them, while playing as a goose, to go around an Model Village and take items (without permission) from other people’s gardens, and then use them to cause mischief. It’s a short game, but it’s easily replayable with different people.

      <title>Monster Hunter Now: Best Gunlance Build for High Damage</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While not every weapon appeared at launch for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Now
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the
  <strong>
   Gunlance
  </strong>
  was introduced not too long afterward. A mix between defense and offense, these weapons are best suited to those who love to be up close to monsters but also need to have some firepower to augment their power, and this build guide takes advantage of all of these traits.

 <p>
  Having said that, there are so many
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  monster parts that you need to get in order to put together the very best Gunlance build, and it's not just for the main weapon. Some of the monsters featured here are high-value targets, but this build is catered toward targets that are more commonly found outside of special events. Therefore, while Magnamalo and Coral Pukei-Pukei might be rarer hunts, you'll also be hunting Diablos and Banbaro to complete this set. Here is the
  <strong>
   best high-damage Gunlance build, complete with options for all the available Driftsmelt slots.

 <p>
  The best weapon for a
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  Gunlance build is the
  <strong>
   Sinister Gunlance
  </strong>
  . This is a long shelling Blast-element weapon with the Partbreaker ability available at Grade 8, which helps increase the part damage it deals to breakable parts. The Blast-element slowly builds up over time, before erupting to deal a huge amount of damage all at once to the monster, reducing its health significantly, and thus making tougher hunts a little easier. The downside of this build is that it does require you to hunt many Magnamalos for the weapon, and several other armor parts also require tracking down
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  's flagship beast multiple times. Thankfully, you can track this monster via the Paintball Tracker.

 <p>
  Since we've already got a point in
  <strong>
   Partbreaker
  </strong>
  , we might as well increase it as far as we can, along with
  <strong>
   Weakness Exploit
  </strong>
  to make triggering an explosion with your Blast element more likely whenever you hit a monster's weak spot.
  <strong>
   Lock On
  </strong>
  will ensure that you can target a specific weak spot more easily, thus guaranteeing the aforementioned affinity synergy.

 <p>
  The other skills generally appear a bit sooner than the Weakness Exploit ability this
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  Gunlance build is centered around. For example, a couple of points in
  <strong>
   Blast Attack
  </strong>
  from the Vambraces speeds up the rate at which the Blast effect builds up.
  <strong>
   Sneak Attack
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Offensive Guard,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Concentration
  </strong>
  are all nice to have, as they add more options to deal damage, build up your affinity in various conditions, or build your Special meter quickly.

 <p>
  The good thing about this build is that several Driftsmelt Slots are open at relatively low weapon ranks, meaning you can take advantage of this often-overlooked mechanic early on. All the recommended skills here are featured in the main build, so the intention is to elevate their levels further via Driftsmelt Slots.

 <p>
  Even though Concentration, Offensive Guard, and Sneak Attack were merely abilities accompanying more important ones in the base build, extra points for them via Driftsmelt Slots make the whole build come together nicely. The exception here is
  <strong>
   Critical Eye
  </strong>
  , which is an ability that gives you a flat increase to your affinity, but without the need to hit a weak spot. Here are our recommendations for Driftsmelt Slots for the best

  <strong>
   Strategy
  </strong>
  games are very fun, but the reality is that they're not for everyone, as they require tons of patience, a good deal of tactical planning, and a deep love for sitting back and waiting for things to play out. Given how popular this genre is, there are strategy games touching on almost every subject. From ancient civilizations and World War 2, to futuristic interplanetary conflicts.

   <em>
    Pikmin
   </em>
  </strong>
  starts when Captain Olimar crashes on a mysterious planet. He soon realizes that the only way to escape is by collecting his ship's parts, which have been scattered all over the surface. To help Olimar, players will have to grow different Pikmin, as well as control them as a group to perform various tasks.

 <p>
  This sounds simpler than it is, as players will have to plan out how they want their Pikmin to do their tasks and move the various objects required to progress through the game. Many objects are labeled with a number, which indicates the Pikmin required to lift them. While the control scheme itself isn't too complex or different in technical terms, the methods to control Olimar and the Pikmin to work together and achieve a mutual goal is very unique, and something that was rarely seen in other titles at the time.

  Set in a futuristic environment, specifically in the city of Markov Geist,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Frozen Synapse
   </strong>
  </em>
  presents players with a unique concept, where the world has merged with a form of virtual reality inhabited by beings referred to as shapeforms. This game features turn-based combat that requires a ton of patience and careful strategic planning to ensure victory within the smallest possible timeframe.

  During combat, players will have to give orders to a small squad of armed combatants in an effort to eliminate all opposing units. What makes
  <em>
   Frozen Synapse
  </em>
  so interesting and unique in terms of control schemes is not related to technical concepts, but rather to how players can control their units. Proposed pathways are marked in green, and players must use the top-down view to their advantage to find blind spots and areas of coverage to both attack enemies and avoid being hit. Controlling units in this game is a unique experience, as it doesn't feel as unrestricted as other titles, which might sound tedious, but somehow, it works.

  Depending on players' decisions, the world will change for good or for worse, stemming from the choices of a kind, or an evil god. As players carry out godly acts, they will get more and more believers, which in turn makes them more powerful and able to control several aspects of the experience. One thing in terms of the control scheme that players would probably not have been able to figure out straight away without the tutorial, is that holding down the mouse on a specific resource like wood allows for its continuous collection. Moreover, the cursor is often represented as a hand, which can only be interpreted as the hand of God.

  The events behind
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tom Clancy's Endwar
   </strong>
  </em>
  begin when a nuclear terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia kills six million people and interrupts the Middle East's commercial activities, including the import and export of oil. Soon after, the world plunges into a concerning energy crisis. Naturally, when something like this happens, chaos soon follows, and the world loses any established order that was ever in place. One curious thing about this title is that it was turn-based for handheld consoles, such as the Nintendo DS, and real-time for other platforms.

  What makes
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Endwar
  </em>
  's control scheme so unique, is that often, the controller is not needed. This game implemented voice commands that players could use to tell their units who or what to attack by simply using specific words. This not only helped add much more realism to the gaming experience but also gave the title a unique approach to combat and strategy.

  While this game doesn't feature unique control schemes during the majority of the story, there is a very fun and hard-to-discover feature inside it. During the game's loading screen, players will see a small pixel art Byleth at the bottom. While it might be hard to believe, it's possible to control him and determine where he runs with the Nintendo Switch's gyro sensor. This feature, while not at all useful in practical terms, is a fun little detail the developers added, and that took many players hundreds of hours to discover.

    Strands

  is a short daily word puzzle from the New York Times Games. It is a more challenging version of your average word search; you are not given any of the words or the theme. You only get one little clue, and sometimes that clue is pretty helpful, while other times it is not.

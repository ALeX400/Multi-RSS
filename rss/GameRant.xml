	<em>
	 <strong>
		Helldivers 2
	 </strong>
	</em>
	continues to release timely updates and fixes to address stability and balance concerns. With over 12 million players across two major platforms, the live-service game has reached the point where the community is hungry for new content. The monthly supply of new weapons, armor, and emotes with premium Warbonds does only a little to stop the cooperative shooter from becoming stale and repetitive. Most players who have been playing since launch are burning out from grinding the same missions and objectives against the same two factions.

	In that regard, the Illuminate is heavily rumored to be returning as the third faction in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	. The
	<strong>
	 highly advanced alien civilization
	</strong>
	was known for using terrifying psionic, shielding, and teleporting abilities. Recognized as the hardest faction to beat in the first game, the Illuminate disappeared from the pages of history after the last war. Their return would certainly be a feature players would love in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	. Here is everything to know about the faction that once had the most sophisticated military and space technology in the galaxy.

	 </strong>
	 Using Dark Fluid to destroy the Meridia planet was necessary to eradicate the Terminid super colony. However, the latest Helldivers 2 major order may have opened a doorway for the Illuminate to come through. WIth more leaks making headway, the high-tech alien faction could possibly make its debut in Helldivers 2 this month as part of game's live service roadmap.

 <p>
	The Illuminate was one of the three factions you fought in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 1
	</em>
	to safeguard Super Earth as the sole galactic government. They were a highly sophisticated alien faction with heightened intelligence that hailed from the planet of
	<strong>
	 Squ'bai Shrine
	</strong>
	, a beautiful homeworld covered in lush forests and foliage with large marshes and bodies of water.

 <p>
	The Illuminate originated as an aquatic species hundreds of millenniums ago. Also called the
	<strong>
	 Squ'ith
	</strong>
	, they had blue skin with long, elastic-like appendages for limbs below their ceremonial robes. In terms of design, they were a cross between the Protoss faction from
	<em>
	 StarCraft
	</em>
	, the Fallen from
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	, and the Covenant from
	<em>
	 Halo
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	During the events of the original
	<em>
	 Helldivers
	</em>
	, which took place around a hundred years before
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	, the Illuminate faction was considered a serious threat to humankind. This was because they were producing deadly weapons and military technology on a large scale. They had also built a large neural network that allowed them to warp across the galaxy to potentially unleash weapons of mass destruction on planets without giving them time to react.

 <p>
	The Illuminate were eventually beaten by Super Earth at the end of
	<em>
	 Helldivers
	</em>
	, thanks to the bravery of the Helldivers Corp.
	<em>
	</em>
	Their military was dismantled, and all technology was taken away. What happened to the Illuminate afterward, however, is an interesting question that the Super Earth lore and backstory do not clearly answer.

 <p>
	There are two branching narratives here: the Illuminate were either destroyed or exiled. If you speak with the female officer in front of the engineering bay on your ship, she will sometimes mention how "we eradicated the Illuminate" in the previous war. However, the news broadcast on your ship will sometimes have a ticker that states the Illuminate were exiled after agreeing to hand over their technology to Super Earth.

 <p>
	It should be noted that Cyberstan (Valdis Sector) exists in the galactic campaign map of
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	. This was another faction that was defeated in the first game, but their members were enslaved in the mines. However, the Illuminate's homeworld (Squ'bai Shrine) is nowhere to be found. It is possible that the Illuminate used their space-travel technology to teleport their planet into another galaxy as part of their exile terms.

 <p>
	Unlike the predominantly ranged Automatons and the melee Terminids in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	, the Illuminate were equipped to fight both melee and ranged combat. They were expert tacticians adept at splitting up or boxing in teams by using energy walls and barriers.

 <p>
	Most of their units utilized highly advanced shields to absorb incoming damage. The Shield Generator Pack, one of the best backpack stratagems in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	, is probably based on that same technology. Having to first destroy their shields before piercing their armor made them a nightmare to fight in groups.

 <p>
	The Illuminate also utilized cloaking technology to make their units invisible on the battlefield. Similar to Stalkers, they would cloak themselves to get close enough for a surprise attack. However, the real threat was the long-ranged cloaked snipers who were notorious for killing players off-screen.

 <p>
	Furthermore, the elite Illuminate enemies could use terrifying psionic abilities to control other sentient beings or technology. Most players tend to think that the Rocket Devastators are the worst projectile-type enemy in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	. Imagine having to beat a psionic Illuminate while also shooting down their mind-controlled homing explosive projectiles.

	There have been numerous instances in the past couple of months that suggest that the Illuminate are nearly ready to return in
	<em>
	 Helldivers 2
	</em>
	. Both the Ministry of Truth and Arrowhead Game Studios are denying all such claims, but the evidence just keeps piling up. It does look like the Squ'ith are on their way to seek vengeance from Super Earth for exiling them a century ago. They may even already be here.

	<li>
	 A previous patch was data-mined to reveal several references to the Illuminate as a new faction in
	 <em>
		Helldivers 2
	 </em>
	 . It should be noted that while data-mined files can be leftover code, some of the weapons, such as the explosive crossbow were eventually released.
	</li>
	<li>
	 A famed
	 <em>
		Helldivers 2
	 </em>
	 leaker who accurately revealed the weapon icons of Factory Striders returned to leak in-game models of an Illuminate melee unit that could be the Apprentice.
	</li>
	<li>
	 The same leaker also shared a close-up image of an Illuminate enemy this week.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Then there are the blue lights in the sky. Several players have shared gameplay footage in the past month of a strange blue energy beam firing at them from above. Some players may have even spotted a cloaked Illuminate ship.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Following the destruction of Meredia in
	 <em>
		Helldivers 2
	 </em>
	 , a planet-sized black hole has appeared in its place. The major order succeeded in eradicating the Terminid super colony, but it is now widely believed that the black hole is, in fact, a portal or wormhole. Something could possibly come through, and that may be the entry point of the high-tech Illuminate faction.

	The Illuminate have not been seen or heard from since the last war almost a hundred years ago. Whether they were exterminated or exiled to the deepest corners of space, the Illuminate were far too technically advanced to be beaten so easily.

	Do not believe in the Ministry of Truth. There is ample evidence to suggest that the Illuminate
	<em>

	Throughout the world of
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Fallout 4
	 </em>
	</strong>
	, players will encounter a wide variety of quests and characters, including those of special NPCs who can serve as companions. Each companion has their own unique quests for the player, as well as an overall affinity rating that can be improved by performing actions these characters will view positively.
 </p>

 <p>
	When a certain affinity score with a given companion has been reached, players will typically unlock a special quest, which (upon completion) grants a special companion perk unique to that particular character. For
	<strong>
	 Nick Valentine
	</strong>
	, the synth robot detective of Diamond City, his quest is "Long Time Coming." The quest will become available to players once they have both killed Conrad Kellog and achieved an affinity rating of at least 750 with Nick as a companion. The quest involves tracking down an old nemesis of Valentine's who was responsible for killing the detective's pre-war lover, Jennifer Lands.

	 Nick Valentine
	</strong>
	at the start of the quest. This can only happen when the player has reached a high enough affinity with Nick and after the completion of the quest "Dangerous Minds," in which players hunt down and kill Kellogg as part of the main story.

	Players can choose to kill Eddie or allow Nick to do so, but either way,

 <p>
	While it's true that many early video games were overly complex and hard to learn (particularly in the strategy game genre), many games from the earlier days of the industry were arguably more elegant in their design than many modern titles. This was especially so in smaller arcade games like
	<em>
	 Gauntlet
	</em>
	and first-person shooters like
	<em>
	 DOOM
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Quake
	</em>
	. It could be said that this simplicity and elegance were derived from the limitations developers suffered from at the time and the smaller games they developed as a result.
 </p>

	AAA games nowadays are often large and bloated, or set on creating linear experiences that are best when played for the first time. As a result, the smaller indie games with affordable price tags, minimalist styles, and small installation sizes are often great sources of repeatable entertainment.

	is a tiny, simple indie game about rolling dice. The premise of this clicker/strategy/rogue-like game is simple: the player is given 2500 rolls of the dice to score as many points as they possibly can.

 <p>
	This simple premise, however, leads to a great deal of strategic decision-making that's made replayable through the game's procedural generation and variety of upgrades.
	<em>
	 Roll
	</em>
	is a simple, strategic puzzle with an elegant design and a considerable amount of depth, all in spite of its tiny stature.

	This smash-hit rogue-lite is as simple as games can get, featuring a combat system in which the player's character automatically attacks their enemies. The only input the player has in
	<em>

	This minimalist, accessible turn-based strategy game plays similarly to
	<em>
	 Darkest Dungeon
	</em>
	. Despite the similar gameplay loop, though,
	<em>
	 Tinyfolks
	</em>
	stands out on its own with its brilliant chip-tune soundtrack, simple pixel-art style, and unique push-your-luck mechanic.
	<em>
	 Tinyfolks
	</em>
	takes the gameplay of
	<em>
	 Darkest Dungeon
	</em>
	and distills it down into an elegant loop that's easy to learn and highly replayable.

	In the game, players build up a burgeoning town, recruit and upgrade new adventurers, and then send those adventurers into various dungeons. Each dungeon in
	<em>
	 Tinyfolks
	</em>
	features its own unique set of enemies and its own distinct boss, each of which offers a new challenge.
	<em>
	 Tinyfolks
	</em>
	is a smaller and easier-to-learn interpretation of
	<em>
	 Darkest Dungeon
	</em>
	that, despite its relatively simple gameplay, manages to be highly replayable with its variety of strategies, difficulties, and challenge modes.

	Although the tower defense genre typically suffers from a lack of variance, the number of strategies, playable maps, and difficulty modes in

	, players must learn the strengths and weaknesses of both their enemies and their own turrets. Players must also concern themselves with their economy, as having a solid income can result in more towers and upgrades to help defend against the balloon swarm.

	<em>
	 Tiny Rogues
	</em>
	is a bullet-Hell dungeon crawler with a rogue-lite structure and an abundance of playable characters. These characters often impact how a player builds their run, but the game's variety of fun traits also help to inject some diversity. The sheer number of potential builds, random encounters, and alternate bosses make
	<em>
	 Tiny Rogues
	</em>
	one of the most replayable rogue-lites available.

	 Balatro

	is a small and affordable indie game with a minimalist pixel art style and a simplistic user interface that's remarkably easy to read.

	<em>
	 Balatro
	</em>
	is a Poker-themed rogue-like deck-builder in which players create Poker hands in several score-attack-styled rounds. Throughout each run of the game, players upgrade and manipulate their deck of cards to create new strategies and acquire unique Joker cards that offer their own unique powers. With several challenges to complete, an abundance of starting decks, and a variety of systems that facilitate diverse strategies,
	<em>
	 Balatro
	</em>
	's replay value is astonishing.

	Still Hunt is one of the new exotic weapons added in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Destiny 2: The Final Shape
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. It's a Solar Sniper Rifle with a very special perk: it can shoot Golden Gun shots. This weapon is the only gun in the game so far that can Super damage, and it's almost everything players expect it to be.

	Before you get too excited about this gun, you're going to need to spend a bit of time exploring the Pale Heart first. Thankfully, it's not that hard to get, and luck isn't involved at all compared to some of
	<em>
	 Destiny 2's
	</em>
	other exotic weapons.

	First, you'll need to finish
	<em>
	 The Final Shape's
	</em>
	campaign. In fact, much of the expansion's content is locked behind campaign completion, so if you want to get everything the Pale Heart has to offer, you have to blast your way into the Witness' monolith and finish the story mode.

 <p>
	Once the campaign is done, you'll be sent back to the old Tower inside the Pale Heart, which has now been converted into a base of operations. The second thing you need to do is finish the first part of the
	<strong>
	 Destined Heroes
	</strong>
	exotic quest called
	<strong>
	 Queens, Part I
	</strong>
	. After that, talk to Cayde in the old Tower to start the

	 Wild Card quest
	</strong>
	. Finish Wild Card to get the Still Hunt Sniper Rifle.

 <p>
	Still Hunt has a couple of things going for it. Stats-wise, it's a solid sniper rifle out of the box. With a base zoom of only 40, fans of
	<em>
	 Destiny 2's
	</em>
	Crucible modes already have a lot to be excited about. Low zoom values make sniper rifles much easier to handle, especially on maps that don't have long sight lines. It's a little bit slower compared to meta sniper rifles like Mercurial Overreach, but the difference isn't that big, especially since its intrinsic
	<strong>
	 Sharpshooter
	</strong>
	trait gives it a passive bonus to ADS speed.

	<strong>
	 Cayde's Retribution
	</strong>
	is the gun's exotic trait. Every time players land Precision Hits or collect Orbs of Power, the weapon's Super bar will fill up. Once full, hold your reload button, and the gun will load three Golden Gun shots that can deal Precision Damage. Against enemies in the Pale Heart, it can deal up to 110k damage per headshot. This synergizes with
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	Hunter exotics that buff Supers, such as Celestial Nighthawk. However, it does seem to do less damage than the actual Golden Super Gun.

	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	incorporates a variety of gameplay into its exploration quests. Players not only have the chance to try out various gameplay mechanics, but they can also learn more about the lore that
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is built upon. Usually, the main exploration quests unlock certain areas on the map for players, but there are side quests that dabble in the exploration mechanic as well.

 <p>
	When The Moonlight Shines In The Forest is one of these side quests. It takes Rovers on a mission to find
	<strong>
	 artificial moons
	</strong>
	scattered around the region. The side quest is only available after completing the main exploration quest: When The Forest Is No Longer Dim. It is only after completing it will the side quest pop up on the map near
	<strong>
	 Violet Banyan
	</strong>
	.

	Head over to any of the Resonance Beacons near Violet Banyan to find Qiaomo. The navigation should pop up on the mini map when you’re closer to the tree, and you’ll find her at the base of it. She’ll ask you to find some Artificial Moons
	<strong>
	</strong>
	that are scattered around
	<strong>
	 Thorny Passage
	</strong>
	and
	<strong>
	 Violet Banyan
	</strong>
	. You can follow this guide to locate all four of them.

	<strong>
	 river that divides Thorny Passage from Violet Banyan

	, and toward the tip of the river, there will be a small pool. The Artificial Moon will be lying in the middle. You can just pick it up and head for the next location on the map.

	The next location will be
	<strong>
	 south
	</strong>
	of the
	<strong>
	 Huanglong-Dim Forest-Giant Banyan Resonance Beacon
	</strong>
	. There will be a cave, and players only need to fly down into it to grab the Artificial Moon piece. There will be quite a few enemies near the entrance of the hole, so be careful not to agitate them.

	After collecting all the Artificial Moon pieces, just head back to Qiaomo on the indicated quest marker. She’ll affix the moons, and the quest will be complete. You’ll then be awarded the Trophy along with

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Sims can work a full-time job, do freelance work, or own their own business. It's fun to explore all of these options because they can mix things up for players who have grown bored of their save files and it unlocks tons of gameplay possibilities.

  There are various packs in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  that allow gamers to own a business, such as a vet clinic, a restaurant, or a retail store. While running a business, players must transfer funds between their Sim's household funds and the business funds so they put money into the business for expenses and take out some of it once they make a profit.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Throne and Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players can customize their Weapon Skills and even specialize them until they're different from the base ones.
  <strong>
   Staff skills
  </strong>
  are some of the most destructive and useful skills in the whole game, and having a dedicated build that prioritizes this powerful skill branch will turn characters into powerful Ranged DPS.

  But just hurling spells mindlessly is not enough to make a good build. The following are the best staff skills to unlock, alongside their Specialization perks and all the details players need to know about these spells before they decide to use Growth Books on them.

 <p>
  Serial Fire Bombs is the basic spell all mages can cast by using the Staff and is one of the skills with the most specialization Perks. Choosing the right ones will turn a single-shot static spell with channeling into an instant cast triple shot that can change targets, and cause severe damage as the player moves.

 <p>
  The Projectile Speed Increased and Radius Increased perks allow the spell to cause severe area damage, as well as the Burning effect. The instant Casting allows players to eliminate the casting time and the Mobility perk will allow them to cast while they move, which is incredibly useful for both PvE and PvP.

 <p>
  With the addition of another Consecutive Use thanks to investing in said perk, this spell guarantees heavy area damage, as well as stacking Burning on the enemies, which synergizes with a Fire damage centered build. Inferno Wave will create a huge explosion of fire that will damage enemies in a circular area, and cause a lingering effect for a few seconds, burning affected enemies and causing even more DoT.

 <p>
  This is a targeted spell, and the radius of the explosion is a 3m circle centered on the target. Enemies affected by the Burning after effect will receive two additional stacks of burning after receiving a Heavy Attack from any source. This spell is not only useful for blasting crowds of enemies in PvE but also to clear out PvP enemies that are closing the gap into melee range.

 <p>
  The Burning Smokescreen specialization turns the Frost Smokescreen into a burning wave of fire that leaves a trail where the player used to be and transports it to a safe location in the directional keys they were pressing. The area is 4m wide, causing a lingering Burning Effect for 5 seconds, damaging any enemy that goes through it.

 <p>
  The Additional Damage perk adds 50% of the base spell damage to the DoT area damage, which is not distributed but directly affects each target separately, causing even more harm to approaching enemies. Overall, it's a great spell to have, stacking even more burning to deal even more damage, and triggering good Spell Synergies with skills like Fire Ball Barrage.

 <p>
  Players should definitely pick this for Add Clear and stopping power since the Chain Thunder specialization perk will turn this spell into a massive asset for any wannabe wizard. It causes serious damage that bounces between targets, has the lowest cooldown of all Staff spells, and also transfers damage between targets. In PvP, this spell shines like a bright light causing serious damage to pesky Melee opponents.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  , having a reliable source of area damage is key to survival, and Chain Thunder fits that role with extreme efficiency since it creates blasting pools of Electric damage each time it bounces among enemies, and this can have serious consequences for groups of Mobs or players trying to corner a Staff user. It is one of the best spells to have, and it's recommended to focus on improving it as soon as possible.

 <p>
  Fireball Barrage is a mid-tier spell from the Staff weapon skill tree, and with the correct improvements, it turns into a powerful damage-dealing machine. After channeling in a static position for a brief period (0.8 seconds) the spell charges and starts shooting a barrage of fireballs to the designated target. If the spell is improved with the Fireball Frenzy perk, it will shoot an additional fireball per Burning stack on the target.

 <p>
  That is why this spell synergizes so well with Inferno Wave, Burning Smokescreen, and Serial Fire Bombs since they can potentially add 15 charges of Burning to a single target, and that means after casting all Fireball Barrage, players will shoot something like a finishing move that will destroy any monster (or player). The ideal combo is starting with Serial Fire Bombs and Inferno Wave, since they're instant casted thanks to the build that's recommended, then use Burning Smokescreen to gain distance and cast Fireball Barrage from a safe distance. This will potentially delete an opponent in a PvP match.

  Ice Spear Bombardment is the altered form of the Ice Spear Staff Spell, and a powerful skill that is capable of dealing a lot of damage at incredible speeds, as well as causing slow and Bind if players pick the right perks for it.

 <p>
  This is a single target spell, and each Ice Spear hurled at the opponent will cause 70% base damage to the enemy plus 5% of the base ability damage per hit, and has an 80% chance to cause Weaken effect Slow on the opponent, as well as applying Frost to the target. Frost also slows by an extra 20% which decays over 2 seconds, and also reduces attack speed by the same amount. It also triggers Conduction on the Electric-based spells and is equal to the "Wet" effect caused by rain. As players can see, it is quite a useful spell and should be prioritized for upgrading the second it is unlocked.

  The slowest to cast, but highest in damage of all Staff Active Skills, and like Chain Lightning, it can be improved with Damage Transfer Perks to ensure it bounces between targets, causing severe damage to them. It requires a little bit of channeling but causes 630% base spell damage plus an additional 50% of the ability damage score, and bounces off up to 5 targets.

 <p>
  Harnessing the power of lightning, the Staff User will be able to clear out enemies in quick succession, and thanks to the Consecutive Use perk, it can use it a second time as an instant cast, which also bounces between targets, causing even more damage. The only downside is the 2 seconds of casting time and the need to be static, but the power of this spell is worth it. It is the best Staff skill, even better than Infernal Meteor, which is unlocked at level 50.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans think that Greninja, Delphox, and Chesnaught deserve to get Mega Evolutions in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  . There's a lot about
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  that fans don't know yet, such as which Pokemon will be the game's starters. But one piece of information has already been confirmed, and it has been getting the community very excited ever since.

 <p>
  This information is the return of Mega Evolutions, an announcement that was received very positively, since this is one of the most popular
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  gimmicks. Introduced with the release of
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  , this evolution is a temporary state that a critter unlocks when using its corresponding Mega Stone. Despite being a mechanic introduced more than 10 years ago, there are only 46 Pokemon that are able to access this form, and 48 different Mega Evolutions, which opens up a world of possibilities for the next game in the series.

 <p>
  Several fans such as Redditor vetikkehvajegkanhete believe that Greninja, Delphox, and Chesnaught, the Gen 6 starters, should get Mega Evolutions in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  . They suggest that instead of the game featuring regional forms of monsters that aren't from Kalos, players could instead have access to the trio's Mega Evolutions. It's worth remembering that
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is set in Lumiose City, one of the cities of Kalos, and that fans have already shown what it would be like if the Gen 6 starters had Mega Evos.

  In the comments section, other
  <em>

  fans approved of the OP's idea. In one of the replies, a Redditor suggested that
  <em>

  </em>
  could have both, with non-Kalos starters introduced at the beginning of the game, and along the way, trainers having the chance to encounter Froakie, Fennekin, and Chespin. Another comment noted that Mega Evolutions was something created to revisit old critters with new ideas, so since the release of
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  was a decade ago, it would be a good opportunity.

 <p>
  With the confirmation that Mega Evolutions will be back in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , fans have been making a wide variety of fanart picturing critters that could finally get the treatment. There's no shortage of very creative ideas featuring Mega Evolutions for Zoroark, and other pocket monsters like Flygon, Electrode, Yanmega, and Klinklang. Since
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  comes out in 2025, fans wait to discover which critters will receive new Mega Evolutions, and whether the Kalos trio will receive new forms.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>

  player has modded the game to make every NPC extremely drunk, all the time, with hilarious results. A compilation shows off some of the funniest moments as a stone-cold sober Arthur Morgan watches

  </em>
  NPCs topple over drunk all around him as the player progresses through the story.

 <p>
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  , like many other games, has a system in which players can drink alcohol and get their character drunk. The more alcohol is imbibed, the harder it becomes to control Arthur Morgan or John Marston, but the drunkenness isn't limited to the player character. Now, this player has shown what it would be like if everyone around Arthur was hammered all the time.

  Content creator and Reddit user Blurbss shared a brief GIF compiling some of the funniest moments they experienced, in addition to a longer playthrough video. The scenes are hilarious, with the effect impacting NPCs in gameplay and cutscenes alike. As a result, both common and important moments don't work the way they should when the NPCs are drunk. At the saloon, Lenny falls straight off his chair when he's supposed to be just starting to drink with Arthur, while a lady that's supposed to help with taking a bath is too busy throwing up on the floor to do anything else. Meanwhile, a variety of NPCs can be seen falling over trying to open doors and keeling off of cliffs due to vomiting. Arguably the most hilarious sights, though, are little Jack Marston falling flat on his face and Dutch staggering backwards through a cutscene until he falls out of the shot.

  As one might expect, fans of the game are finding this mod to be hilarious. Several made jokes, like how the deluxe bath is only deluxe because the lady doesn't throw up in the tub, while others mused that it was made even funnier by Arthur being the only non-drunk person around. Several fans wanted to play the mod for themselves, but at the moment, it seems that the mod isn't available to the public. Thankfully, this isn't the only hilarious mod for
  <em>

  , so players looking to inject a little madness into their game can still have some fun.

  While the modding scene for

   RDR

  gets an all-drunk mod, however, remains to be seen.

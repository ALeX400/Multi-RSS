  The iconic
  <strong>
   Bethesda
  </strong>
  voice actor, Wes Johnson, who was in critical condition over the past few days, has shared a heartfelt message with fans, saying he is in the process of recovering and will be back to acting. The actor received an overwhelming wave of support from Bethesda’s video game fans, who raised money to pay for his medical bills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wes Johnson is a popular figure among Bethesda video game enthusiasts, as the actor has voiced many iconic characters in games like
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  —playing Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness—
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . In addition to video games, Johnson has worked in radio and television roles. While volunteering at a National Alzheimer's Foundation event, Johnson was found unconscious and taken to the hospital, prompting the community to rally in support. Now, after a couple of days in the hospital, the popular voice actor has finally provided an update.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a video uploaded to a GoFundMe page, Wes Johnson shared an emotional message with Bethesda’s video game fans, reflecting on this unexpected situation he had to endure. The actor commented on the rumors circulating about his death: “It was very close, very close,” he said. Johnson explained that he is alive thanks to his family, who acted quickly. His wife called the hotel where Johnson was staying to see why he hadn’t shown up at the Alzheimer’s Association event (where he was invited as a host), and when Johnson was found by security, he was “nearly dead.”

  As Johnson recalled in the video, the Bethesda voice actor was in critical condition and had to be put into a coma. He also shared with fans how emotional it was to find out his friends had launched the crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe. “I found out there's a lot of love in this world that I didn't know was out there,” the actor said, showing his gratitude to his friends and fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gaming community, which has enjoyed Wes Johnson’s iconic Bethesda characters, showed its support by raising the staggering sum of $175,363, surpassing the initial goal of $50,000. Johnson reassures players that he is getting better and will be back, though he acknowledges it will take a while to fully recover. After the news of his incident and the rumors about his death, fans and the gaming community as a whole can rest assured that Wes Johnson is alive and looking forward to jumping back into acting.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter World
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been out for over five years now, having seen an active lifespan of PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game was even expanded upon in 2020 with the DLC
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
  </em>
  . Throughout both the base game and its subsequent updates, there have been lots of great options for players who favor the Long Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to other Blademaster weapons in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise, the Long Sword has an incredible range at the expense of being able to disrupt fellow players' movements. A great Long Sword requires many positive attributes, from healthy Sharpness to increased Affinity for critical hits, so users should keep their eye out for these six weapons in the game.
 </p>

  </strong>
  : It's a sad time for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  fans, as mere weeks remain before the release of the next installment in the series,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds.
  </em>
  While this means many fans will be starting from scratch in terms of building up their arsenals of weapons and armor, others might take the time to relish having acquired all the best weapons of a given type. Luckily for Long Sword users, there are quite a few extra weapons we have yet to cover in this article. For one last hurrah before
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  releases, let's see a few key Long Swords that might be some of the best in the game, if it wasn't for the difficulty of obtaining them.

  Those who think the Gold Rathian is a tough monster to fight should wait until they face the Silver Rathalos. This Long Sword is the fully-upgraded version of Wyvern Blade "Indigo," boasting more than 100 base power than its previous form. Aside from its powerful attack of 891, it reaches Purple Sharpness with a decent chunk of White Sharpness to boot, as well as strong Fire Element and 20% Affinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is this one of the best Fire Element Long Swords in the game, but its design is also great to show off during online hunts. Every fellow hunter will know that equipping this Long Sword is proof of a hunter who's been through it all — with "it" meaning dozens upon dozens of Silver Rathalos hunts.

  Hellish Slasher may have an incredible design, but crafting it is going to be quite a challenge for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  players. Players must complete several Master Rank Arena quests, requiring four types of coins: Hero King, Glavenus, Nargacuga, and Banbaro. The Hero King is the rarest, given out as a reward for tough Arena quests, while the others are dropped from the specific monster's Arena quests.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for its stats, the Hellish Slasher doesn't have the best Dragon Element, with only 180. However, its base attack is a staggering 924, with a large amount of White Sharpness. It also has one level 4 slot for decorations, which players can use to greatly increase Attack, Defense, or any other skill in their arsenal they'd like an extra boost in.

 <p>
  There are only a few weapons in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  that can't be crafted; rather, they can only be obtained from completing special quests. "The Fury of El Dorado" is one of those quests, a Siege Event allowing 16 players total to team up against the gold-plated Elder Dragon, Kulve Taroth. Similar to "Safi'jiiva Siege," this quest rotates on a 2-week rotation, giving players only a limited amount of time to complete it.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those who do take down the Elder Dragon, the Kjarr Sword "Fire" is a great reward, but has a few downsides. Its Sharpness only has slivers of each color before mostly hitting red, and its base Attack is only 627. However, its Fire damage is 390, and it comes with 20% Affinity. Best of all, it includes a point towards the Critical Element skill, making its Fire Element damage even stronger.

  Only players with the expansion pack
  <em>
   Iceborne
  </em>
  will have access to this fearsome Long Sword. It requires materials from the Frostfang Barioth, a Barioth variant that's tougher and even chillier than its regular form. Being able to conquer the beast enough times to accrue materials for the Adularia Edge will earn players one of the best Long Swords in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  What the Adularia Edge boasts over all other features is its
  <strong>
   sharpness
  </strong>
  , with a small amount of purple and a vast amount of white. Additionally, the weapon also has good attack at 891, strong Ice element at 540, and even 15% affinity. It will, unfortunately, require at least two battles against the Master Rank Frostfang Barioth to nab three Frostfang Tickets.

  The Lunastra is a fearsome Elder Dragon that resembles the Teostra, a familiar monster to many
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  veterans. However, it operates on a lot of the same principles as its red-colored cousin, and even offers some of the best Blast weapons in the entire game. This weapon has
  <strong>
   340 in Blast along with good white sharpness, 825 attack, and 10% affinity.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes this a very difficult weapon to obtain, however, is that it requires two Lunastra Lashes, which are rare drops from the Elder Dragon if hunters are unable to chop off its tail. Their best shot in another way is obtaining one as a quest reward, though the odds of that aren't in hunters' favor. Long Sword users should get used to aiming for the monster's tail.

  The Divine Slasher's previous iteration, the Supremacy Blade, can only be crafted from material acquired from Low-Rank and High-Rank Arena quests. It may not look like much on the surface, with only a smidge of blue-colored Sharpness and no Elements, though it does boast 693 base Attack and +20 Defense, but this weapon's strength is all in the armor loadouts of hunters.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all five points of Handicraft, players with a Divine Slasher will go from decent Sharpness to a solid amount of white and blue. Plus, the Ability Free-Elem/Ammo-Up will unlock the Dragon Element in the weapon, making it perhaps one of the best options in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  to take down Elder Dragons, who are often weak to the Dragon Element themselves.

  The Kulu-Ya-Ku is one of the earliest monsters encountered in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  , but its late-game materials allow players to craft one of the strongest Long Swords. The Rafiq al-Nasr II, upgraded from the Rafiq al-Nasr I, consists of Master Rank materials from the Bird Wyvern, offering 825 base Attack, an impressive amount of white Sharpness, and 25% Affinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, hunters with Free-Elem/Ammo-Up can unlock 420 Sleep in the weapon, which will work wonders in knocking monsters unconscious in the course of battle. Particularly when paired with Attack Up skills and Razor Sharp to maintain strength, the Rafiq al-Nasr II will make for great support when playing online with other hunters.

  As far as weapons go in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  , the Defender Katana is one of the easiest to start crafting, as it only requires Iron Ore. Future upgrades will test players' luck with rewards, requiring an Immortal Dragonscale from Nergigante and a Commendation from completing certain difficult quests throughout the game's main story.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final weapon, however, is one of the most useful and versatile in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
  </em>
  , boasting incredible Sharpness, 300 Blast power, and 726 base attack power. It's far from the most overpowered weapon in the game, but it's one of the most reliable out of the many Long Swords available to craft in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series.

  Sadly, players will have to make it all the way to Master Rank in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
  </em>
  to acquire this weapon. Its base level and its upgrade are no easy feats to craft, requiring materials from Viper Tobi-Kadachi, Acidic Glavenus, and Great Girros. However, the end result is a weapon with impressive stats across the board.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the Defender Katana, the Crimson Viperfang outmatches it with 825 base attack power. Instead of Blast, the Crimson Viperfang also utilizes the Paralysis status effect, with a bonus 15% affinity to increase the chances of critical hits. It also comes with two slots for Decorations, which can come in handy for players assembling the perfect mixed Armor set.

  Many weapon types in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  have the benefit of a Gold Rathian weapon, which are often the best Poison-coated weapons in the game. The same goes for the Wyvern Blade "Luna," the final upgraded form of the Gold Rathian's Long Sword, which comes with 420 Poison power, 10% Affinity, 957 Attack power, and strong Sharpness.
 </p>
 <p>
  When combined with the Handicraft skill, Wyvern Blade "Luna" users will also experience the rare benefit of Purple-level Sharpness, as well as a useful amount of White-level below it. Thankfully, players will only need to fight the Gold Rathian to upgrade it to its final form, with previous upgrades made of regular Rathian and Pink Rathian materials.

  Brachydios is one of the most iconic monsters in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise, and it made a triumphant return in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  . Brachydios' variant, Raging Brachydios, also appeared in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World.
  </em>
  While defeating it is quite a challenge, the reward that Long Sword users will receive is one of the best weapons in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  At 990 base Attack and 270 Blast power, Long Sword users will be dealing tons of damage with every swing of the Lightbreak Edge, potentially breaking monster parts more easily thanks to the effects of Blast damage. The Lightbreak Edge also includes two slots, which can fit a Handicraft Jewel 4, boosting its decent Sharpness into the Purple-level.

  This entry is sort of cheating, considering that these weapons can only be obtained by completing the "Safi'jiiva Siege" quest. By teaming up with up to 16 players to take on this Elder Dragon, players will be rewarded with a unique weapon for every weapon type and every possible Element, which comes at a huge benefit for Long Sword users.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each of these special Safi'jiiva Long Swords comes with similar stats: 891 base Attack, 5% Affinity, a single level 4 slot, evenly-spaced Sharpness levels, and an Element or Status Effect of 180 power. Some fan favorites of this bunch include the Poison-coated Safi'jiiva Viperblade or the Blast Safi'jiiva Shatterblade, but any make for good selections to hunt with.

  The good news is that the best Long Sword in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
  </em>
  is the Fatalis Zaggespanon, with 1155 base Attack power, 150 Dragon power, and Sharpness stretching up to Purple-level. The only downside is the abysmal Affinity at -30%, as well as one other caveat: players have to fight the Fatalis to obtain this weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As one of the oldest Elder Dragons in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise, defeating the Fatalis enough times to obtain rare material like the Fatalis Evil Eye could send a player of any experience level to their wit's end. However, it's all worth it to get this weapon, which also boasts two level 4 slots, though it will be quite a tribulation to fully upgrade it.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is the latest game to feature the “Star-Spangled Man with a Plan” and in it it’s clear as day how synonymous and iconic the vibranium shield is to Captain America. Enhanced via a Super-Soldier Serum, Steve Rogers is a red, white, and blue defender of freedom who hurls a nearly indestructible shield. A “man out of time,” Steve fought in World War 2 before being inadvertently frozen in ice until the modern generation, where he became an Avenger and embraced contemporary ideologies and technology. Interestingly,

  , though its stunningly life-like cinematics demonstrate that its graphics will be impressive. However, what Captain America’s gameplay might look like isn’t necessarily ambiguous if he already wields the round vibranium shield—distinct as it is from the ordinary kite shield he originally had equipped— and can ricochet it between Hydra soldiers. That said, while in-game combat with the shield needs to be exhilarating as it’ll likely be what delineates him most from
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  ’s three other playable characters, Captain America’s attacks shouldn’t be restricted to it.

  Tony Stark is still charismatic, intelligent, and hilarious even when he’s not in an Iron Man suit, and Steve Rogers is still compassionate and morally righteous even when he isn’t carrying a shield. Nonetheless, both Iron Man and Captain America are far more interesting when they have their iconic gear.
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  has already given a small glimpse of what Captain America’s combat style may look like, and unsurprisingly it has him bouncing the shield off enemies and catching it in midair or using it in close-quarters combat to cut an enemy down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shield is even wielded in both shots of Captain America and Black Panther’s heated encounter. Now, it’s obviously expected that Captain America would hoist his shield aloft seeing as it’s such an overpowered tool. But, if given a chance, it would be neat if a shield throw could result in it being lodged in a wall or object with Steve then having a move set independent of it until players wrench it free.
 </p>
 <h3 id="captain-america-must-be-worthy-of-the-shield-but-not-beholden-to-it">
  Captain America Must Be Worthy of the Shield, But Not Beholden to It
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the encounter between Steve Rogers and Azzuri that was revealed, antagonistic dialogue illustrates that Black Panther does not find Captain America worthy of the shield. This infers that Azzuri knows it’s made of vibranium.
 </p>
 <p>
  Assuming that this is their first meeting in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  ’s canon, Azzuri must not know Steve is a good man. Of course, Skydance may be flipping the script and not portraying Captain America as the traditional, squeaky-clean do-gooder that he normally is, but that is yet to be seen. Either way, it would be spectacular if Captain America’s gameplay incorporated attacks that didn’t require the shield to be his safety net.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The only glaring and immediate issue with such gameplay is if players choose to leave the shield where it is in the environment and progress onward it would break immersion to enter a cutscene and have the shield suddenly reappear on Steve’s back or arm.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Indeed, each playable character in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  seems to have their combat playstyle boiled down to their equipment: Gabriel wielding a rifle suggests that he’ll be a marksman archetype; Nanali wielding what appears to be a retractable baton suggests she’ll have melee combat and maybe dabble in stealth as she’s a Wakandan spy; Black Panther might exclusively revolve around stealth mechanics considering how his scenes in the story trailer depict him; and Captain America may be fully offensive with the shield doing all the work for him. If so, Steve’s story will have quite a lot of heavy lifting to do to prove to Azzuri that he is the right man to wield it.

  Like its predecessor,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has every intention of being as historically accurate as possible to immerse players in a realistic rendition of medieval Bohemia. In light of that, the game aims to depict the culture of that period along with key locations that contributed significantly to that culture, most notably Kuttenberg. Today, Kuttenberg is a district town of the Central Bohemian region, 70 km east of Prague. During
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's time, it was a very economically and politically important location serving as the game's largest urban environment.

  Game Rant recently had an opportunity to interview Warhorse Studios about

  's portrayal of Kuttenberg, including its history, what inspired its inclusion in the game, and the unique gameplay opportunities it offers. During the interview, Warhorse's PR manager, Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, was pleased to divulge more information about the historic location and what players can expect from it in the game.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Can you elaborate on Kuttenberg's role in medieval Bohemia and its economic and political importance during that era?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Kuttenberg (or Kutna Hora in Czech) was indeed a city of great power and economic, political, and even military significance. The reason for that can be boiled down to one single word: silver. As a silver mining town, it hoarded huge amounts of wealth which attracted traders, miners, and the like, but also made it a valuable strategic target during wartime.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1403, the time in which
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  takes place, it was already occupied by the invading King Sigismund of Hungary.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's Henry will have to navigate the town but will need to stay on his toes. I find it fascinating how the people of Bohemia were confused and divided over the question of which king to support: the rightful but idle one, or the (seemingly) strong but invading one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What inspired the decision to make Kuttenberg a prominent setting in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   , and how does the location enhance the game's narrative?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  It made a lot of sense for
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's story. Kuttenberg was mentioned several times in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  and offered a very intriguing and interesting narrative to explore, especially as we discovered that King Sigismund himself was in town during that period. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that, as a player, you'll encounter far more prominent "celebrities" than you did in the first game. Prague, while internationally more renowned, simply did not make sense for the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: In what ways does Kuttenberg's historical context influence the storyline and character development in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Kuttenberg and the events that took place there is an integral part of the story in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  . I don't want to spoil too much, but I sometimes compare
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  to movies like
  <em>
   Inglourious Basterds
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Ocean's Eleven

  <strong>
   Q: When it came to recreating Kuttenberg in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   , I'm assuming there was plenty of collaboration with historians, architects, and/or local experts. What was that process like?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I honestly think that recreating Kuttenberg in its entirety was the biggest challenge we faced. It wasn't just about reconstructing its 1403 appearance, but also about researching what life was like in the town - how people lived and behaved, and who actually lived there, among many other details. To achieve this, our in-house historian ventured far and wide, collaborating with the town's archives and with museums, universities, other historians, and various experts. The goal was to create a depiction that's as accurate as possible within the constraints of a video game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, not everything is possible, and compromises have to be made here and there. But overall, we're very excited to share what we've created. The town itself, its mayor, and officials are equally enthusiastic and are already preparing guided tours and other events for fan tourists they expect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Were there any surprising discoveries about Kuttenberg's history that influenced
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   's game design or storytelling?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I don't think anything caught us completely off guard. However, it was fascinating to decipher which nobleman aligned with which side of the conflict. Politics seem to follow the same pattern - saying many words without really saying anything in particular.

   Q: How does the urban landscape of Kuttenberg in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   differ from the more rural settings of the first game, and what unique gameplay opportunities does it offer?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  It does differ quite a lot. First of all, as you mentioned in your question, it's a much more urban setting compared to the more rural environments of the first game — or even the first map you venture to (the area around Trosky Castle). Kuttenberg is a significant part of the second map in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , but it's not the only thing you'll explore. There are other fortifications, castles, a massive monastery, villages, and more. It's also a more "industrious" setting, featuring numerous silver smelters and related activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What challenges did the development team face in digitally reconstructing the complex architecture and urban layout of medieval Kuttenberg in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  The most obvious challenge was that not all buildings survived, and some of the ones that did survive look completely different today. This meant we had to dive deep into research. Sometimes we found solid evidence, while other times we had to create our own interpretations. A good example is the former town hall of Kuttenberg, which we know had an astronomical clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since the town hall is now destroyed and no one knows what it actually looked like, we took inspiration from similar buildings in the region and created our own version. The most important thing was to make it feel and look authentic while staying as true to the period as possible. You could say this about every aspect of
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Are there any landmarks in Kuttenberg that were pivotal during the medieval period? If so, how are they represented and/or utilized in
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I'd compare it to the gold rush in the United States. Silver and the mines were the easiest answer to the city's prominence. Everything revolved around silver, and "regular" citizens were, more or less, able to achieve riches that had previously been accessible only to the nobility. Naturally, this led to a clash as the nobility began losing influence, and "regular" people became entrepreneurs if the circumstances were right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, there's more to it. The wealth also allowed the city to construct monuments and massive manors. The most notable is probably the Italian Court, which served as the king's seat (when he wasn't in the capital) and functioned as the kingdom's central bank. All the silver was brought to this place and minted into coins.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: How did the team approach the representation of daily life, culture, and societal norms of Kuttenberg's residents during
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   's time period?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  The most challenging part was figuring out how "regular Joe" lived his daily life. The reason is simple: scribes and chroniclers typically focused on celebrities rather than common folk. We approached this challenge the same way we tackled everything else — research, research, research.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, the Middle Ages are extremely well-documented here in the Czech Republic, so we were able to consult many local experts on the topic. We also contacted historians and specialists from other countries to compare findings and double-check our interpretations. This collaborative approach helped us piece together a more accurate and well-rounded picture of everyday life during that time, in this specific location.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: How does
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
   's depiction of Kuttenberg balance historical accuracy with engaging gameplay and an original story?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I'd say this point doesn't just apply to the town of Kuttenberg but reflects how we approach crafting the game as a whole. Authenticity and immersion are our ultimate goals, but we never sacrifice fun gameplay for the sake of realism if it doesn't enhance the experience. Like the first game,
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  remains a video game designed to bring joy and excitement to players, while maintaining a very authentic and immersive approach. For example, you won't die of the flu just because you stood in the rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, if you want to use potions, you'll need to craft them through a detailed minigame. It's definitely a "lean back and delve into it" type of experience rather than a quick and easy fix kind of game. That said, it's still a deep RPG. Nothing in the game is forced on you; it's entirely up to the player to decide which of the tools we provide you want to use, which way you want to go, and how you shape Henry.

  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  is an IP with a long history. Beginning as a series of novels written by Frank Herbert, it has since spun off into an extended literary universe, multiple film and television adaptations, board and video games, and more. The upcoming multiplayer survival game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dune: Awakening
   </strong>
  </em>
  will tell an original story set on Arrakis, but will also incorporate elements from both the original novels and the recent Denis Villeneuve films.

  Legendary Entertainment, Junior explained, ended up having a large influence on the game's development, as both teams worked to ensure that the game's portrayal of Arrakis lined up with the films'. "[Villeneuve] needed to introduce Fremen in sietches before we did, and that's something that we worked around so that our launch scope wouldn't include the Fremen," Junior revealed. Other aspects of the game that drew inspiration from the films include the design of the ornithopters and the game's musical score, which pays homage to Hans Zimmer's work on
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dune Part Two.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Junior revealed, the
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  team did not work with the creators of the HBO series
  <em>
   Dune: Prophecy
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  which aired in December 2024. "I just saw it for the first time in December with everybody else," the executive producer said. "We didn't get early access." However, Junior did indicate that he would potentially be interested in incorporating elements from
  <em>
   Dune: Prophecy
  </em>
  post-launch, particularly the series' lore regarding the founding of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood.

  Staying accurate to the lore of
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  resulted in some unexpected challenges for the
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  development team, Junior revealed. They knew from the start that they wanted shooting to be an element in the game, but large-scale firearms are uncommon in the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  universe due to the development of the powerful Holtzman shield. Ultimately, with help from the Herbert estate, they came up with a system based around shooting darts instead of bullets. As Junior described,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    "How to make a game with shooting that works with Dune, that's lore accurate, when you can't have guns? You need to have guns in order to make a shooter, so we worked with Legendary Entertainment and the Herbert estate to come up with the dart system that we use. These are low velocity projectiles that we shoot."
   </em>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Ultimately, the team was able to use the challenge presented by the Holtzman shield to their advantage. They were able to add another touch of lore, the sound of a "projectile spinning as it's interacting with the shield," which players can use as a warning to dodge out of the way in both PVP and PVE combat. This is something, said Junior, that the
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  team would never have been able to implement if they stuck with standard bullets rather than devising the dart system. Their commitment to lore accuracy was ultimately to the game's benefit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who have been fans of the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  series for a long time will be able to truly step inside the world of
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  thanks to the
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  team's commitment to accuracy. Working together with Frank Herbert's estate and Legendary Entertainment, they have created an Arrakis that is faithful to the books and the films but also features some original elements. Players will get to experience this take on one of the world's most iconic science fiction settings when
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  launches later in 2025.

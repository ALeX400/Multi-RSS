 <p>
  In most
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, you can easily redeem codes even if you enter the game for the first time. It is important for the developers not to confuse players, so they implement this function in the same way as in other titles. Therefore, experienced players quickly understand how to redeem codes in any game they enter. In
  <em>
   Craft Tower Defense
  </em>
  , this option is placed in the settings menu, so even beginners will figure out what's what. However, if you still need a hint, you can simply use our guide below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Firstly, launch
   <em>
    Craft Tower Defense
   </em>
   in
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the right middle part of the screen, you will see the “Settings” button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on this button, and head to the Codes tab, where you will see an input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above codes in this field and click the Redeem button.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, you will receive a reward. However, if you are unable to redeem the code, check if you entered it correctly and if there are no extra spaces, as these are some of the most common mistakes when redeeming codes. Keep in mind that codes may become expired over time, so hurry up and redeem them while they are still active.

      <title>Rumor: 5 Xbox Games Leaked for Switch 2</title>

    Summary

   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Nintendo Switch 2 may received Xbox-owned titles.
     </li>
     <li>
      Diablo 4, Fallout 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Starfield are all rumored for the console.
     </li>

      Only a handful of indie games and a new Mario Kart game have been officially confirmed for the Switch 2 so far.

 <p>
  The latest rumors about potential upcoming
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  games suggest that five Xbox-owned titles could be coming to the home console/handheld hybrid at some point down the line. Nintendo has finally shown its Switch 2 console to the world, but only a handful of games are confirmed to be in development for the console at the time of this writing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various indie games have declared for the Switch 2, while Nintendo itself has only confirmed that a new
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  game is in development for the console. In the meantime, rumors have been swirling about how aggressively other companies might be supporting the Switch 2, with Ubisoft said to have over half a dozen games in development for the system, and Microsoft said to be planning a great deal of support for it as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now leaker eXtas1s has potentially provided more insight on Microsoft's plans for the Switch 2. If the leaks are to be believed,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  might all be in development for the Switch 2.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  in particular appears to be most likely to come to the Switch 2, which makes sense. After all, Blizzard brought
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  to the original Switch back in 2018, and since
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is a cross-gen game, it shouldn't have much trouble running on Nintendo's new handheld.

 <p>
  As far as the Bethesda games go, it really wouldn't be all that surprising to see them on the Switch 2 either. Bethesda brought
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  to the original Switch, and so it makes sense for it to bring some of its other games to the console's successor.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  has remained hugely popular since its release in 2015, and while
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  hasn't enjoyed quite the same longevity, it has still been a massive sales and critical success for the company. Expanding
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  to the Switch 2 will give even more gamers the opportunity to try it out, potentially growing interest in the IP in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator
  </em>
  are likely to raise the most eyebrows when it comes to rumored Switch 2 games, but this isn't the first time that we've heard of these titles potentially going multi-platform. There have been persistent rumors that
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  is leaving Xbox exclusivity behind this year, with
  <em>
   The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  apparently planned not just for the Switch 2, but the PS5 as well. Time will tell if there is any truth to these rumors, but more information should come to light in the months ahead.

 <p>
  Two massive developments have occurred recently within the video game industry: Nintendo finally revealed the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  for the first time and Sony has begun porting more and more
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  games (including its exclusives) to other consoles, like PC and the original Switch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, this has led gamers around the world to wonder: which PlayStation 5 games would be perfect for Nintendo’s new hybrid console? Whether they are beloved IPs owned by Sony or popular third-party titles by other companies, there are a lot of solid video games to choose from, but the following eight are the most fitting ones so far.

 <p>
  The idea of Sony actually porting one of its first-party exclusives may sound unrealistic at first, but it’s crucial to keep in mind that the company has already done this, seeing as the spin-off
  <em>
   Lego Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is available on both Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. So, after introducing Nintendo audiences to the incredible
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series, the next logical step would be to release the first game in the series on the Switch 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon: Zero Dawn Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  would be perfect for the new system, seeing as this is an expansive open world game with a unique premise, a rich world and intimidating robotic enemies that star in thrilling action sequences. Of course, the Nintendo Switch 2 may be much less powerful than the PS5, but this can be amended by making it look more like the original PS4 release.

  Nintendo’s systems are known for their colorful 2D and 3D platformers that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults, with some of the most prominent examples being the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  series, the
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  series or even the
  <em>
   Banjo-Kazooie
  </em>
  series. So, why not port another adorable platforming mascot that would feel right at home on the Nintendo Switch 2? After all, it would fit the brand perfectly.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sackboy: A Big Adventure
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the most recent entry in the
  <em>
   LittleBigPlanet
  </em>
  series and, while it’s the first one to lack the option to create custom levels, it is still a surprisingly good 3D platformer with creative levels and a charming protagonist. There’s no doubt that Nintendo’s usual audiences would love to experience a game as good as
  <em>
   Sackboy: A Big Adventure
  </em>
  on their new consoles in the near future

  Audiences and critics recently fell in love with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Team ASOBI’s incredibly nostalgic and endlessly creative 3D platformer. It even earned the Game of the Year award at the Game Awards 2025, where the game’s director revealed that the team was inspired by the original
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  . While this game is still only available on PlayStation 5, Sony should definitely take advantage of its newfound popularity by releasing it on other systems, and the Nintendo Switch 2 should be one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Needless to say,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  ’s gameplay does rely a lot on the PS5’s unique hardware, so Team ASOBI and Sony would need to tweak it around quite a bit in order to make it work on other consoles. Its beautiful graphics would also likely get a significant downgrade, but they are so colorful and stylized that the game would still look great on Switch 2. And, if everything else fails, Sony could try porting other games in the series to the console, like
  <em>
   Astro Bot Rescue Mission
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Astro’s Playroom
  </em>
  .

  The original
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man
  </em>
  , by Insomniac Games, was praised by fans and critics alike due to its many positive qualities, with one of them being its old-school approach to open world gameplay that doesn’t overwhelm players with too many side quests, which is made even better by Spidey’s amazing web swinging controls. This game is very easy to pick up and complete at a reasonable place, a play style that would feel right at home on a handheld device like the Nintendo Switch 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a precedent for this idea, since Sony has already ported
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  to Steam, which made it compatible with the Steam Deck, and the game is very fun and satisfying to play on that handheld. Of course, it would most likely look a lot less impressive on Nintendo’s new console, maybe to the level of the original PS4 release, but it would play so well on it that it’s definitely worth the sacrifice.

  The
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  (formerly
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  ) series has a lot of excellent titles that would be perfect for the Nintendo Switch 2, due to its whacky characters, over-the-top set pieces, accessible RPG gameplay and addictive mini-games. Any game in this series would be perfect for the new hybrid console, but the most recent one,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
   </em>
  </strong>
  , would be the best place to start.
 </p>
 <p>
  This bizarre Hawaii-based adventure represents what the
  <em>
   Like a Dragon

  franchise is all about, and it has been so well received by fans and critics that it’s often considered to be one of the best video games of 2024. Curiously enough,
  <em>
   Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  also features a “creature”-taming RPG mini-game called Sujimon Battle, an obvious parody of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise that would definitely appeal to longtime fans of Nintendo RPGs.

  The Nintendo Switch is one of the best places to play hack-and-slash games, due to Nintendo’s close partnership with PlatinumGames, which has led to the creation of many high-quality exclusives, like
  <em>
   Bayonetta 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Astral Chain
  </em>
  . This must have made Capcom realize that the Switch is perfect for playing hack-and-slash games on the go, as it released new versions of the first three
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  games on that console.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the company stopped at
  <em>
   DMC3
  </em>
  , most likely due to the Switch’s relatively less powerful hardware. This means that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be the ideal place to release the remaining mainline entries in the series,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 4
  </em>
  and, most importantly,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition
   </em>
  </strong>
  , an AAA hack-and-slash adventure that already thrived on PlayStation 5, due to its multiple playable characters, catchy soundtrack, deep combat system and challenging bosses.

   <em>
    Hi-Fi Rush
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most distinct games on the market, as it seamlessly combines high-octane hack-and-slash combat with precise rhythmic gameplay, while also having one of the best cartoony art styles ever implemented in a video game. This Tango Gameworks project was originally exclusive to Xbox and PC, but it was ported over to PlayStation 5 in 2024, where it managed to sell even more copies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many Nintendo fans feel like
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  would play really well on the Nintendo Switch, due to its colorful presentation and creative gameplay. However, despite the fact that numerous rumors about an eventual Switch port have existed for over a year, this hasn’t materialized yet. Maybe it couldn’t be done because of that console’s weaker hardware, so now it would be the perfect time to port
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  to its successor, especially after KRAFTON saved both Tango Gameworks and the

   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most influential video games of the current generation, as FromSoftware’s first foray into the open world genre has changed the industry forever. What’s especially interesting is that Hidetaka Miyazaki confirmed that
  <em>
   Elden Ring’s
  </em>
  open-ended approach to open world gameplay was inspired by Nintendo’s
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , which had a similar impact on the market five years before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of these similarities,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  would definitely resonate with Nintendo fans, especially those who have enjoyed experiencing open world games on the original Switch. Of course, it feels almost impossible to port a world as ambitious and massive as this one on the Nintendo Switch 2, but it’s important to remember that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is also available on PlayStation 4 (albeit in a compromised state), so it could still work well on the new hybrid console with some solid optimization.

      <title>After Dungeons and Dragons Updates the Artificer, It's Time for One New Class Type</title>

  The ongoing rollout of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dungeons and Dragons
   </em>
  </strong>
  ' 2024 ruleset has already given fans plenty to play and experiment with. The
  <em>
   Player's Handbook
  </em>
  made major changes to classes, species, and background; the
  <em>
   Dungeon Master's Guide
  </em>
  added new magic items to the game and introduced rules for crafting and building bases; and the
  <em>
   Monster Manual
  </em>
  looks like it will make designing combat encounters easier than ever when it is released on February 18. A pleasant surprise for many players, recent playtest material for the 2024 rules also made updates to one of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  5e's most unique classes.

  It was announced this past December that the Artificer class would be returning to the game via Unearthed Arcana. The Artificer is a type of tinkerer that uses their intellect to create mechanical devices and magic items to aid them on their adventure. The class joins the Wizard as the second Intelligence caster in the game. Having another Intelligence-based class will add some needed diversity to the playstyles offered in
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  2024. Since Strength, Wisdom, Dexterity, and Charisma each serve as the recommended primary attribute for multiple classes, non-Wizard characters with an Intelligence focus are almost non-existent. Once the Artificer moves past
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's playtest phase, Wizards of the Coast should consider designing a class based around another underappreciated ability score.

  Constitution is an ability score that receives plenty of attention from players but little attention from D&amp;D's designers. Boosting a character's Constitution score is essential for anyone looking to play combat-oriented classes like paladins, barbarians, and fighters in
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  , since the score determines a character's hit points. However, with the score tied into such an integral part of a character's stat block — as well as the frequency of Constitution saving throws in the average adventure —
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  makes Constitution a high priority ability score for every other class in the game, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  For an ability score that necessitates so much attention, though, Constitution is easily the game's most passive stat. Every other ability score in the game plays a role in characters' skill bonuses, attack rolls, or spell effectiveness — or all of the above. There are no skills associated with Constitution. It is only used to determine a character's hit points and the modifier they have on saving throws for Constitution and concentration. This makes Constitution an important ability score, but one that bestows little satisfaction on anyone who chooses to prioritize it.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-a-constitution-focused-class-could-make-big-waves">
  How a Constitution-Focused Class Could Make Big Waves
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are tank classes in
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  that already place an emphasis on high Constitution scores, but they primarily rely upon other scores to fulfill their roles. Paladins, barbarians, and fighters typically showcase their Strength more than any other stat. Charisma is also important for paladins, and Dexterity is used as the primary attack modifier for certain fighter builds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wizards of the Coast could give Constitution its time in the sun while simultaneously adding more variety to the frontlines during combat with one solution: a dedicated tank class. Unlike the previously mentioned classes, this new class wouldn't be a half tank that primarily focuses on DPS. Its role would instead be to draw attention and absorb damage for teammates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only would this class naturally need the number of hit points that a high constitution score would grant, but WOTC could incorporate the Constitution score into its combat abilities as well. Imagine having a bulwark of a character on the battlefield that could channel their Constitution to draw aggro, stun enemies instead of just damaging them, and give AC bonuses to allies. This would make Constitution a genuinely desirable and intriguing stat instead of one that players just feel obligated to sink one of their higher scores into.
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  2024 would benefit from adding greater diversity to its classes, and exploring a Constitution-focused class could be a great way to do so.

  The launch price of the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  won't affect the console's sales all that much, according to one video game industry analyst. Previous Nintendo consoles like the original Switch and Wii have been cheaper than the competition from Xbox and Sony, but without an official price tag, fans are unsure if that trend will hold up. Still, at least one expert in the field doesn't believe cost will play a big role in how the Nintendo Switch 2 sells at launch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nintendo finally unveiled its upcoming console on January 16, confirming many of the rumors that had arisen about the system before the official unveiling. Before long, the Switch 2 trailer surpassed the PS5 announcement's view count, but as excited as fans may be, there are still some unanswered questions. One of the most notable is how much the console will cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an interview with Games Radar, Mat Piscatella, Executive Director of Games at research firm Circana, said he doesn't believe launch pricing will matter much in terms of how well the Switch 2 will sell. According to Piscatella, the fans who tend to buy Nintendo hardware early usually aren't too sensitive to price. Consequently, he believes the console will sell well "as long as the launch price isn't some egregious amount." It seems Nintendo may have similar expectations, as early supply chain indicators suggest the company is ready to sell over 20 million Switch 2 units in 2025.

  Piscatella is less bullish than Nintendo regarding how well the console will sell, but still expects impressive first-year figures. In the interview, he estimated Switch 2 sales would fall between 14 and 17 million units worldwide in 2025. Surpassing the original Switch would be a difficult feat, even if the new console offers substantial performance upgrades. The Switch became the best-selling console of all time in the U.S. in late 2024, toppling the PlayStation 2 from its long-standing position at the top. That leaves a lot of room for the Switch 2 to see great sales figures but still not exceed its predecessor.

  Another research company, DFC Intelligence, previously predicted the Switch 2 would dominate the next console generation, and that report didn't list price as a strong influencing factor, either. It seems analysts believe an early launch and hype among the fanbase are enough to propel sales to impressive heights, regardless of how much the system costs. The official price likely won't become clear until the April 2 Direct, when Nintendo will reveal more about the Switch 2.

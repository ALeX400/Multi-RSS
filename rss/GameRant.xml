 <p>
  In the medieval colony sim,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Norland
   </em>
  </strong>
  , peasants and lords alike need an alcoholic drink every few days in order to fulfill the Rest requirement. If these drinks aren't available due to scarcity or cost, then moods will go down leading to further consequences.

 <p>
  There are three types of alcohol in
  <em>
   Norland
  </em>
  , these being
  <strong>
   Flavorful Ale
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Beer
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Moonshine
  </strong>
  . All citizens prefer the drinks in that order and will always purchase and drink the best if it is available. Drinking Flavorful Ale grants increased mood, whereas Moonshine decreases mood. All alcohol in
  <em>
   Norland
  </em>
  is made in the Brewery, and it is sold to peasants at the Tavern. Lords, on the other hand, take it for free from the Warehouse.

  Thankfully, no knowledge is required to build a Brewery or Tavern in
  <em>
   Norland
  </em>
  , so this is a fairly easy process. The Brewery can be found in the Production buildings, whereas the Tavern is found in the Service buildings.

 <p>
  As long as players have a lord assigned at the hall to issue building commands, both the Brewery and Tavern will go up fairly quickly. However, players should wait until they are ready to harvest Rutabaga, which is required to produce the most basic alcohol in the game, Moonshine.

  For the Brewery to operate, players will need to have a manager assigned to instruct workers. They can also upgrade the Brewery to increase production.

  Moonshine is the most rudimentary alcohol in the game, and it is made out of Rutabaga, which also happens to be the simplest type of food in
  <em>
   Norland

 <p>
  To produce Rutabaga, only two steps need to be followed, although of course it takes a little bit of time for the harvest to come in:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Build a Rutabaga Field on a patch of land with high fertility, and make sure a lord is set to manage the Hall so that builders will be directed to start construction.
  </li>
  <li>
   Assign a lord to manage the completed field and wait for the harvest to come in every few days.
  </li>

 <p>
  To have enough Rutabaga to eat and turn into Moonshine, players will want to build at least two Rutabaga Fields.

  As players progress through this medieval simulation game, they will eventually want to offer their citizens something tastier than Moonshine, and this is where Beer comes in handy. There are two ingredients required to make Beer in
  <em>
   Norland
  </em>
  : Rye and Hops, but knowledge from books is needed to produce both of these.

 <p>
  The game's May 2024 reveal prompted some backlash over its representation of feudal Japan. A lot of that criticism was directed at the inclusion of African samurai Yasuke as one of the two protagonists of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . Despite the fact that he's the first-ever playable character in the franchise to be based on a real person, some vocal social media users argued that his presence robbed the Japanese audiences of better representation in a game that was perfectly suited for it. Meanwhile, others have taken issue with his depiction as a warrior, pointing out that the rank of samurai that he held was not solely bestowed upon soldiers in premodern Japan.

  Ubisoft Responds to Assassin's Creed Shadows Yasuke Criticism
 </h2>
 <p>
  A July 23 statement from Ubisoft saw the company respond to some of that backlash coming from its Japanese fans. Among other things, the developer defended the inclusion of Yasuke by labeling him as "an ideal candidate" for telling the story of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . It said that while the real-life Yasuke's role at lord Oda Nobunaga's court was indeed a matter of debate, it chose to depict him as a traditional samurai warrior for the purposes of telling a compelling narrative. On the subject of Japanese representation, Ubisoft insisted that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is not lacking in it, not least because Japanese shinobi Naoe is "equally important" to its story.

 <p>
  The statement also saw the company apologize to the Japanese community over some of the game's promotional materials. While this sentiment wasn't expanded upon, it was likely referring to the fact that some previously shared
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  concept art featured a banner of a Japanese reenactment group. Ubisoft Japan had already apologized for this mistake back in mid-July 2024.

  Assassin's Creed Games Have Always Been Historical Fiction, Ubisoft Says

 <p>
  Regarding general authenticity complaints, Ubisoft noted that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games were never intended to be "factual representations of history," but merely historical fiction.
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  is no different, as it was primarily designed to be a compelling and entertaining experience, the company said.

 <p>
  Even so, Ubisoft confirmed that the creative liberties it has taken with the upcoming game have all been informed by its extensive collaboration with historians, researchers, and other consultants. But the company is taking full responsibility for all of its creative choices, having hence pleaded with fans not to direct their
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  criticism at its collaborators.

  It can be difficult to get started in the popular and highly-modable
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  , especially if this is your first in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series. There are a lot of stats to choose from, including Strength, Luck, Perception, and more. These traits will affect how your character performs at the beginning of the game, but you will be able to expand on them further as you progress.

  At the beginning, you'll have more than 30 points to allocate between all seven stats. You'll want to consider these points deeply, especially if you have a particular fighting style that you prefer. Here are some of the best ways to allocate your stats at the beginning of this beloved open-world game.

   With so many variations in Fallout: New Vegas' SPECIAL stats, Traits, and Skills, there is a wide variety of builds players can create at the beginning of the game. To add more variety to the available options for starting players and the best stats to choose from, we have added an additional build for Tanks. This allows players to have a more defense-focused option when choosing their starting stats, as well as the ability to properly use hefty guns like mini-guns. You will find information on how to create this character build here.

 <p>
  For starting skills, you'll want to choose
  <strong>
   Melee Weapons, Medicine (or Survival), and Science (or Lockpick)
  </strong>
  . Since you won't be focusing on guns much, you'll be better off choosing the Melee Weapons skill to enhance your abilities when using these types of weapons. Medicine or Survival is crucial for melee builds because you will probably be receiving the most damage from enemies out of the three builds due to the proximity of melee weapons. Science or Lockpick is necessary as well since you'll need to be able to get through locked areas.

  As for the two best traits to choose, you'll want
  <strong>
   Built to Destroy and Kamikaze
  </strong>
  . Built to Destroy will give you a higher chance of getting Critical Hits, while Kamikaze will boost your Action Points significantly, which can be incredibly helpful in V.A.T.S. If you don't plan on focusing on V.A.T.S., just take Built to Destroy.

  As for the best starting skills for a sniper build, you'll want to choose
  <strong>
   Sneak, Guns, and Science (or Lockpick)

  . These skills will allow you to remain undetected as a Sniper, while also making sure that your weapons take out enemies from afar in just a few hits. Science or Lockpick will be important for you as you reach new areas. You won't be able to get very far if you don't have one of these two unlocked.

  will be your typical all-rounder. You'll focus more on using medium-range weapons like an Assault Rifle. If you prefer to take your enemies head-on but don't want to get too close, like with melee weapons, this is a good option for you. Here's how to allocate your stat points.

  For the starting skills for a Gunner build, you'll want to choose
  <strong>
   Guns, Repair, and Lockpick (or Science)
  </strong>

 <p>
  As you choose your starting Skills for the Tank build, the best options here are
  <strong>
   Guns, Explosives, and Repair
  </strong>
  . If you'd rather use weapons like Gatling Lasers, you can swap Guns for Energy Weapons. This option and Explosives are a necessity for Tanks to take out enemies in only a few hits.

 <p>
  For the two traits that you can pick at the start, we recommend taking
  <strong>
   Fast Shot and Loose Cannon
  </strong>
  . Loose Cannon will be especially useful since you will have the ability as a Tank to get up close to enemies, and you will be able to throw your grenades much faster. Fast Shot will also increase the speed of your Guns and Energy Weapons, though you will be less accurate.

  It has been months since rumors that

  started going around the community. When update v30.30 dropped on July 23, it finally set things in motion with the addition of

  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  had been connected for a while now, and it was only a matter of time until
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  , one of the most known games published by Epic Games, made it into the Battle Royale as well. This guide will tell players what they need to know about the introduction of
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  so they can start preparing for its full launch.

  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  is now in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , but gamers still aren't able to fully access it. Once
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  officially becomes available in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , gamers will play an introductory tutorial mission so they can get accustomed to its mechanics. Nevertheless, fans can dip their toes into this experience before its launch, as
  <strong>
   it's already possible to create
   <em>
    Fall Guys
   </em>
   Creative Islands in
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

  in

  before it launches by making their own Creative maps using the recently added
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  sample. This is so
  <strong>
   Island Creators can start preparing their islands for the
   <em>
    Fall Guys
   </em>
   game full launch in
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   , which is expected to become available on August 6

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   You will be able to publish your Fall Guys islands starting August 6 via the Creator Portal — these islands won’t auto-publish so you’ll need to do it manually. Islands created with the Fall Guys template may qualify for placement in a limited time "Fall Guys" row in Discover.

  <em>
   Fall Guys

  tools are now available in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Creative and UEFN. This means that, even if players don't have any intentions of publishing a
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  island, they can start trying out the upcoming game using these tools.

 <p>
  To create a
  <em>
   Fall Guys

  island in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , start a new project in UEFN or
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Creative and choose a
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  starter template. There are various assets at players' disposal so they can start testing the waters and see how it feels to play
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .

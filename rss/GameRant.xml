  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed the rework of the Harlequin Crest, aka Shako, which will be available to players in Season 5.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's itemization will undergo significant changes in the upcoming season, promising to shake up the player experience significantly.

 <p>
  Of all the item rarities available in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , Uniques are the most coveted by players. While there are items specific to each class, there are Unique items that all
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players can equip. One of these items that is especially popular with
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players is the Harlequin Crest. This helmet can be dropped from monsters and chests in Wold Tiers 3 and 4, Nightmare Dungeons, Gathering Legions, or defeating bosses such as Duriel, King of Maggots, and Echo of Andariel. With the current
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  season drawing ever closer, Blizzard has revealed what will become of this fan-favorite item.

 <p>
  Wowhead has released the first look at the Harlequin Crest rework, revealing the item's new attributes. The popular
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  helmet has received several changes and with the start of Season 5, it will grant 1,850 maximum life, as well as an extra 18 maximum resources, 2,500 armor, and 20% base cooldown reduction. Another detail of the Shako rework that has caught the attention of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players is the removal of the level requirement to use the item.

  With the Harlequin Crest rework, the item will now have almost triple the cooldown reduction of its current iteration, which is 7%. If combined with the improvements to

In addition to the 7% cooldown, the latest version of Shako grants 1,528 maximum life, 12% resource generation, and an additional 28 to all stats. The only Shako attributes that haven't changed are the 20% damage and 4 additional ranks, the 1,156 armor, and the 925 power.

  The Armor Sets in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Remnant 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  are all incredibly varied both visually and in their stats. This has a lot to do with the fact that the player is traveling to all sorts of different worlds in this game, and as such Armor Sets will have different appearances based on their environment and different Resistances as well.

 <p>
  Though, to be fair, Armor Sets are a lot simpler in this sequel than they were in the last game,
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes,
  </em>
  as players don't need to upgrade their Armor using Upgrade Materials anymore. Also, this core change seemed to steam a lot from the idea of Set Bonuses being a little 'too' incentivized in
  <em>
   R: FtA
  </em>
  , but there's still a lot of merit to min-maxing which pieces to wear in a mixed Armor Set combination. Players heavily underestimate just how much each point of Armor or Resistance impacts survivability in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , so let's go over which Body pieces specifically are the best.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated July 30th, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
   </strong>
   Both the Awakened King DLC and the Forgotten Kingdom DLC for Remnant 2 have added their fair share of new Armor Sets to the game. Remnant 2 as a whole has a very diverse spread of different Armor Sets both in terms of stats and in terms of visuals. There are Armor Sets that give off an incredible sci-fi vibe, well-designed fantasy sets, believable post-apocalyptic sets, and much more. However, when it comes to their stats, the chest pieces are always going to make the biggest impact. These are typically the heaviest parts of each set that provide the most Armor and Resistance. So, with that in mind, let's take an in-depth look at all the Armor Sets in Remnant 2 currently while we wait for the new Armor Sets that are assuredly coming alongside the Dark Horizon third DLC for the game.

  The Battle Suit is one of the few new Armor Sets added in the Forgotten Kingdom DLC for
  <em>
   Remnant 2.
  </em>
  It's funny, despite this being a DLC set in Yaesha, a world with a unique race of creatures called Pan with their own culture and influences, one of the primary Armor Sets in this DLC is a military uniform from Earth.

 <p>
  On aesthetics alone, this Armor Set is great since the player ends up looking like a private in the military lost in another world (which isn't too far from the truth) but it's also just a pretty useful set in terms of stats. It's a Light Set, but even so, it provides a good amount of defense for the weight, and its Resistances are pretty evenly split as well, outside of Shock. And, as a final little bonus, this is also one of the few chest piece armor pieces where, when equipped, it won't matter what gloves the player equips, it won't change the appearance of the player's hands at all.

  The Disciple Set is essentially the 'poster' Armor Set for the Forgotten Kingdom DLC. If Armor Sets like the Dendroid Set represent the Invader and the Bruiser Set represents the Challenger, then the Disciple Set absolutely represents the Invoker Archetype. And, upon reading the in-game description of the separate pieces of this Armor Set, it becomes clear why this is so innately tied to the Invoker. The Disciple Set not only tells the history of Lydusa and Meidra, the helmet even recreates her visage.

 <p>
  However, as an Armor Set, it's also pretty great. It's a Heavy Armor Set, and the Mantle is the heaviest part of it, but the Armor it gives absolutely makes up for the amount of weight in applies to the wearer. The only downsides of this set are the fact that its Resistances aren't the most spread out and that it's a bit difficult to match it visually with other sets, but other than that the Disciple Set is amazing.

  First up is an Armor Set that only the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition holders of
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  will get to use for their first playthrough, the Raiment of the Elder Set. The Elder Set, Void Set, and Radiant Set were all very popular Armor Sets in
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  , so the developers at Gunfire Games brought them back as Edition bonuses for the second game.

 <p>
  Thankfully, there is still a way for anyone to obtain them in-game, regardless of edition, and that's buying any of these three Sets from Whispers after completing the main campaign. In regards to the Raiment's stats, the Elder Raiment is actually one of the lighter armor pieces in the game, weighing in at only 9 Units. This alone makes it a worthwhile armor piece to use for anyone who doesn't want to invest in Strong Back but also wants their dream combination of armor pieces.

 <p>
  Jumping up a whole 30.4 points of Armor from the Elder Raiment (and 14.4 units of weight), the Fae Royal Bodyplate is a great defensive option for anyone who is looking for something that prioritizes Armor over Resitances. And, at 26.4 Weight, it's typically 'just' barely light enough for players to still wear a mixed Armor Set that includes this Bodyplate and still stay in the Medium Weight Class range.

 <p>
  Visually, the whole Fae Royal Set is one of the best looking in the game, which is proven by the fact that Gunfire Games basically made another copy of this Armor Set for the Awakened King DLC.

  While it's great that Gunfire Games listened to their community (as they often do) and made it possible to obtain the Red Prince's whole Set in the Awakened King DLC instead of just the Crown, the Armor itself (outside of the helmet) is basically just a recolor.

 <p>
  The Crimson Guard Set and the Fae Royal Set are almost 1:1, outside of the main color choices of course. Still, mechanically, the Crimson Guard Plate isn't the exact same as the Fae Royal Bodyplate, it's a bit heavier with a bit more Armor. But with the changes to Weight Class and Stamina Cost penalty, a bit of extra weight has even less impact than it did before, making this Crimson Guard Set an easy recommendation.

 <p>
  The Realmwalker Set, as a whole, is deceptively 'hefty' in terms of the Armor it offers. It may just look like a military-style green jumpsuit, but there's a reason Founder Ford always wore one of these things. The Tunic, in particular, is an example of something that trades a bit of Armor for more of an even spread of Resistances, as it technically has less Armor than the Elder Rainment, but keeps players protected from the elements more often in exchange.

  The Space Worker Set is another option, alongside the Elder Rainent, that players tend to use the most to get themselves into a specific Weight Class without having to give up all that much. This Set might as well be a space-themed body suit, as it offers about as much 'Armor' compared to the Medium to Heavy Body Armor in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  as one would expect from a body suit, and it's also just as skin-tight.

 <p>
  That said, it's only a 'little worse' than the next Body Armor ranking on here, and the Shock Resist it gives can be helpful on N'Erud specifically or against very specific boss/enemy types.

 <p>
  As one would expect, as readers get higher and higher in these rankings, they'll notice that each subsequent Armor piece is just a pinch better than the one before it. While this might seem obvious, a lot of rankings tend to have a much larger amount of numerical differences between every entry. In any case, while it might seem like the jump up in both Weight and Armor from the Space Worker's Body is large, both Body Pieces have about a 2.5 Ratio for the amount of Armor they provide in relation to their Weight.

 <p>
  But the factor that really separates the High Noon Duds from all the others is how it seems to blend well visually with almost any combination of random armor pieces.

 <p>
  Despite the look of the Zealot Set, this isn't Light Armor. No, the Zealot Set is actually Medium Armor, similar to the Academic Set, which is also found in Losomn. Ignoring the Awakened King-specific benefits of wearing this full Set, the Zealot Overcoat in particular just has a good Armor to Weight Ratio.

 <p>
  And on top of that, it has some great Resistances outside of its Toxin Resist. Of course, this makes sense, given that this Set is tied to the Ritualist Archetype, a Class (or Dual-Class, depending on the combination) entirely built around Elemental Damage and Status Effects.

 <p>
  Not a ton of players have pointed this out, as they tend to keep the Labyrinth Mantle equipped alongside the rest of the Labyrinth Set, but when the Mantle is equipped alongside some basic pants (like the Survivor, Trainer, or Cultist Leggings), this chestpiece looks a lot like V's Cyberpunk Jacket from all the
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  promotional material. Well, maybe it's just the fact that both V's jacket and the Labyrinth Mantle have these comically large popped collars with that over-the-top LED light strip hooked up inside.

  Getting back on topic, the Archon's default Body Armor, the Labyrinth Mantle, is pretty comparable to the rest of the Medium Set category's Body Armor. For example, hopping from the Zealot Overcoat to this, players only get about 4.8 more Armor at the cost of 2.8 more units of Weight. Additionally, this Mantle gives some pretty stellar Resistances to Fire and Shock damage in particular, which seem to be the elements that pop up the most in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  overall, though Toxin damage does show up a decent amount in the new Losomn areas of the Awakened King DLC.

 <p>
  While it may seem a bit unfair, the only reason the Radiant Protector made it to the second place spot, besides its stellar stats overall, is simply because it's available to Deluxe and Ultimate Edition players right away. Having a Heavy Armor chest piece that offers an absurd 69 Armor and good Resistance in the first couple of areas of the game (where the World Level is, at most, generated at 1-3) makes it very hard for the player to get killed at all.

 <p>
  Later on in the game, there are better options besides the Radiant Set, of course. But, in the early game of
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , this Armor Set is honestly overpowered.

  And of course, as anyone who has routinely seen players wearing these sets in multiplayer would expect, the Leto MK I and Leto MK II Armor are ranked number 1. While this may seem ridiculous, given that wearing either of these Armor Sets in full causes the players to heavy flop as their evade option due to being 'Ultra Heavy', it's actually incredibly easy to get around that.

 <p>
  Granted, due to the changes the developers made to a lot of the Armor and Weight systems in
  <em>
   Remnant 2,
  </em>
  it might have seemed like the Leto Armor Sets would finally get knocked down a peg or two. And to be fair, they did, just not as much as people probably expected. These two Sets aren't nearly as good as they were before the changes, thankfully, but they are still the overall best options for pure Defense on any of

  Over the years, games have evolved a lot in terms of graphics and storytelling. While many feel nostalgic, overall the new influx of games on the market is becoming more rich and diverse, with even more fascinating premises and options to entertain players with. One major development, in particular, has been inclusive romance in major games. While there are tons and tons of visual novels and indie games that truly celebrate gender-inclusive romance, even some major gaming titles have paved the way for complete freedom of choice and expression for players.

 <p>
  Given how important it has become to make games as inclusive as possible, it's easy to see why players are actively seeking out games that let them experience a diverse range of romances. Fans are glad to see that the majority of video
  <strong>
   games with romance options
  </strong>
  have received the memo and are trying to make the romances in these titles as inclusive as possible, which is a source of great happiness for players with varying sexual orientations who want these video games to cater to their interests too.

   </strong>
   It's important for modern
   <strong>
    games with romance options
   </strong>
   to be as inclusive as possible to cater to players with varying genders and orientations. Male-female romances used to be the norm in gaming for the longest time, but this narrow view of relationships has changed as gaming has evolved over time. It's become clear that romances should cater to numerous factors instead of just sticking to this binary lens, and a lot of amazing video games have done a great job of ensuring that players can enjoy the romance they want without being restricted by their character's gender.

  The focus on RPG mechanics and a massive open world elicited a ton of mixed reactions from the fans of the series. While they were glad to see the series try something new, the addition of massive sandboxes felt forced and led to many players feeling like the games were unnecessarily bloated.
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  faced the same issues, but the game's strong story and memorable characters helped it stand out in the eyes of many.

 <p>
  It's one of the better
  <strong>
   games with romance options
  </strong>
  for players who want to enjoy more inclusive trysts. None of the romances are restricted to a player's gender, and the fact that people can change if Eivor is a male or female at any point during their playthrough adds to the freedom that this game lets players enjoy.

  The
  <em>
   Life is Strange
  </em>
  series is the poster child for how games should tackle inclusivity in video games. Every game in the series lets players interact with a wealth of unique and diverse characters who are a joy to interact with.
  <em>
   True Colors
  </em>
  is no exception here, and this
  <strong>
   game with romance options
  </strong>
  lets Alex romance either Steph or Ryan.

 <p>
  The latter is generally shunned by players for narrative reasons, making Steph the best romance option for these players who want Alex to end up with a person who genuinely supports her. It's a wholesome romance that helps the events of
  <em>
   True Colors
  </em>
  feel more iconic, making it another entry in an adventure series players love.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  is a game that players love despite the same accusations of a bloated open world that were faced by
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Players who manage to look past this issue will enjoy a strong action RPG with fun combat, memorable characters, and a wealth of engaging missions that will carry the experience and then some.

 <p>
  It's also an excellent video
  <strong>
   game with romance options
  </strong>
  that players will love to explore, even if players can't change their gender midway through the title like they could in
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Still, there are numerous romances in the game that people can engage with, even if none of these romances are all that serious or play a serious role in the narrative.

  Most people would agree that
  <em>
   Telltale's The Walking Dead
  </em>
  experienced a major high that later seasons have been chasing ever since. The two games that followed this emotional story felt lacking in some ways, with the absence of a proper hub and truncated gameplay elements making these titles feel inferior to the title which made players fall in love with Lee and Clementine's story.

 <p>
  So, fans were glad to see the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Season
   </em>
  </strong>
  take things in a bold direction, giving more structure to a series that had lacked the same ever since. Players love how AJ and Clementine elicit a lot of what made Lee's bond with the protagonist so magical while also retaining an original flair because of the child's lack of knowledge when it comes to a world before the apocalypse. Clementine herself gets a lot of time to shine, with both Violet and Louis being interesting characters that can potentially transform into romances if the player wishes.

  With the release of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  TV series, fans are currently enjoying what many people consider one of the greatest video game adaptations of all time — a statement that is not to be taken lightly given the success of modern shows like
  <em>
   Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  . There's no denying that this show's excellence is bound to compel fans to check out the series for themselves, with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  being a great point to jump in.

  The game may require a bit of modding to be as enjoyable as possible in modern times, but this effort is worthwhile. After all, players will get to enjoy one of the wackiest and most entertaining RPGs set in this universe that serves as a perfect amalgamation of modern and retro
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  . Even the "romances" in this game are in the spirit of the series, functioning more like hookups with viable partners regardless of the player's gender.

  It's odd to see the developer behind
  <em>
   Furi
  </em>
  working on a title like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Haven

  </strong>
  , which is more laid-back and story-driven than what The Game Bakers became famous for.
  <em>
   Haven

  's passionate tale is one of romance and acceptance, so it was rather ironic that the game only featured a traditional romance back when it launched.

  Thankfully, a later update added a much-needed feature where players choose the genders of the two people involved in this romance at the start. This promotion of inclusivity helped the game resonate more with the masses and was a positive change in every way that fans appreciated.

  's unique combination of dating sim gameplay and dungeon crawling may falter on the latter front, but the game's inclusive romances should be praised for what they strive to achieve. Characters are a joy to interact with, with these personalities being the best part of the experience.

  The new
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games may be pretty engaging in their own right, but there's no denying that their portrayal of same-sex relationships has been quite lacking and stereotypical. It's a shame since the writing present in these games is incredible, and allowing players to romance people of the same gender should've been included in the games at this point.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":925} -->

 <p>
  So, it's rather surprising to see that
  <em>
   Persona 2: Innocent Sin
  </em>
  features a very well-written and nuanced gay romance that the protagonist, Tatsuya, can engage in with their childhood friend, Jun. It's an excellent romantic angle that has been treated with great care, and it's a shame that later
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games turned gay characters into tropes for players to laugh at, which is extremely problematic indeed.

  The fact that
  <em>
   Tell Me Why
  </em>
  is the first game to feature a trans person in a lead role is a great piece of news that goes to show how far representation has come in video games. However, this also comes with a huge asterisk, especially since many people are disappointed that it took so long for a trans person to finally be included in a game in a lead role.

  Hopefully, more games will take a page out of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tell Me Why
   </em>
  </strong>
  and be more inclusive when it comes to the characters in their video games. Throughout this game's narrative, Tyler (the protagonist) can share an intimate moment with his twin sister's friend, Michael. It's a fun relationship that players can see blossom throughout the game's three episodes through playful flirting until it evolves into something special, if the player wishes, that is.

  A romantic visual novel game where players attend a monster high school and try to woo one of six romanceable characters,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Prom
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game with excellent writing that fans of the genre should check out. The fact that the majority of its romances are quite inclusive deserves due praise too.

 <p>
  The best part about
  <em>
   Monster Prom
  </em>
  is that it can be played as a competitive multiplayer game, which is extremely unique and totally unlike most other visual novel titles in the same vein. The game's excellent writing will keep players engaged till the very end, which is a testament to just how underrated this game is.

    Dragon's Dogma

  is a unique action RPG set in an open world with some amazing combat. Over the years, Capcom has nailed the combat of almost all of its games, and

  The fight against the Dragon who stole the player's heart starts with their loved one being captured by said Dragon. This lover can be of any gender, which is pretty great despite the lackadaisical romance mechanics in the game.

  is another gem from Rockstar Studios that is a pretty great game in its own right.

  In

  CRPGs are known for having great character stories and relationships, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pathfinder: Kingmaker
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no exception to this golden rule. This game has several characters with different sexual orientations that players can interact romantically with.

  The diversity of the romances in this game will please the majority of people who play this stellar title. It's great that indie gaming has allowed the CRPG genre to stay relevant since it does feature some great narrative experiences.

  might not be the most serious game out there, but it does get a few things right that most triple-A games can only hope to get right these days. Volition's action-packed franchise's fourth installment gives the player a ton of freedom to romance any of the nine characters introduced.

  This is also regardless of gender, and while the game doesn't take itself too seriously, it's a nice breath of fresh air and makes for some pretty hilarious and iconic dialogue between the characters involved.

  While many would consider the original
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  to be outdated,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fable 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  still holds decently to today's graphical and gameplay standards.
  <em>
   Fable 2
  </em>
  is one of those medieval fantasy games that goes surprisingly deep into romance and marriage.

 <p>
  The good thing is that a large number of characters from almost anyone can be romanced and married depending on their gender preferences. The downside is that some romance options can't be executed "safely," which seems incredibly counterproductive to such an otherwise inclusive and freedom-embracing game. However, for the sheer number of choices alone, it's a good game to check out.

  Japanese RPG games are generally well-known for their abundance of romance options, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem: Three Houses
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no different in that regard. There's a whole myriad of characters who can all be romanced, regardless of which gender the player chooses for their character Byleth at the beginning of the game.

 <p>
  The romance options are based on the house the player joins, and while there are more straight options, there are still far more inclusive same-gender options in the game compared to a myriad of other adventure RPG games on the market.

 <p>
  Even significantly older games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars: The Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  showed signs of modest progress. While the base game itself only had opposite-gender romances, DLCs added options for same-gender and all-gender romances, which significantly improved the romance experience overall.

  Depending on who the player picks as their companion, they can unlock more of their storyline and eventually romance and marry them. Some characters can be picked by both genders, and the faction of the player plays a part in the choice as well.

 <p>
  While six isn't much to choose from, it's still nice to know these options aren't limited to gender. A system of approval and disapproval will instead determine whether companions will fall in love with the player's character. The romance scenes might be cheesy, but anyone who's a sucker for it will appreciate it.

  The
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series is an epic, high-fantasy video game franchise, so, of course, it’s full of fantastical places to explore, including a range of castles, fortresses, and towers. Some of the castles in question are rich with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age
   </em>
  </strong>
  lore, though some are only talked about or mentioned in codexes. Most of the well-known castles can be explored or visited in at least one of the three
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  We’re going to be looking at a few particularly noteworthy castles in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series, but we’re being a bit lenient with our definition of castle. If it’s a large, impressive building used as an estate, or as housing for any kind of forces, it qualifies for this topic.

  Vigil’s Keep is well known for previously being home to the Howe family in Ferelden, but it is transformed into a base of operations for the rebuilding Grey Warden organization by the time the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins DLC - Awakening
  </em>
  - rolls around.

 <p>
  Vigil’s Keep is not only a notable castle in the lore of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series, but its fate can also change depending on player choices. When playing the DLC, there is the option to build the defenses of the Keep by completing certain quests. If this isn’t done, and players don’t opt to go to the Keep during the final battle, then the Keep can fall.

  Next is a snow-covered castle that also appears in the
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  DLC for
  <em>

  . If players decide to travel to Soldier’s Peak, they’ll find a demon-infested Keep and a sad ending for the Grey Wardens that were once housed there.

  Much like Vigil’s Keep, Soldier’s Peak is a castle that can have a different story depending on the player. If players choose to go to the castle and face the demons inside, it is possible to begin restoring Soldier’s Peak to its former glory.

  Griffon Wing Keep is a little smaller than some of the other castles previously mentioned, but it is still one of the more noteworthy ones found in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  universe thanks to its unique location.

 <p>
  Most of the notable castles are found in Ferelden, especially in the north where the weather is colder and snowy. However, Griffon Wing Keep is in Orlais, found in the desert like Western Approach. In
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  , players can capture the Keep by defeating the Venatori within and start rebuilding it to make it worthy of its former Grey Warden inhabitants.

  Weisshaupt is the only castle here that hasn’t made a physical appearance in any of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games yet, but there is a good chance it could appear in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard

  <em>

  </em>
  world.

 <p>
  Weisshaupt is a desert fortress within the Broken Tooth butte in the Anderfels, and it is an important location as it is the main headquarters of the Grey Wardens. Because of this, it is mentioned often throughout the series. It is even briefly seen in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , albeit in an illusion when the Warden goes into the Fade. Images of Weisshaupt can be seen in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Volume 1
  </em>
  guidebook, but if players do finally get a chance to see it in
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  , it’s sure to be an impressive structure.

  Castle Cousland might seem like a regular estate in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  world, but it has significant importance to the narrative for those who choose the Human Noble Origin story in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  . The castle is the home of the Cousland family, who have been Teyrns in Highever, a northern coastal area of Ferelden, for generations. As well as having this connection to the Highever nobility, Castle Cousland can also be explored by Human Nobles in
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Players also have a chance to become part of the Cousland family, if only briefly, before tragedy strikes. It's hard not to form a connection to the castle and its inhabitants when playing through the Human Noble
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  route, making Castle Cousland a highly memorable location.

  This entry might be a little bit of a cheat as the Circle Tower is quite obviously a tower rather than a castle. However, the Circle acts in the same way as the other fortress castles that have been discussed. It houses important forces, the mages and the Templars guarding them, and has an important role to play, so it should be mentioned.

  The Circle Tower in Ferelden is one of many Circle Towers spread across Thedas, designed to be a safe yet restrictive place for mages to learn how to harness their magic abilities while being watched over by Templar guardians. The Circle Tower is in a state of disarray when the Warden visits in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  due to a demonic takeover, which would go on to become a historical event in
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  lore. Its iconic design and importance to the lore of the world make The Circle Tower an impressive and memorable Dragon Age castle (despite not really being a castle in the traditional sense).

  Much like The Circle, Redcliffe Castle is home to an important plot thread in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  . It also makes a return in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  , though players only get to go back into the castle if they opt to recruit the mages rather than the Templars.

 <p>
  The castle is a historical building in
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  lore, having stood for generations upon generations. It is also noted by Cullen to be one of the most defensible castles in Ferelden, with multiple assaults on the castle throughout history being thwarted. The castle can be thoroughly explored in
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  , and when players do so, it becomes clear that Redcliffe Castle stood the test of time for good reason.

  Skyhold quickly became the most iconic castle in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  world after it was discovered during the events of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . Nestled in the snowy Frostback Mountains and conveniently located between Ferelden and Orlais, Solas guides the way to the long-abandoned Skyhold castle when the Inquisition's base of operations, Haven, is destroyed. The player then begins to rebuild the castle as it becomes a pilgrimage of sorts for travelers across Thedas.

 <p>
  Skyhold is a sprawling beauty of a castle, even in its initially dilapidated state, and the importance it played in the formation, and eventual victory, of the Inquisition can’t be understated. Players can roam the castle and explore every nook and cranny too, which is always a nice touch. The importance that the fortress plays in the narrative of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  and the legacy it would go on to create makes Skyhold the best and most noteworthy caste in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared their handmade tufted twin Umbreon rug. The adorable
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  rug features two Umbreon, one shiny and one standard, and would likely delight any fans of the particular Eeveelution.

  While Eevee hasn't received a new evolutionary form for a while, Umbreon was one of the first to join the list following Eevee's original three evolutions, Jolteon, Flareon, and Vaporeon. Umbreon was also one of the Pokemon who helped to introduce new concepts to the series, like getting a high friendship level with a Pokemon in order to achieve a certain type of evolution. This has contributed to Umbreon being particularly memorable among a popular group of Eeveelutions.

  fan Zaldraz has shared an image of the tufted rug they made of an Umbreon and a Shiny Umbreon. The two Umbreon look like they're touching noses with each other, appearing largely identical aside from the Shiny version's unique coloring. The shading in particular is quite remarkable to look at, with the body of each Umbreon looking like it has actual depth and three-dimensionality despite being a largely flat rug.

  This isn't the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan's first effort in making a tufted rug based on a game property. They've made a lot of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  rugs previously, showcasing some on their Reddit account and selling others in their Etsy shop. Although it might come as a surprise to some,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  rugs have become a fairly popular form of fanart in recent times. They tend to be charming, but also serve as a functional bit of decoration for a player's home. Chances are most people wouldn't want to step on a rug that's this cute, but its soft and fuzzy quality would at least be nice to touch.

  As it turns out, this isn't the first time that someone has looked to Umbreon for inspiration when making a rug, either. Another artist shared a unique
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  rug design that featured a Poke Ball that can split open, revealing an Umbreon inside. While Zaldraz's version is a bit more straightforward, both designs are adorable tributes to the unique Dark-type Pokemon.

  For now, it remains to be seen if a new Eeveelution will join the family tree anytime soon.

  could introduce all kinds of new Pokemon types and evolutions, so there's a chance that Eevee may get a bit of time in the spotlight once again. With so many creatures, it's hard for all of them to get the attention they deserve. It's clear that Eevee remains popular, but some worry that Eevee might not ever get a new evolution.

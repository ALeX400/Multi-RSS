  There are a lot of
  <strong>
   horror titles available on the PS2
  </strong>
  , and players can expect anything when it comes to these titles. Some are popular stalwarts of the horror gaming universe, while others have slipped under the radar of many fans of spooky games. The monsters are grotesque, the combat is stressful (if available at all), and the scares are constant in these haunted classics.

   Though gaming has evolved several generations ahead, the PS2 is still a largely celebrated console that was home to some of the greatest hits of all time, especially in the horror category. Franchises such as Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Siren have all released multiple titles for this console, as well as more one-off unique titles that are some of the
   <strong>
    best PS2 horror games
   </strong>
   . With so many successful years on the market, there are countless fantastic
   <strong>
    PS2 horror games
   </strong>
   available, and this article has been updated to include even more scarily good titles, and a more accurate ordering of these titles.

  The AI in question, called Dorothy, was destroyed in the events of the first game, but players must still contend with her creations, the Galerians. The main character called Rion is called upon one last time to defeat the remaining Galerians. Though it received middling reviews, fans of anime and early
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games will enjoy the themes explored and the gameplay on offer, even if it won't scare them as witless as other horror experiences available for PS2 players.

  Set in a remote base in Antarctica, players assume the role of marine Sergeant Dennis Riley who is sent to investigate a distress call, and finds extremely distressing events have unfolded within. There are more monsters than people within its confines, and the game places a large emphasis on survival. Despite his combat training, Dennis will spend more time running for his life than fighting, which only makes the threats he encounters all the more terrifying.

  This game would have flown under the radar of many gamers, though those that did give it a try would have found a diamond in the rough. Though it was a gem that could have used some polishing,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Curse: The Eyes of Isis
   </strong>
  </em>
  did still offer some scares and fun to players.

 <p>
  Set in the year 1809, strange events have begun to occur in the British Museum after a gang of thugs stole one of the items on display, the Eye of Isis. A mysterious fog has rolled through the building, killing or transforming everything it touches. The game will take place for the most part in said museum, but
  <em>
   Curse
  </em>
  will also take players on trips to the coast and even the pyramids in Egypt.

  used to be a CGI anime in Japan, proving popular enough to warrant a horror PS2 game. The gameplay is rather simplistic, which sees players gathering the soul bottles in the possession of the guests, who will flee with the bottle if they are spotted. More bottles will increase the number of guests and rooms, as well as increasing the difficulty of sneaking up on guests.

  Another Capcom hidden gem,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Glass Rose
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a unique point-and-click psychological horror game. In it, reporter Takashi Kagetani explores an abandoned building with his friend before he is knocked out, and awakens seventy years in the past. To escape back to his own time, Takashi must explore every nook and cranny of the mansion, and speak to its inhabitants, unfurling the mysteries hidden beneath the tasteful furniture.

 <p>
  This unique time travel plot, the mind-reading abilities, and point-and-click gameplay set
  <em>
   Glass Rose
  </em>
  apart from the rest. While this risky innovation may not have always worked in the game's favor,
  <em>
   Glass Rose
  </em>
  promises a unique and fun horror experience for the PS2.

  <em>

  , a
  <strong>
   PS2 horror game,
  </strong>
  which would be a much different experience for Soulsborne players. It focuses more on horror and survival, telling a tale that ambitiously combines sci-fi and ghosts to create a wholly unique experience.

  Honeymooners Richard and Claudia embark on a shuttle to the Moon when supernatural forces cause engine failures within the shuttle as it comes to land, causing a deadly crash that kills many passengers who then become ghosts that flood the base. It's up to Richard to free the spirits that are now trapped in the base, without joining the legion of the dead himself.

  being such a success, garnering the praise of critics and gamers alike, a sequel was inevitable, and was just as shocking with its gratuitous violence. Parts of the game had to be censored for it to be released on consoles at the time, and once it was, it exceeded many people's expectations.

  Playing as the escaped patient of a mental facility, Daniel's amnesia slowly begins lifting once he returns to his ruined home. The other patient he is with, Leo, is the manifestation of another part of himself awakened by a research project to create the perfect assassin. The twist is just as surprising to the players as it is to Daniel, and the battle in his mind against himself is one to be remembered.

  Most fans know that game tie-ins based on movies and TV shows tend to be about as successful as movie adaptations of games — which is to say, not successful at all. But fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The X-Files

  </strong>
  may have been pleasantly surprised by this more than adequate

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resist or Serve

  aimed to deliver three 'lost episodes' into the timeline of the series, which all revolved around what the show is most known for: aliens. The writing and story delivered a frightening and solid experience, cementing itself as an excellent addition to the PS2's library of horrors.

  returns with its episodic style game, and survival horror elements as the characters must survive the dangerous inhabitants of the island. While it retains the aspects of the heart-racing gameplay of the original, it loses some of the difficult and trial-and-error gameplay that plagued the original game, creating an altogether more pleasant yet terrifying game.

  The game takes place on Yamijima Island, where the entire population vanished during a blackout in 1976. A journalist working on an article, a ferry containing a few other passengers, and a squad of soldiers all find their way to the island, where they are subjected to the dangers and horrors lurking there.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Thing

  is from the minds at Konami, and the game acts as a sequel to the cult classic horror film. The player controls Captain Blake, who is sent to investigate a strange facility where concerning events are taking place. This game can be fairly challenging, but there are many weapons available for Captain Blake to blast through Walkers and Scuttlers.

 <p>
  Captain Blake also relies on adrenaline injections to keep his mind from cracking at the horrific beasts he continuously comes into contact with. There's a lot of nightmare fuel in
  <em>
   The Thing
  </em>
  , so it comes highly recommended for players who love strange, grossly held-together creatures.

  Outside the main numbered entries in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  series, Capcom has delivered many fantastic spin-off titles that gave players unique games and experiences in the world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   <strong>
    Outbreak

  The game is set during the start of the virus outbreak in Raccoon City, and tells the tales of these characters as they try to make their escape before the situation spirals out of control. The game allows players to tailor their experience at the start of every episode. They can choose the difficulty level to make it harder or easier, depending on their personal experience. This makes
  <em>
   Outbreak
  </em>
  an impressively innovative title for its time.

  Horror fans all know about the infamous
  <em>
   <strong>
    Clock Tower
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, and the scary recurring villain, Scissorman, who is hellbent on chopping up his victims with the enormous set of scissors he wields. In the third game, the Scissorman is just one of the many terrifying villains players will have to face.

  Playing as the fifteen-year-old Alyssa Hamilton, a young girl with special abilities, players will travel through time to free the souls of those that have been killed, and defeat some monstrous villains along the way. The ambitious scope of this era-spanning storyline is truly impressive, especially considering the era in which it was released.

Each teenager has unique abilities to overcome the creatures. There is even a co-op system to allow players to share the experience.

   <strong>
    Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
   </strong>
  </em>
  is something of a remake of the very first game, returning players to the familiar story of Harry Mason searching for his missing daughter in the series' famous city, Silent Hill. However, this game retains a unique identity by reimagining small portions of the plot, gameplay, and characters. It expands upon the original with five new endings, and by adding a new gameplay element in the form of psychotherapy sessions.

  <em>
   Shattered Memories

  feeling distinct enough from the original while maintaining enough familiarity for fans of the original to experience on a more recent game console. While it won't be remembered as fondly as the main staples of the series, like the second installment, for example, it is still well worth every second of a horror fans' time.

  is another infamous PS2 game that was removed from the shelves in some countries due to how graphic the violent nature of its content was. Players control Cash, a death row inmate who was supposed to receive a lethal injection. Instead, he was only sedated, awakening to hear instructions from the mysterious Director, who promises him his freedom in exchange for him murdering the Hunters throughout Carcer City.

  Thus begins Cash's murderous journey through the crime-ridden fictional city. Almost everything found in the city can be used as a weapon, resulting in a variety of executions that can be hasty to gruesome, and which show over-the-top levels of gore. The faint of heart and weak of stomach should be wary if they decide they want to step into the streets of Carcer City themselves.

  Torque is a prisoner on death row for the murder of his family, though he has no memory of committing the crime. After an earthquake reveals the presence of a supernatural enemy, Torque must battle his inner demons and prove his own morality if he wants to escape death.

  Since the launch of its battle royale mode in 2017, it is fair to say that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  has changed the landscape of multiplayer gaming. By championing the seasonal battle pass system with a free-to-play framework, the popular title has completely changed how post-launch content is usually delivered throughout most major multiplayer gaming experiences.

 <p>
  Alongside its standard seasons,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has grown to include massive crossovers with other popular franchises, while still finding time to include curated content and limited-time modes based around real-world holidays like Christmas and Halloween. Of these holidays, Halloween is a particular point of excitement within
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , with the game having a long and fruitful history of memorable content associated with this spooky season. While the full details around this year's content have not been released, fans can already get a good idea of what to expect from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's Halloween plans in 2024.

  Dedicated events for Halloween have been a staple of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ever since it released, with the Fortnitemares event making consistent annual appearances since 2017. Many leaks and rumors already paint a good picture of what this year's Fortnitmares will entail, despite the event not being officially revealed by Epic Games yet as things stand. With
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's recent Doom Event ending on October 5, fans are now firmly looking towards the game's upcoming Halloween offerings, with Fortnitemares being estimated to launch between October 11 and 15.

  It seems that crossovers with some huge Halloween IPs are going to be a staple of this year's Fortnitemares event, with several skins already being teased in this regard. It is already confirmed that a Halloween-themed style for Marshmello's skin will soon come to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , as well as new skins depicting Leatherface from
  <em>
   The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  and Billy the Puppet from the
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  Leaks suggest that these skins will arrive alongside a Halloween-themed limited-time mode for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , which will introduce a brand-new Mythic item. This new Mythic item will allegedly be the Billy Boom Bike, inspired by the famous
  <em>

  puppet, which will hone in on enemies and explode at close proximity. Fans should also expect a variety of quests tied to this mode, bringing fresh rewards in the way of things like XP and spooky cosmetics.

  Of course, players should also expect the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  map to once again get a Halloween makeover this October, with the key art for 2024's Fortnitemares showing some popular POIs emblazoned with pumpkins and vines. Fortnitemares should also come with the usual in-game weapon, vehicle, and item changes, with things like the Pumpkin Launcher and Witches Broom being very likely to return.

 <p>
  This year's Fortnitemares event will also come with a range of fresh unique cosmetics, and players should expect new Halloween-styled skins, back blings, weapon camos, pickaxes, emotes, gliders, and more to soon hit the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  store. Alongside the confirmed crossover Halloween skins with
  <em>
   The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  , players should also expect some other licensed spooky skins to make appearances deeper into this year's Fortnitemares event. Leaks suggest that another round of
  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  skins will feature further along into the event, and even if this does not happen, the unrivaled crossover power of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  makes it likely for even more collaborations to come this Halloween. While more solid information is expected to be released over the coming week, it is already clear that fans have a lot of content to look forward to in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  this Halloween.

  Edgar, a streamer well-known for playing games ahead of their intended release, gets issued a message by Bandai Namco during a stream of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  community is extremely excited about this game, as it is the long-awaited fourth entry in the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series. While
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is set to launch worldwide on October 11, the game's Deluxe and Ultimate Editions give players access to it three days early. However, there are some gamers who are getting it even earlier than that.

 <p>
  Some gamers have posted about how they got their orders for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  early, with posts on social media that show off the Collector's Edition of the game, getting even earlier access than those who ordered the Deluxe and Ultimate editions. One particular streamer not only got early access to the game, but was also streaming the whole thing, which caught the attention of publisher Bandai Namco.

  The streamer who leaked the game went by "Edgar," though their account has already been terminated. Some fans first caught wind of this leaker's stream via Twitter account SLOplays, who warned fans about potential spoilers for
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  . The official Bandai Namco Twitter account responded to the tweet with a knowing eyes emote. Soon enough, any streamers leaking
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  got a message from Bandai Namco's official YouTube and Twitch accounts in their chat, simply telling them to stop streaming, with one message directly calling out the streamer, reading "Edgar my guy stop doing this."

  Videos of the game were up on Edgar's Twitch account, but have since been purged, though the "recent games" category on the platform notes that
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  was the only game that was played recently. For some fans who might be doubting the validity of Bandai Namco going around taking down these early streams, others have shown off different perspectives of the streams before they were taken down. Bandai Namco's own US brand manager, Ryan Wagner, also got in on the fun, posting a tweet that read "Hello "NotEdgar123_", accompanied by a clip of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  's Cooler beating up Goku from the titular villain's movie.

  The streams of these early
  <em>

  leaks reportedly didn't show much before they were taken down. While the single-player campaign has a bunch of familiar faces and is retelling the story that fans have already seen multiple times, the real meat of what fans want to be surprised about is
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's expansive "What If" scenarios. Despite the takedown, it appears that Edgar might be streaming under alternate accounts, and other leaked videos have been circulating too, so fans may want to err on the side of caution if they plan on going into

 <p>
  Users on
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  have suggested that video game developers that introduce changes to their end-user license agreements (EULAs) should offer refunds to players that do not wish to accept the new terms and conditions. Steam itself has a platform-wide EULA that has been updated repeatedly over the years, but every game that gets uploaded to and sold on the site is subject to a separate set of terms that fans may not always wish to see altered after purchase.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  End-user license agreements are often dozens of pages of legal text that many users do not read in their entirety, with a majority of players often scrolling through quickly and accepting the terms to immediately get into a game. While these agreements are generally harmless for the user, some players feel that modern changes to data collection and a need for online privacy can be at risk when certain entities make abrupt changes to their EULAs. As such, a number of users have started discussions about what should happen when video games on Steam make sudden updates to these agreements.

 <p>
  Reddit users have boldly suggested that players should be entitled to a refund if a game they play makes changes to its EULA. When purchasing or downloading a game, users are often presented with a Terms and Conditions page which contains the end-user license agreement for that title. When changes are made to the agreement, companies are legally obligated to notify users, though they are not always required to detail the specific adjustments made. As such, a multitude of Steam users have voiced a desire for mandated refund offers any time a game changes its EULA. Players agree to a certain set of terms when buying AAA and indie games on Steam, and, should those terms change, they may no longer wish to accept the EULA. As such, users suggest they should be entitled to a refund.

 <p>
  While many companies use a boilerplate legal outline for their licensing agreements, others may add in unexpected details, like the Easter egg in the
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  EULA. However, users fear more nefarious content can be easily snuck into agreements, especially in the form of post-purchase changes. Many countries around the world have data protection laws in place, but users feel Steam's parent company Valve should implement legal policies that ensure players do not feel financially obligated to accept altered terms and conditions to avoid throwing away money they invested in a game.

  Ensuring player safety in gaming can be a challenge, particularly in the realm of legal agreements. Laws are constantly evolving in an attempt to keep up with rapid technological change, and user feedback can be a great way to achieve positive progress. As it stands, EULA laws are controlled at the government level, though it will be interesting to see if Valve takes any action to implement user protections on
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  .

  <strong>
   Riot Games
  </strong>
  has debunked a recent rumor claiming that the studio was developing a competitor to Valve's upcoming hero shooter
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  . The dubious source of the rumor had already muddled its credibility, but Riot Games' definitive confirmation wholly discredits it.

 <p>
  Riot Games has two of the most popular competitive live-service titles under its belt -
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  . Both of these games see active player numbers in the millions on a daily basis, making them immensely successful ventures for Riot Games. Where
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  is a MOBA and
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  is a hero shooter, Valve's latest live-service game
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  merges these genres into a unique blend.
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is currently in an alpha test state, but still garners around 100,000 players every day.

 <p>
  Several game studios are likely taking note of
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  's unique qualities and novelties for their own projects, but a recent unfounded rumor flew a bit too close to the sun, alleging that Riot Games received a hefty $200 million investment from Tencent to develop a
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  competitor. The rumor's only accompanying source being a doctored PC Gamer article made it questionable from the onset, and now Riot Games communication manager Joe Hixson has completely shut it down in a recent tweet.

 <p>
  Hixson flat-out called the rumor "extra fake," aptly pointing out that the article it refers to doesn't exist and that Tencent doesn't fund Riot Games' development in such a capricious manner. To cap off his refutation, Hixson stated that "nothing like
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  " is currently being worked on at Riot Games' R&amp;D department. As far as confirmed projects go, Riot Games is developing two new projects set in the world of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  . The first is free-to-play fighting game
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  , which will launch in 2025, and the second project is an unannounced MMO that's a bit further out.

 <p>
  Riot Games likely has too much on its plate at the moment to be working on a big-budget
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  competitor, especially since the studio is also moving
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  to Unreal Engine 5. As mentioned previously, Riot Games already has a highly popular MOBA and hero shooter to its name, so it doesn't make sense that the studio would continue chasing success in these genres. If anything, Riot Games' in-development and canceled projects suggest that it really wants to capitalize on the fighting game genre.
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  seems to be faring well with players, so it might just turn out to be another Riot hit when it releases next year.

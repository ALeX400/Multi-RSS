  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Season 4 Reloaded: the Reclaimer 18 shotgun and the Sledgehammer melee weapon. Alongside these armaments, players can also expect new maps, modes, and mutation-themed content arriving in

 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  is a first-person shooter that follows Task Force 141 in their mission to stop the ultranationalist Makarov from starting World War 3. The game features a single-player campaign, a multiplayer mode with remastered maps from previous titles, and a Zombies mode. Despite the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  campaign facing criticism for its perceived brevity, the multiplayer remains a popular feature. Through the new content additions coming in Season 4 Reloaded, the game aims to enhance the multiplayer experience.

  The Reclaimer 18 shotgun introduced in the upcoming
  <em>
   Call of Duty: MW3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Season 4 Reloaded adds a versatile combat option for players, supporting both pump-action and semi-auto modes. The pump-action mode provides superior range, making it ideal for picking off enemies from a distance. Conversely, the semi-auto mode offers a rapid fire rate, perfect for close-quarters combat where speed is crucial. Players can further customize the Reclaimer 18 with various attachments, including incendiary Dragon’s Breath rounds or slug ammunition, alongside barrel modifications to enhance range, recoil control, or handling speed. This shotgun also brings new weapon camos, such as Bugged Out, He’s Looking At You, Azure Refract, and Donut Worry, which can be unlocked through specific in-game challenges.

  Moreover, alongside the

  Season 4 weapons, the Sledgehammer melee weapon promises to be a brutal addition to players' arsenals. Featuring a 20-pound carbon steel head, this melee option allows for devastating swings, overhead attacks, and pole butt strikes. It introduces the Dubs Dubs Dubs weapon camo, accessible by completing a dedicated challenge. This melee weapon is expected to add a new dynamic to close combat.

Havoc mode, inspired by classic arena shooters, features five match modifiers that activate progressively as teams reach specific elimination milestones, with 14 different modifiers available to keep gameplay fresh and unpredictable. The update also includes new maps, such as Incline, a mid-sized snow-covered map set in the mountains of Urzikstan.

  Combining these two ingredients creates this 2-star
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  dish, which the game describes as a perfect, fluffy, sweet banana muffin. It certainly sounds like the perfect treat without the need for sugar. Once cooked, you can eat a Sugar-Free Banana Muffin to restore
  <strong>
   +677 energy
  </strong>
  or sell it at Goofy's Stall for 39
  <strong>
   Gold Star Coins
  </strong>
  . Overall, this is a small profit compared to other
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  recipes. However, it makes a lot of sense, considering how straightforward the ingredients are to get.

  To get Bananas in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , pick them from Banana Trees growing in the
  <strong>
   Peaceful Meadow
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Dazzle Beach
  </strong>
  . Look for the short palm trees with orange leaves. Harvesting Bananas gives you three at a time, and the trees grow their classic fruit in only 23 minutes. If you've got a bigger bunch than you need, you can sell them at Goofy's stall for 29 Gold Star Coins or consume them to replenish a decent +350 energy.

   Goofy's Stall

  in the
  <strong>
   Peaceful Meadow
  </strong>
  for only one Gold Star Coin for a bag of Wheat Seeds. If you've upgraded this Stall, you can also buy fully-grown Wheat for 10 Gold Star Coins each. You only need to add one piece of Wheat to the cooking pot when making Sugar-Free Banana Muffin, so you'll probably have plenty of Wheat left over to create other culinary delights in the kitchen.

  A lucky
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has achieved the feat of hatching a shiny Larvesta with impressive IVs. One of the ways
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can get Pokemon in Niantic's game is by hatching eggs. The rotation of Pokemon obtainable from
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  eggs changes regularly, increasing trainers' chances to grow their collections with new monsters.

 <p>
  This month,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  held the Scorching Steps event, with players having the chance to hatch specific Pokemon from 2, 5, and 10 KM eggs. Something that caught the attention of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers was the appearance of Larvesta as one of the Pokemon that could be hatched, as the Pokemon with an extremely low chance of appearing in eggs. Getting a Larvesta is not an easy quest for
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players, but one trainer defied the odds and shared their incredible feat with the community.

 <p>
  In a display of great luck, Reddit user Rare-Bat787 hatched a shiny Larvesta that is almost a hundo, the most powerful variant of a Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . The screenshot shared by the Pokemon player shows their Larvesta which, in addition to being shiny, has three stars, maximum Attack and Defense IVs, and almost perfect Defense. In the comments, the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player reveals that they hatched the shiny Larvesta from a single 10-km egg they had in their inventory, which makes the feat even more impressive.

  introduced Larvesta and its evolution Volcarona last year at the "An Instinctive Hero" event. It didn't take long for Larvesta to gain a reputation as a rather difficult Pokemon to get, which has caused controversy among
  <em>

  </em>
  players on several occasions. By announcing the Scorching Steps event, as well as including Larvesta in egg-hatching encounters, for the first time, Niantic has made shiny Larvesta available in
  <em>

  </em>
  . Despite this, the devs didn't increase the hatching odds, making the encounter a matter of luck for trainers.

  As the fifth chapter in
  <em>
   The
  </em>
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  made leaps and bounds in simplifying old-school RPG elements into a more easily accessible final product. This was clearly the right move, given how popular the series has remained (and how often it's been ported). The exploration in this game is the beating heart of the series and one of the biggest reasons why players keep coming back. With the release of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , the entertainment factor of handcrafted Bethesda worlds is something fans are more aware of than ever before.

  One of the many things players will find during their journey in Skyrim to make things easier for themselves are Standing Stones. These unique structures provide numerous perks and benefits that make them worth seeking out. The Guardian Stones that players find early on during their journey in Skyrim do a great job of introducing these benefits before gamers find more varied

   : Standing Stones in Skyrim are great finds that players can use to gain passive bonuses, giving them something to rely on as they progress. This can be in the form of unique active skills that can be used to debilitate enemies, passive effects that help players out by either amplifying their skills or improving their growth, and everything else along the same lines. While every Standing Stone in Skyrim brings something unique to the table that players will love to mess around with, there's no denying that some of these Standing Stones are better than others.

 <p>
  At the beginning of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , Standing Stones are quickly presented to the player, but one shouldn't worry too much about choosing the best
  <strong>
   Standing Stone
  </strong>
  at this point in the story – a player's choice of Standing Stone blessing is not permanent in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . If the Dragonborn finds a Standing Stone out in the world with a buff that they like more than their currently selected one, all players have to do is just walk up to it, interact, and accept the swap. Without doing anything else, players will switch to the new Standing Stone and gain its benefits instantly.

 <p>
  But the Dragonborn doesn't necessarily have to
  <em>
   only
  </em>
  equip one Standing Stone
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  buff. Normally, the Dragonborn can only have one Standing Stone active at a time. But with the Aetherial Crown, a helmet that can be unlocked by following the Aetherium Forge questline "Lost To The Ages" in the
  <em>
   Dawnguard
  </em>
  DLC, players are given one more "slot."

 <p>
  With the Aetherial Crown equipped, the Dragonborn's current Standing Stone buff will remain in their Active Effects, while the new one will essentially be applied to the Crown itself. Players will always retain their original Standing Stone (unless replaced), but the
  <strong>
   Standing Stone
  </strong>
  buff tied to the Crown will only be active while it is equipped. For instance, players could activate The Tower for the Crown to have access to its Unlock spell when needed but equip other Helms during combat.

 <p>
  Choosing the Atronach Stone is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it lets the player convert half the damage of enemy spells into Magicka, preventing damage. However, the blessing also makes the player's Magicka regenerate 50% slower – this makes absorbing enemy spells a necessary means to the player's spellcasting ends.

 <p>
  The blessing is balanced somewhat by a slight bonus to the player's maximum Magicka, but ultimately, this ability will lead to players taking more hits when it's usually best to take less. This blessing is situationally ideal for a spellcaster who expects to face other spellcasters, but it's not great for 24/7 use on any character.

  Another double-edged sword, the Apprentice Stone, is in many ways the polar opposite of the Atronach Stone. This
  <em>
   Skyrim

  Standing Stone lets the player regenerate Magicka twice as fast but also makes them twice as vulnerable to magic-based attacks. Instead of taking spells to the dome to regenerate Magicka, the player must dodge incoming spells to maximize this Stone's potential.

  The Apprentice Standing Stone can be found in a marsh in Hjaalmarch. The easiest way to find this Standing Stone is to head to Solitude and look at the Dragonborn's compass. At the docks, the icon for the Standing Stone should appear. Alternatively, head to Morthal and head northwest into the swamp to find the Apprentice Stone.

  Accepting the blessing of the Tower Stone grants the player the unique ability to unlock any Expert-level lock or below without having to go through the lockpicking mini-game. This Standing Stone ability can only be used once each day, though, and the player must either play long enough or wait long enough before being able to use it again.

  This Standing Stone in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is best used right at the end of a long, arduous dungeon, after fighting several high-power enemies before the final encounter. If the Dragonborn uses their power on their recently slain foes, they can sit back and watch the fun as these corpses turn against their former allies.

  The Lord Stone is a popular choice for front-line fighters, as its blessing increases a player's defense in two major ways. Not only is the player's physical defense increased, but they are also given a 25% Resist Magic effect. However, with its ability to protect a player from both physical and magical attacks, the Lord Stone is an excellent choice for almost any playstyle.

 <p>
  This is especially true for players who don't want to waste valuable game time tracking down unique magical armor found throughout Skyrim. It's simple, but it's effectively the best way to increase the player's defense without picking up new gear.

 <p>
  The Lord Stone can be found far to the north of the province of Skyrim. From Whiterun, get a horse and begin trekking directly northward on the road. After a long way, the Dragonborn must head northeast until a fork in the road appears. Take the road west, then head into the western mountains just south of Fort Dunstad. The Lord Stone is found just north of the Shrine to Mehrunes Dagon.

  The Lady Stone is a Standing Stone in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  that improves the player's ability to heal and regenerate stamina. Under this Standing Stone's blessing, the player will get a 25% boost to their health and stamina regeneration – it's a simple one, but it's quite effective for close-combat characters.

  The Lady Standing Stone can be found in Falkreath Hold, relatively close to the start of the game. Starting from the city of Falkreath itself, head directly north and swim across Lake Illnata to find a small island with the Lady Stone standing upon it. If players reach Half-Moon Mill on the road leading north from Falkreath, then they can also head directly east to find the same island.

  Once the tutorial mission is complete, players are tasked with heading to Riverwood (and, eventually, Whiterun). But if a slight detour is made, or if the player follows Ralof, the player will find themselves in the presence of the Guardian Stones. These represent the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief, and they provide new players with a Standing Stone blessing right away.

  The Warrior Stone lets the player improve all combat skills 20% faster. These include One-Handed, Two-Handed, Unarmed, Smithing, and Block. This Standing Stone blessing is ideal for those who intend to focus on physical combat or who wish to spec into a new close combat skill.

  The Thief Stone is another Guardian Stone, this time with an emphasis on stealth-related skills – it increases the rate the player can learn Thief-related skills by 20%. These skills include Pickpocket, Sneak, Lockpicking, Light Armor, Speech, Alchemy, and Archery. The Thief Stone blessing is ideal for thieves, assassins, and rangers who wish to take things a little more stealthily.

  The Thief Stone is also useful for characters looking to pick up alchemy, speech, or lockpicking, as these skills are all useful no matter what class the player plays.

  The Mage Stone lets the player learn all magic skills 20% faster. These include Enchanting, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, and Restoration. The Mage Stone blessing is ideal for spellcasters and magic-users, but it's also useful for quickly leveling a new magic skill, even for characters who haven't touched the Mage-related skills in their playthrough.

  While a player can only have one of the Guardian Stone blessings active at once, players who wish to increase all of their skills at once should consider heading to the Bards College in Solitude. There, players will encounter a series of miscellaneous tasks, and completing each one will grant a slight boost to every single skill.

  The Shadow Stone is found in The Rift appropriately near Nightingale Hall, a location that can be visited during the Thieves Guild questline. From Riften, head directly south and leave the road to head into the wooded hills. The Shadow Stone is found on these hills overlooking the area - its icon should appear before going too far, as it's practically next to Riften.

  In
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls

  lore, the Serpent is the most unique constellation in existence. Unlike all the others, the Serpent moves about the night sky as it hunts the other signs. Only the three Guardians are capable of protecting the others from the wrath of the Serpent. It is also said that those individuals born under the sign of the Serpent will live the most unique and legendary lives of all. Some may become the greatest of heroes, while others will become the most feared of villains.

  Taking the blessing of The Serpent Stone grants the player a once-a-day ranged spell that can be used to damage

  paralyze an enemy from far away. Most paralyzation abilities require close range, making this ability particularly special.

  's Standing Stone of the Serpent can be found on an icy island in the Sea of Ghosts. From the College of Winterhold, head directly east and slightly north to find this frozen island. It's a little bit easier to go from Skytemple Ruins slightly to the north of the College of Winterhold, as it's more of a direct eastward route.

  One of the best benefits of marriage in
  <em>

  is the Lover's Comfort effect. Sleeping in the same bed as a spouse grants the player this effect, which allows them to improve all skills 15% faster. What if the player wants that sweet bonus but doesn't want to engage with one of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's eligible bachelors or bachelorettes, though? That's where the Lover Stone comes in.

  Widely considered the
  <strong>
   best Standing Stone in
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Lover Stone grants the Lover's Comfort effect all the time. While the Guardian Stones allow a player to increase roughly a third of their skills 20% faster, increasing
  <em>
   all
  </em>
  skills is the better choice, even if it is technically five percent slower for some skills. Unfortunately, the Lover Stone and Lover's Comfort effects do not stack.

  The Lover Standing Stone can be found in The Reach, a stone's throw from Markarth. Leave Markarth and head east until the road branches north. Follow this road to Kolskeggr Mine, then take the road west for just a second. Look for a sloping way up the mountain to the west of Kolskeggr, and climb up to find The Lover Stone overlooking the valley.

  Included with
  <em>
   Skyrim Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  are a huge variety of fan-made mods that were originally part of the Creation Club in
  <em>
   Skyrim Special Edition.
  </em>
  One of these mods is the highly-praised Survival Mode, which turns
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  from a carefree RPG romp into a much more immersive – and much more dangerous – adventure.

 <p>
  Alongside a variety of changes to the game comes a change to Standing Stones; players must make an offering of Gold to be blessed and cleanse themselves of disease. In Survival Mode, disease is more rampant, and Gold is harder to come by, so players should double-check their wallet before heading out into the wilds, lest they get rejected with no way to fast travel back.

  The Goblin Queen's Journey was added to
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  in July 2024 for players who are at Arena 12 or above. You can switch to this mode by clicking on the Game Modes button on the right side of the Battle button in the main menu and choosing Goblin Queen's Journey.

  In this game mode, the King Tower is replaced with a unique Goblin Queen Tower. The Goblin Queen Tower will have the same level as your main King Tower. You also get a new, upgradable Tower Troop called Baby Goblins.

 <p>
  The Goblin Queen Tower has a unique effect in the game. Whenever you deploy a goblin card on the field, a green bar starts to fill up. Once it fills out completely, a swarm of Baby Goblins gets tossed towards your opponent's side of the arena and starts attacking enemy troops. Players can take advantage of this unique ability to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory in the match.

  Goblin Giant is one of the most popular win conditions in the Goblin Queen's Journey because of how well it pairs with certain cards. It will let you build up your Goblin Queen's ability bar quickly so that you can overwhelm your foes as soon as the game steps into the double elixir stage.

 <p>
  The Evo Goblin Giant is a no-brainer when you're playing this deck. Not only is the Evo itself strong, but it also lets you quickly build up the ability bar since you'll be spawning Goblins as soon as your Goblin Giant's HP drops below half. It's a beefy beatdown win condition that works well in this game mode.

  The main support troop for your push is the Sparky and the Goblin Machine. Yes, it's a bit draining on your elixir bar, but in the double elixir stage of the game, you should be able to pull it off without any issues. Throw a Rage spell as soon as your Goblin Giant and Sparky cross the bridge, and watch your opponent scramble, trying to defend against it.

 <p>
  For defense, you've got plenty of excellent cards as well. Both Goblin Gang and Spear Goblins have low elixir costs and can defend against almost anything your opponent whips up. Evo Zap will help you play against Log Bait decks. Lastly, Goblin Demolisher and Goblin Machine can defend against swarms and tanky troops.

  For fans of fast-paced cycle decks, the Goblin Drill Poison Cycle is a must-try for this game mode. You'll have to switch up a few cards in the deck to make it more suitable for the Goblin Queen's Journey, but you won't notice too much difference in playstyle.

  The devastating combo of Evo Goblin Drill and Poison is still the main focus of this deck. You'll have to cycle your cards quickly to get as many Evo Goblin Drill on your opponent's towers as possible. Also, make sure you put the Poison down to take out any low-HP units that your opponent deploys in defense.

 <p>
  Instead of going with the Wall Breakers, you'll be using Suspicious Bush to apply secondary pressure on your opponent. The idea is the same: use it to bait out their defensive troops and leave your Goblin Drill free to wreak havoc on your opponent's towers. You'll be using the Evo Goblin Cage for your defensive building, which isn't as good as the Inferno Tower, but it gets the job done.

 <p>
  Goblin Demolisher and Goblin Gang are your main defensive troops and bring out the Goblin Machine when you've got a big tank like Golem walking down the lane towards your tower. You can swap it out with a Valkyrie if you want, but the Goblin Machine will help you fill-up the ability bar faster.

  It's been a while since Log Bait has been out of the meta, at least in the top ladder, but it's as strong as ever in Goblin Queen's Journey. This deck allows you to max out the ability bar in a flash. On top of that, players can also toss in the new free champion Goblinstein, as it fits perfectly in the deck.

 <p>
  This deck has an average elixir cost of 2.6, which means it's already fast. On top of that, you also have a champion in the deck to activate the three-card cycle. That means when Goblinstein is deployed, you'll be able to cycle through all your cards in the deck in a flash, maxing out your ability bar before you know it.

 <p>
  But this deck has one big weakness. Since you don't have a Rocket in the deck like most Log Bait decks, you'll have to rely on successful plays with the Evo Goblin Barrel to get tower damage. However, since your deck is extremely fast, it shouldn't be too difficult to out-cycle your opponent's Arrows or The Log.

 <p>
  Play aggressively from the start of the game and start cycling your Suspicious Bush, Goblin Barrel, and Princess to get chip damage on the opponent's tower. Use Dart Goblin And Goblinstein for defense. Goblins in the deck also can help you DPS down any big tanks your opponents might use.

  Despite requests for secrecy from Nintendo, it looks like
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch Online
  </strong>
  users are starting to divulge details regarding its upcoming Playtest Program, suggesting that the Big N’s mystery project could be some sort of MMO game. Fans were excited earlier this month when Nintendo announced it would be testing out a new feature for its Nintendo Switch Online service, and if these leaks are to be believed, it could very well be its first real stab at a massively multiplayer online experience.

 <p>
  The Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program is set to run from October 23 to November 5, and around 10,000 subscribers to the service’s Expansion Pass tier will be able to take part. Beyond these specifics, Nintendo hasn’t divulged what exactly will be tested, only describing it as a “new feature.” That lack of information hasn’t kept gamers from getting excited, and could very well have been why all of the Playtest Program spots were filled in under a minute. In preparation for the test, Nintendo has reportedly requested that participants refrain from sharing any information about the feature being tested. As one might expect, though, this request is largely being ignored, and screenshots and other details of the playtest have begun leaking onto social media faster than Nintendo can have them removed.

 <p>
  According to reports from sources like The Verge and Kotaku, these leaks reveal that Nintendo is working on a MMO game where the main objective is for players to work together to “fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet.” They do this by laying down “Beacons” that create zones and further develop the environment, with the overall goal being to cover the sphere-shaped grid representing the planet with beacons. Aside from these Beacon zones, players can also head to a social hub known as the “Dev Core” to level up their characters, acquire items, and interact with other players, something that they will likely be able to test out to some extent during the Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program.

  Customization seems to be a key aspect of this Nintendo Switch MMO, as players will be able to customize their Beacons to some extent, though they won’t be able to do the same in other players’ zones. Nintendo also describes features for sharing custom content, though players must pass an in-game test to show that they “understand the importance of respectful communication” before they can access these features.

 <p>
  From the looks of it, Nintendo’s MMO could be shaping up to be something like a massively multiplayer mix of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  , with potentially thousands of players shaping the in-game world together and sharing custom content with one another. Such a title would certainly stand out from the company’s usual selection of games, so it’ll be interesting to see how things pan out beyond the Playtest Program.

  After saving Princess Eupha and defeating the Dragon God, the party will return to the Village to defeat the Human who escaped. Once the threat to the Village has been dealt with, Eupha will join the protagonist's party, and shortly after, players can find her standing beside the Inn Well. During the conversation, Edeni will suggest that Eupha visit the Land of Ceremony and complete the Trial of Malnova.

  After talking to Euphad and accepting the quest, you can talk to Edeni to change the weather for the Land of Ceremony. This choice is entirely up to you, as changing the weather allows you to get extra press turns when hitting enemy weaknesses. The fight will be more challenging if you do not change the weather, but it will grant you more
  <strong>
   EXP
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   A-EXP
  </strong>
  .

  After this, chart a course for the Land of Ceremony. During the journey, you can spend time with Eupha to increase your
  <strong>
   Imagination
  </strong>
  by 6 points. There are several Trance crystals inside the Dungeon, and if you did not change the weather, you can farm the enemies here to level up your Archetypes.

  At the end of the Dungeon, you will face

  Junah's
  <strong>
   Crimson Flame

  can target both enemies and deal heavy magic damage, which is crucial in this fight. Eupha does not have normal Fire damage-dealing skills, but her Synthesis

   Summon Dragon God

  deals severe Fire damage to enemies and removes buffs. You can use inherited skills on your party members to add

   Hamaon

  The Summoner is a unique Archetype in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantzio
  </em>
  that has Ice weakness and blocks Dark attacks. The Summoner only has two base Skills for dealing Wind damage and healing allies. Apart from this, players must acquire Talisman, which they can use in the
  <strong>
   Summon Experiments
  </strong>
  to create Summons that the Archetype can use in battle. Elite Summoners are much more powerful, but you must unlock the
  <strong>
   Devil Summoner
  </strong>
  to access them.

 <p>
  The Summoner is a versatile Archetype with a lot of utility and can output massive amounts of damage, making most fights in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  a breeze. Eupha is the most suited to the Summoner Archetype, but you must Master it on the Protagonist if you plan on acquiring the
  <strong>
   Archetype Hero
  </strong>
  Trophy/Achievement.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise is massive and iconic, leading as one of the most played and longest-tenured first-person shooter franchises. The franchise includes many subseries within, none more famous and beloved than the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  series of games. Starting with
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops
  </em>
  , which introduced players to a memorable cast of characters in the campaign and a plethora of series staples. The
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  series continued to grow and develop based on the formula the first entry created.

 <p>
  Now, 15 years on from the release of the first
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  title, players are eagerly awaiting the 6th installment. A sequel to
  <em>
   Black Ops: Cold War
  </em>
  and building upon many of its innovations,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  includes many returning features, but plenty of brand-new ones that haven't been seen within the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Franchise.

 <p>
  Maps are at the core of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  multiplayer. That goes without saying.
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  maps are iconic and infinitely replayable, some maintaining the standard three-lane routing whilst others offer intense and sporadic engagements in close-quarters combat. As more
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles release, the maps get more intricate and compelling, offering incredible design and atmosphere.

 <p>
  Whilst new maps are a staple of each release,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is unique in the sense that each launch map is entirely new. The Call of Duty franchise can sometimes rely heavily on nostalgia, providing players with remakes or re-releases of iconic maps from past games. Whilst nostalgia is fun, making new memories with brand-new maps is a preferable option for many players.

  Camo grinding in
  <em>
   Call of Duty

  is the act of completing weapon camo challenges in order to unlock and utilize new weapon camos. Each weapon has a gold camo, requiring all challenges to be completed, as well as a camo for completing all challenges of a certain weapon class, then one final one for completing every weapon mastery camo challenge in the game.

  In recent releases, such as
  <em>
   Black Ops: Cold War
  </em>
  , players have been able to unlock a mastery camo for zombies as well as multiplayer. In
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , for the first time in the franchise, there will also be mastery challenges and camos for the beloved battle royale mode, Warzone. This allows players an entirely new way to play Warzone, as well as provides completionists with a new set of camo challenges to complete, on top of multiplayer and zombies.

  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has seen a range of modes throughout the franchise. Some players stick vehemently to the core modes; Search and Destroy, Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, and Domination. Be it through familiarity or because they are the most played modes. Other players prefer more casual modes such as Gun Game or Infected. Regardless of where players stand on the inclusion of modes, it is fair to say that the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise has trialed many new and interesting modes in its tenure.

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  aims to introduce a brand-new mode, never before seen within the franchise, entitled Kill Order. This mode sees one player picked at random as a HVT, who accumulates score through survival and has increased health along with Warzone armor plates. Players must eliminate the HVT of the opposite team whilst protecting their own. This is an innovative mode that adds a new level of strategy and tension to the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  gameplay loop.

 <p>
  Audio is a hotly debated topic within the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise, specifically pertaining to footstep sounds and their balancing when compared to other sounds in the game. Some players wish them to be loud, allowing a chance to hear opponents coming, whilst others believe that this strips away the run-and-gun core of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  . Despite this debate, it could be argued that sound design, outside of footstep audio, has been somewhat neglected throughout the recent entries in the series.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  aims to change this, with an entirely new audio system. This system changes the way sounds play indoors, allowing for reverberation and further immersion through sound. It also aims to ensure players can tell the range of shots more clearly, adding in new ways for sound to travel throughout the map so that players can determine threats through sound.

  Movement mechanics are at the very core of many first-person shooter titles, especially the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games. The
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games have always been known for fast-paced and frantic movement, opting to allow players a run-and-gun arcade style that defines the franchise. Movement has always been developed throughout the games, with some, like
  <em>
   Modern Warfare (2019)
  </em>
  aiming to slow down players, before movement technology evolved within
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , which allowed for incredibly mobile slide-cancelling.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , however, introduces the most innovative and game-changing movement systems, in the form of omnidirectional movement, shortened to omnimovement. This omnidirectional movement technology allows players to maintain momentum and speed through fast strafing and backward movement. It also allows players to dive into prone in a system that is not dissimilar to the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Max Payne
   </strong>
  </em>
  series. When in prone, players can utilize the new supine prone system that allows for complete 360-degree vision. Overall, omnimovement not only changes the core movement mechanics but the entire feel and pace of
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  6.

  Since 1992,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat
   </strong>
  </em>
  has garnered fans worldwide with its arcade-style fighting game. Now, the series
  <em>
  </em>
  is even more popular, with in-depth titles being released on various platforms. Though the first game only had a roster of seven characters (and three unplayable fighters), its
  <em>
  </em>
  subsequent entries
  <em>
  </em>
  have developed an arsenal of Kombatants that have contributed to the game's story in many ways.

 <p>
  While some older characters remain as popular as ever, several newer fighters have made big names for themselves, and fans hope to see them in future releases, too. From the classic arcade machines and consoles to movies and books, the famous faces of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  are household names in the video game world.

    Updated on October 21, 2024, by David Heath:
   </strong>
   Mortal Kombat 1's 'Khaos Reigns' update finally came out, and it's a fitting name, as MK1's life thus far has been chaotic. Its existence was leaked in a memo, the game's new setting is more divisive than the last reboot, and its wacky guest characters have left fans more tired than intrigued (the killer from Scream? Conan the Barbarian?). That's perhaps why, despite being considered part of the 'Big 3' with Street Fighter and Tekken, it was one of the bottom 3 in entrant numbers for Evo 2024.

 <p>
  Though compared to past fighting game-based fiascoes, like Street Fighter X Tekken or Marvel Vs Capcom: Infinite, MK1's troubles are more like mild hiccups. Particularly as the update came with some fan favorites, like Noob Saibot and the redesigned Cyrax and Sektor. So, now's a fitting time to look at more of
  <strong>
   Mortal Kombat's most iconic characters
  </strong>
  .

  <strong>
   Rain
  </strong>
  wasn't meant to be a playable character. He was hidden in
  <em>
   UMK3
  </em>
  's intro as a gag reference to the Prince album 'Purple Rain'. But much like the red ninjas Ermac and Skarlet, people wondered how they could play as him, whether they got the reference or not. So, he was made an official character as an Edenian prince who inherited his water-based powers from his father, the god Argus. His divine blood gave him a chip on his shoulder, where his arrogant, self-serving personality saw him become one of the series' slimiest characters.

  players had another reason to hate him, as his Water Bubble held the opponent in place for a nasty combo. The worst being his Super Kick, which he could use to juggle his opponent infinitely. It became notorious enough to become a brutality in
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  . In
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  , he lost his divine and regal status, but remains an arrogant water mage. However, he seems to have taken a humble turn, as his flooding of Seido has made him more penitent and willing to face his flaws than before.

  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  already had yellow, blue, green, gray, and black ninjas, let alone the blue and purple female ninjas, and they'd add more spectrum-based shinobi along the way. Even so, they must've felt the need to diversify the cast a little for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 3
  </em>
  , as Sub-Zero took off his mask, Scorpion took off completely, and Smoke became a robot to join the new robo-ninjas,
  <strong>
   Cyrax
  </strong>
  and Sektor. They were part of the Lin Kuei's Cyber Initiative to make their forces more effective in combat, and subservient to the Grand Master's will.

 <p>
  Cyrax was one of their more reluctant members, an African ninja who managed to break his programming and fought to regain his humanity. In the classic timeline, he had help from Sonya and Jax, while Sub-Zero managed it in the alternative timelime in
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  . In
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  's new timeline, Cyrax is a woman in a cyber suit who breaks from the Lin Kuei to aid her childhood friend, Kuai Liang. This direction adds some interesting wrinkles to the old robot-with-a-soul plot.

  <strong>
   Sonya Blade
  </strong>
  was among the first
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  fighters to be introduced to the world. Originally, she was going to be a male character called Kurtis Stryker, but with
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  's Chun-Li proving to be one of their rivals' biggest hits, the developers thought the character would catch on better as a woman. Needless to say, it worked, given Sonya's status as an
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  mainstay. As a Special Forces agent, she was originally on the hunt for Kano, a weapons dealer for the Black Dragon crime syndicate.

  He killed her old partner, and she sought revenge, tracking him down to the
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  tournament. Other than her incredible tenacity, one of Sonya's distinctive characteristics was her ability to blast energy beams. Sometimes, they're technological, but other times they're as mystical as her immolating blown kisses. While she's one of the sterner characters in the series, she's shown her softer side with fellow Special Forces agent Jax, film star Johnny Cage, and her daughter Cassie.

  That latter attribute sounds odd, yet there aren't a lot of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  characters from Down Under.
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  's Craig Marduk and
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  's Jeffry McWild are big hitters, but only Kano received the full Aussie characterization. Not that this was the plan. In
  <em>
   MK'92
  </em>
  , he was merely a weapons dealer for the Black Dragon syndicate. It wasn't until actor Trevor Goddard depicted him in the 1995
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  movie with an accent that he was associated with Australia (which is ironic as Goddard was trying to make him sound like a Londoner).

  Aside from that, he made for a nice, vile counterpart to the human heroes. Willing to sell out Earthrealm for a buck, let alone his 'friends,' he's one of the scummiest, most untrustworthy characters in the series. Yet he delights in being a villain so much that he makes for an entertaining watch, no matter which game he appears in. He's like Shang Tsung in this way, only with worse manners, but it was just as satisfying to see him get the business end of a Nut Punch.

  After Sonya Blade appeared in
  <em>
   MK'92
  </em>
  , Midway planned to use the 'Kurtis Stryker' character for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  instead. They would be Sonya's commanding officer and a headband-wearing kickboxer. Fearing they looked too similar to
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  's Balrog, the character was reimagined as a muscleman with a penchant for powerful dashing punches, hard ground pounds, and yelling "Gotcha!" after catching his goes in midair for a nasty backbreaker. This time, 'Stryker' became
  <strong>
   Jackson "Jax" Briggs
  </strong>
  .

  Surprisingly, his most iconic appearance wouldn't come about until
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 3
  </em>
  , when the character got metal arms as an upgrade. Other timelines, like in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 9
  </em>
  , would make them full prosthetics (ironic, as his
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  fatality involved ripping off his opponent's arms). Either way, he's become famous for his proverbial guns, smashing his foes with them in a variety of ways. Not as stiff as Sonya, but more serious than Johnny Cage, he has an underrated charm that's made him a series' mainstay.

  The 2000s era of
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  games, from
  <em>
   Deadly Alliance
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Armageddon
  </em>
  , are often unfairly maligned.
  <em>
  </em>
  While they weren't the strongest fighting games around, they played out quite well for their time. That said, it's hard to defend their original characters.
  <em>
   MK: DA
  </em>
  's Hsu Hao is often the target of ire for fans and critics alike, but at least his weird Village People-esque look is memorable. Mavado, Dairou, Kira, and Hotaru were much more generic and forgettable. Yet they had their highlights, too.

  The brightest was
  <strong>
   Kenshi
  </strong>
  , a blind swordsman who gained telekinetic and telepathic powers via his katana, Sento. He originally sought revenge against Shang Tsung. Then, by
  <em>
   MK9
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   MKX
  </em>
  , he was after the Red Dragon crime gang.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  changed him again to an ex-yakuza seeking to free his family from their grasp, losing his sight to Mileena in a mission gone awry. Either way, he'd use his powers to throw his opponents around or use his sword to dice them into bite-sized chunks.

  Nowadays,
  <strong>
   Ermac
  </strong>
  is familiar as
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  's gestalt entity: a compression of hundreds if not thousands of souls within one body, using their combined strength and their telekinetic powers to pull their opponents apart. It's stuck around since Midway began redesigning their pallette-swapped ninjas in the 3D era, where they've sometimes been a good guy (
  <em>
   MK: D
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  ) or a bad guy (
  <em>
   MK9, MKX
  </em>
  ). But their true fame comes from being the first urban legend character in the series.

  The
  <em>
   MK 1992
  </em>
  cabinet had an in-built menu that would record how many times the cabinet had error macros, or "Ermacs." Fans thought this meant there was another secret character in the game. Possibly a red ninja, as behind-the-scenes footage showed that the ninja outfit was originally red to stand out against the blue screen. Not only would Midway eventually make him real, but it would inspire similar legends about other characters (Scarlet - a red female ninja) and also inspire Midway to mess with their audience (
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  has a "Kano Transformation" ticker on its menu).

  Kitana has her fans (the weapon, not her enthusiasts), and Mileena has her daggers.
  <strong>
   Jade
  </strong>
  has her staff and razor-edged boomerang projectiles. Or at least she would once she became playable in
  <em>
   UMK3

  . She made her debut in
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  as perhaps the first secret female character in fighting games, where players had to win a match with just Low Kick attacks and no blocking. Once they took her on, they'd find out she was basically Kitana, with fans, only green, dark-skinned, faster, and immune to projectiles.

  She'd later become established as Kitana's best friend, the Kung Lao to her Liu Kang, swinging her staff around to shut down her opponents. Jade's a fairly underrated character, as she's been pretty low on the tier list for most of her appearances. But whenever she appears, she's always a fan favorite, whether she's more outgoing a la

  didn't have much to him to begin with. He was an all-black ninja palette swap players could fight if they won 25 matches in a row on
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  , and his name was the surnames of
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  creators Ed Boon and John Tobias spelled backwards. Then, he became playable in
  <em>
   MKT
  </em>
  and became so broken with his Teleport Slam juggles and block-disabling projectiles he was often banned from tournaments. It wasn't until
  <em>
   MK: Deception
  </em>
  that his plot got fleshed out.

  He was Bi-Han, the original Sub-Zero, resurrected as a shadow wraith by Quan Chi. Though he often followed orders from Shao Kahn and Shinnok, his allegiance was ultimately to himself and his Brotherhood of Shadows. 'Khaos Reigns' sees Bi-Han return to this dark visage, mixing his opponents up with his portals, projectiles, and shadow clones. The additional sibling rivalry with Kuai Liang made him a more interesting character than being another ninja, alongside his contrasting powers to fellow undead fighter Scorpion.

  was Kuai Liang's friend when he took up the Sub-Zero moniker, though he only appeared in
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  as a secret character, where opponents had to press Down+Start on the Portal stage whenever they got a "Toasty." Like his future human appearances, he basically played like Scorpion on speed with smoke bombs. He'd teleport across the screen, peppering his opponent with swift strikes, and even had Scorpion's spear.

  Even when cyberized, he was deadly, from blowing up the earth in his
  <em>
   UMK3
  </em>
  fatality, to backing up Noob Saibot as a deadly tag team in
  <em>
   MK: Deception
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   MK9
  </em>
  saw him avoid becoming a robot but did see him dominate online play as his combos did plenty of damage, were hard to defend against, and were easy to learn. His rebooted form in
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  also saw him rise through the ranks, inducing salt with his smoke balls and range. He may not be as popular as his yellow and blue counterparts, but he's possibly the strongest ninja in the series gameplay-wise.

  Although
  <strong>
   Kitana
  </strong>
  wasn't among
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  's first fighters in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  , she's arguably the most iconic woman in the series. Her blue ninja outfits, sharp fan blades, and key role in the story as Liu Kang's rival-turned-lover made her a staple character. She's an Edenian, a long-lived human-like race whose world of Edenia got merged with Outworld before they set their sights on Earthrealm.

  She was adopted by Shao Kahn and served him dutifully until she discovered he had murdered her father, King Jerrod, and had Shang Tsung create a more psychotic yet more loyal clone of herself. Or so it went in the original timeline. After decades of being at each other's throats,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  reset the timeline to make the two twin sisters, who would aid each other against General Shao and other schemers in Outworld.

  Kitana may be more iconic, though she isn't necessarily the most popular woman in
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  . Her monstrous half-sister
  <strong>
   Mileena
  </strong>
  has often given her a run for her money by essentially being her evil counterpart. Made by Shang Tsung when he mixed Kitana's DNA with a Tarkatan, Mileena is almost an exact duplicate of the Edenian Princess, except for her mouth full of fangs and hunger for flesh. With her mask, she's often used her sex appeal to pull in unsuspecting foes, only to reveal her true face and eat them alive.

  Her mix of seduction and horror made her a perfect fit as the anti-Kitana, as she'd try her best to get one-up over her "twin sister." But even with Kitana's turn to the dark side in
  <em>
   MKX
  </em>
  , she'd find herself coming up short. But it did add more nuance to her character as Shao Kahn's "true daughter" and heir to Outworld's throne. It led to
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  rebooting her as Kitana's true twin sister whose toothy mouth and bloodlust is now a medical condition she has to control. Some may prefer her as a villain to a hero, but she'll still chew her foes up and spit them out.

  Before it became a fighting game,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  began life as a tie-in project for the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie
  <em>
   Universal Soldier
  </em>
  . Once that fell through, creators Ed Boon and John Tobias commemorated their near-run with the Muscles from Brussels by creating
  <strong>
   Johnny Cage
  </strong>
  , a Hollywood star who lucked into the first
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  tournament to revive his flagging career. He dressed like Van Damme's character from the movie and also did some of his moves, like the infamous Nut Punch.

 <p>
  His smug attitude, contrasted with his heart of gold, made him a neat source of levity throughout the series. When all the gore and mutilation became too much, he'd lighten the atmosphere with a movie line or a smarmy one-liner. He'd even break the 4th wall, giving the player his autograph, or turning his old glitches into features (e.g. uppercutting his opponent's head off 3 times somehow). Without him cutting his foes down physically and verbally,
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  just wouldn't feel the same.

  At first, Johnny Cage seemed like the equivalent of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  's Ken to Liu Kang's proverbial Ryu. Yet the Shaolin monk and the arrogant movie star didn't have as much in common with each other as
  <em>
  </em>
  Capcom's shotos. So, Midway made a new Shaolin monk in
  <strong>
   Kung Lao
  </strong>
  . He's a descendant of the Great Kung Lao, who first stopped Outworld from taking over Earthrealm by defeating Goro. Unfortunately, Goro got his own back at the next tournament and killed him.

  Kung Lao joined the White Lotus and trained alongside Liu Kang to avenge his ancestor and aid Earthrealm. He's often talked down to by his friends and enemies, and treated as a lesser monk compared to Liu Kang. Yet he doesn't hold it against his friend. Probably because he's arguably got more style than him anyway. His razor-brimmed hat made him stand out from the crowd, cutting through foes, and lopping off their heads if players threw it just right in his
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  fatality. Few characters in
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  could match his panache.

  <strong>
   Liu Kang
  </strong>
  was the original hero of
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  's canon storyline, serving as Earthrealm's champion and beating Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Shinnok, and more. But
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 9
  </em>
  would switch things up, where he'd lose faith in Raiden, get killed, and become an evil Revenant. Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and her daughter Cassie would step in as the new heroes. But ultimately, by
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  , it took a time imbalance to bring the good Liu Kang back to aid Raiden and co. once again.

 <p>
  By the end of that game, he'd go on to replace his old mentor as Earth's new protector demigod in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . Nonetheless, fans remember him best as the red headband-wearing human, serving as the original Shaolin monk of the series. He'd beat foes and woo Kitana with his Bruce Lee-style moves, acting as the straight man to his more comic rivals in Johnny Cage and Kung Lao. His turning into a dragon and chomping on his opponents left an impression as well.

  As the franchise's very first main antagonist,
  <strong>
   Shang Tsung
  </strong>
  struck fear in the hearts of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  's long-time fans. Shang Tsung is a brilliant sorcerer from Outworld who was banished to Earthrealm. After taking control of the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  tournament, his champion, Goro, had become undefeated for centuries. He would've opened the door for his lord, Shao Kahn, to invade if the Great Kung Lao hadn't beaten Goro and reset the count on the victories Outworld needed to merge the realms.

 <p>
  This set the stage for the original
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  game, where Shang Tsung served as the final boss. He wasn't too difficult, but his ability to shapeshift into the rest of the cast gave players pause for thought. Even when he became playable in the sequels, he could keep them guessing over which form he'd change into next. The 3D era curtailed this, but like his plots, Shang Tsung's gameplay offers other ways to bamboozle opponents. He's the snake to Liu Kang's dragon and every bit as sly as the comparison suggests.

  as 'Bonestorm,' they didn't use copies of Liu Kang, Raiden, or the ninjas to represent the game. They used four-armed warriors akin to its original sub-boss,
  <strong>
   Goro
  </strong>
  . The game hyped him up as a big deal as; in between its starting screen and intro, it would declare 'Goro Lives' and reveal the giant warrior in all his monstrous glory. Even if players got past the Endurance battles, they'd have a hard time avoiding Goro's stomps, projectiles, and heavy punches.

  He was the prince of a race of half-men, half-dragon hybrids called Shokan, who served as Shang Tsung's champion at the
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  tournaments. His allegiances have switched over the years, where he's aided Shao Kahn in some games and fought with Earthrealm and the Edenians in others. The game has added other Shokan characters over the years, like Kintaro and Sheeva, but they haven't managed to outdo Goro.

  As of
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   Raiden
  </strong>
  may as well be two different characters. He essentially swapped roles with his former champion, Liu Kang, being reborn in his new universe as Earthrealm's new Shaolin monk champion, complete with his friendship with Kung Lao. Nonetheless, it's the original Raiden who's the most famous, where he gathered Earthrealm's finest warriors to defend it at the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  tournaments, often training the kombatants throughout various
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  games.

  Not that this was always the plan. His ending in
  <em>
   MK'92
  </em>
  saw him inadvertently destroy the Earth after organizing a fighting tournament for all the Elder Gods ("Have a nice day"). His mentor role was established from
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  onward, with the occasional twist in the tale. He's sometimes turned to the dark side, yet the games have preferred to keep him good, often stepping in to handle things personally when needed. As one of the strongest characters in
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  's canon, he's a formidable force.

  In the original timeline,
  <strong>
   Shao Kahn
  </strong>
  was the Emperor of Outworld and sought to take over Earthrealm via Shang Tsung's
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  tournament. If his Outworld forces achieved enough victories in a row, he'd be allowed by the Elder Gods to merge Outworld with Earthrealm, just as he had done with other realms. Instead, Liu Kang defeated Shang Tsung, then defeated Kahn himself twice. Not that he had an easy time of it.

 <p>
  Shao Kahn is infamous as one of the hardest bosses in fighting game history, let alone just in
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  . With unblockable projectiles, armored attacks, and constant taunts ("You weak, pathetic fool!"), he wears the player down physically and mentally. Even after future games made him fairer, playable, and surprisingly low-tier in most of his appearances, he's the series' most iconic big bad boss. Shinnok, Kronika, Onaga, and the Deadly Alliance can't hold a candle to him.

  Until
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  redesigned him as a rather handsome ally to the good guys,
  <strong>
   Reptile
  </strong>
  had been treated like a jobber in the series. He was a goon for one big bad or another, and often left betrayed, murdered, or possessed as a 'reward.' It was an unfortunate turn of events for the fighting game genre's first secret character. If players followed his random clues in
  <em>
   MK'92
  </em>
  , they'd fight him as a green uber-ninja who had both Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves.

 <p>
  Once he became playable in
  <em>
   MK2
  </em>
  , he was given his own moves and character. He was (to his knowledge) of the reptile-like humanoid Saurian/Zaterran race and had special abilities he'd use in combat. Like spitting acid to fight against his enemies, and the ability to turn invisible, making him more difficult to strike. Then, he'd finish his foes off by ripping off their heads with his tongue and eating them. He may have been a ninja, but he was much more animalistic before
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  .

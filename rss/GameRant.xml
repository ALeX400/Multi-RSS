  ​​​If there was ever an essential class that players could choose just one from classic fantasy worlds, it would have to be wizards, right? They are some of the most iconic and imposing characters and have formed a core part of the genre ever since Gandalf the Gray was first introduced in Tolkien's
  <em>
   The Lords of the Rings
  </em>
  . Since then, wizards have flooded the genre, and naturally made their way into open-world video games where players can actually pick them as their go-to choice to play.

  There are so many fantastic RPGs with deep innovative game mechanics that correlate directly to wizards. Mastering magic abilities and spells can be some of the most interesting and intricate parts of open-world RPGs, and naturally, wizards are the best pick for those wishing to explore this path. Let's therefore take a look at which games allow players to play as a wizard in rich, vibrant open-world designs.

  The
  <em>
   Wizardry
  </em>
  franchise is one of the most iconic and important dungeon crawlers to have ever existed. It paved the way for fantasy games as we know them today with the first game in this series releasing all the way back in 1981 with
  <em>
   Wizardry: Proving Ground of the Mad Overlord
  </em>
  , which had a more recent remake. Even way back then, this series featured some intricate RPG mechanics where players had to seriously pay attention to their stats and abilities. Whilst not necessarily traditional open-world settings, players are given absolute freedom to explore open dungeons at their own pace and in whichever order they like, much of which is even procedurally generated!
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier titles featured a mechanic similar to
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  whereby spells and spell slots had to have a rest period before being used again, meaning players had to constantly micromanage their utilities. There are different spell classes in each title and new sets of robes to adorn in a vast labyrinth of seemingly endless rooms. It's the ultimate hardcore dungeon-crawler franchise and one of the best picks for players looking to play as a wizard.

  There aren't any traditional melee weapons or classes to be found in this epic open-world RPG. Instead,
  <em>
   Citadel: Forged With Fire
  </em>
  introduces a unique weapon system made with wizards specifically in mind. Everything is essentially enhanced by spells here, where players customize their spell loadouts based on certain schools of magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It features an intricate spellcasting system using a substance called Essence which players earn, and these can then be used to upgrade each school of magic and ultimately forge new spells. It goes much deeper than that too, as depending on how players craft and level their spells, stats like damage, range, and effectiveness can all vary greatly, making for some of the most authentic wizarding experiences in gaming. Pair that with being able to fly around a huge open world on broomsticks and there's a winning formula.

   Two Worlds 2
  </em>
  also features an impressively innovative spell-crafting experience using a system that the game refers to as DEMONS (Dynamic Enchantment, Magic, Occultism &amp; Necromancy System). Essentially, players can create spells from scratch by combining different magical elements which allows for some great trial and error in finding the perfect combinations. It also allows for some really creative gameplay as further effects can be stacked on top of each spell which means enemies might explode or levitate and then explode upon their death or upon the spell being cast.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a great spell sandbox system which makes it a great world to explore as a wizard. Magic in the game is so much more powerful than any of the other combat options, it actually makes players question why they would even consider not playing as a wizard. That being said, finding spell cards for the spellcrafting can be a bit tedious and it's not exactly a straightforward system. But it's certainly an amazing open-world title that is best experienced by players assuming the role of a wizard character!

  and
  <em>

  feature the two classes, Mage or Sorcerer. Both of which are essentially wizard classes with some slight variations. Spells are cast by charging them up, which often makes them seem extremely powerful. The wizarding gameplay here is also a lot more tactical than many other RPGs, perhaps more akin to that of an MMO. Positioning really matters and players won't be able to get away with simply button-mashing their spells.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  features one of the most impressive open worlds from recent RPG releases, and its fun and effective gameplay further enhances the quality of the game. Of course, players don't have to play as a wizard, but the sorcerer is definitely one of the most powerful and entertaining classes in the game, making it a perfect choice to play as a wizard.

  It's hard not to mention
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  when talking about wizards, and that makes
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  one of the best titles to examine when looking at games with wizard playable characters. Not only is it a fantastic open-world experience, but it also does a great job of nailing the wizarding mechanics that fans would expect from such a prominent franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  There aren't any classes to pick from here, because it's a given that players will be playing as a wizard, but they can nurture their own builds through learning new spells and equipping different wands. Combo-based spellcasting makes
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  a truly thrilling experience and the open world is designed to immerse the player in the wizarding world of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  . It's one of the ultimate wizarding experiences in gaming.

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  franchise is to gaming what
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  was to literature - genre-defining. Almost every fantasy title since the release of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls: Arena
  </em>
  in 1994 owes some form of inspiration to the series, and it continues to showcase its legacy even today. It's the most recent titles that are a major highlight when it comes to being able to play as a wizard, and it's actually
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
  </em>
  that features the best wizard abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  allows complete freedom in spellcasting and features 6 magic schools, including destruction, alteration, illusion, conjuration, restoration, and mysticism. Players can fully customize their spells, directly affecting their range, power, or duration, based on varying mana requirements.
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  also features one of the best open worlds to interact with as a wizard playable character, including wizard-exclusive abilities like flying, water walking, and teleportation.

  Players can pick to play as a mage in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  , which is once again synonymous with the standard wizard class. Magic is essential in this game, so, naturally, it's a great choice to play as a wizard playable character. Players can tailor their play styles to be more defensive or offensive based on their preferences surrounding the magic system, but wizards are perhaps the most powerful choice of character type in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fun begins when players hit level 10, where they can then choose a unique wizard path through specialization skills, including knight enchanters, necromancers, or rift mages. Each of these features a unique playstyle which will make one playthrough completely different from another, so players will need to choose wisely based on how they want their wizard playable character to carry out combat. Magic can be used by wizards beyond combat in puzzle areas, unlocking further exploration and closing rifts.

  features an in-depth magic system where playing as a wizard will be an incredibly challenging yet highly rewarding experience. It might seem easy to learn the basics, but it requires some time and dedication to properly master the spellcasting system here. If players manage to do so, however, they're in for one of the best wizard playable character experiences in gaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  There isn't any traditional mana regeneration, and players don't even have access to any magic until they've sacrificed a certain amount of their max health and stamina. It's an immersive system where players aren't simply pressing buttons to cast spells; it aims to capture the whole spellcasting ritual. Once again, there are different magic schools so that players can pick and choose their spells, and wizarding gameplay directly affects the open-world design by illuminating caves with light magic or weather-based protection spells. It's a magic system that works in synergy with the world around the player, making it a perfect choice for wizard playable characters.

  A highly regarded masterpiece,
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  remains one of the best open-world fantasy titles ever made, and it's a great choice to play as a wizard character here. Magic is tied directly to every aspect of the game, from combat to exploration; it's essential for the player. Cooldown times and action points allow for a more seamless experience with magic. Players will still have to manage their spells and abilities, but it's a bit of a more forgiving experience compared to more hardcore mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's not to say it's simple by any means. There are eight magic-based skill trees that players will have to manage and combining these through experimenting can create some of the most powerful and effective spells and abilities in the game. On top of this, spells react not only to the environment but also to each other, allowing for multiple chain reactions and combo building. It's a system that seems simple at first, but players will have an endlessly fun time diving into the intricate mechanics if they choose to play as a wizard playable character.

  It was only a matter of time before the wizard mechanics from
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  became fully integrated into video games, and
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  achieves exactly that to grand effect. Sure,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is a bit of a blurred line between an RPG and an Open-World, but with wizarding mechanics so fledged, it's hard not to give it a pass. Straight off the bat, players can take a deep dive into the character creation and create a compelling and immersive wizard playable character like none other. There's not a lot more that needs to be said about this fantastic title, but it sure is the definitive pick for a wizard playable character.
 </p>
 <p>
  The turn-based combat in the game takes direct inspiration from its tabletop counterpart, meaning players will have
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   to manage their spell slots, items, and abilities strategically
  </span>
  . Players can also utilize the multi-class system to build an even more powerful wizard playable character. It's got one of the most immersive and richly detailed open worlds in gaming, some of the best magic and spellcasting systems, and it's a perfect recreation of virtual
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  . Players should jump at the chance to take on the role of a wizard playable character here.

  Players like RPGs because they can customize their characters even down to the smallest detail, and
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink display-card-hyperlink-no-vignette" data-id="138251" style="; ;">
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </span>
  has a lot to offer when it comes to unique and powerful builds. An overpowered build for a class in a role-playing game is always fun to play and customize, but what exactly makes a character "overpowered" might be a matter of opinion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players have already invented several deadly combinations of race, feat, gear, and weapons to make an overpowered build in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . With the last substantial patch set to drop any day now, there are even more possibilities for fun and exciting class, race, and gear combinations.

   <strong>
    Updated March 25, 2025, by Kristy Ambrose:
   </strong>
   Baldur's Gate 3 is still one of the world's most popular games long after its original launch. Considering how much detail the writers and developers have added to classes, dialogue, and character interactions, the adventure is always different depending on the character that players build. Any of the following BG3 builds, including the latest addition to this list featuring a new Monk subclass, can be further changed or augmented using multi-classing, which can allow players to experiment even further.

   A drawback of any Fighter build is that it doesn't have any healing or spellcasting powers, except the Eldritch Fighter subclass. However, every build using this class has the benefit of Action Surge, which provides the character with a crucial extra Action during combat. Additionally, Second Wind draws on the Constitution score to restore hit points.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Battle Master
  </strong>
  focuses on melee fighting. In addition to some ridiculous bonuses in that category, players can pad them with gear, Background, and Feat choices.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Race:
   </strong>
   The Zariel Tiefling is always a nice start to a melee build, with racial abilities like Searing Smith and Branding Smite. Other decent choices include Orcs, with abilities like Savage Attacks and Relentless Endurance. Humans also have the benefit of the Civil Militia.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:
   </strong>
   Alert, so the character can get the first attack. Any Feat that gives a reaction when it comes to countering enemy attacks is also helpful. These include Mage Slayer and Sentinel. Savage Attacker and Resilient are also ideal for anyone in melee range and ideal for the Battlemaster build.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Gear:
   </strong>
   There is some exceptional heavy armor in the game, and this mostly-melee Fighter build can take advantage of it. The

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There are several spellcasting classes in
  <em>

   High Elves and half-High Elves have access to the Firebolt cantrip, and the Charisma boost is also helpful. Choose a Mephistopheles Tiefling to get access to spells like Burning Hands and Flame Blade.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:
   </strong>
   Elemental Adept is obvious, and the natural choice is fire. Resilient is also a good choice, with a boost to either Charisma or Dexterity. Sentinel ensures this Sorcerer will never be Surprised and will often get the opportunity to take the first turn in battle.

   When playing the game, fans can choose any Ranger subclass for Minsc that they want, but considering he's always in the company of his animal companion, it makes sense that he would be a Beastmaster.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Every Ranger build has some options for animal companions, but this is the one that makes the concept central to their skills and abilities.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Race:
   </strong>
   This versatile class can be virtually any race, but any type of Elf (including Drow) and Humans are ideal because of the melee and ranged weapon skills they have. Dwarves are also a good choice because of the poison and magic resistance along with the Constitution buff.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:
   </strong>
   Alert gives a +5 bonus to Initiative and ensures that neither the Ranger nor his minions can be Surprised. Sentinel gives the Ranger Opportunity Attacks against enemies that target their allies within melee range. Equip the Ranger with a long-ranged melee weapon, like a spear or polearm, to make this Feat even more effective.

For those who want a more melee-based Holy Thor build, the Zariel Tiefling is the best choice. Searing Smith and Branding Smite are powerful racial abilities, and Thaumaturgy is handy for certain dice rolls.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:

   Elemental Adept is perfect for those who want even more boom and bust for their lightning and thunder spells. War Caster,

   which includes the spell Shocking Grasp, is another good choice.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Gear:
   </strong>
   The Blood of Lathander grants the use of Sunbeam, and Ketheric's Warhammer
   <strong>
   </strong>
   does psychic as well as bludgeoning damage. Several maces and hammers in the game work well with this build and remember that a smaller hammer can be combined with a shield for extra AC and bludgeoning damage.

  One of the new subclasses introduced in Patch 8 was the
  <strong>
   Drunken Master
  </strong>
  for the Monk class, and the key to its power is the ability to use an enemy's momentum and energy against them. This Monk is immune to the effects of alcohol, and players can suffer from the Drunk condition. Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution are the three most important ability scores for this class, and this subclass values Dexterity and Constitution the most.

    Race.

   Wood Elves and Drow are good choices with their extra movement and abilities like Darkvision. Other decent choices are the Half-orc, with abilities like Relentless Endurance, or the Gold Dwarf, which has an extra hit point per level.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats.
   </strong>
   Anything that gives the Monk better AC, buffs to Constitution, or more hit points is ideal. The Feats Durable and Resilient help in both factors and Lightly Armored gives the Monk the ability to wear armor—normally Monks can only wear Clothing, like a spellcaster.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Gear.
   </strong>
   The Gloves of Dexterity bring the Monk's most important ability score to 18, and they can be found fairly early in Crèche Y'llek from vendor A'jak'nir Jeera. The Graceful Cloth is a chest piece with the same Dexterity buff, which Lady Esther is selling by the Roseymorne Trail.

   For an overpowered healer or a DPS build, this multiclass can heal, shapeshift, and use several different weapons and armor.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Experimenting with multiclassing is another way to bring a character to that next overpowered level, and a great place to start is the Cleric and Druid combination. Subclasses and Feats may vary, but one of the most powerful subclasses is the Light Domain, and a Druid that combines this with the Circle of the Moon has just created a devastating casting and healing build.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Race:
   </strong>
   High Elves and half-High Elves have a choice of cantrips, which works nicely with a DPS build. Humans can give the class more weapon options, Halflings have the Lucky Feat as one of their racial skills, and Tieflings have better Fire Resistance along with extra casting abilities.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:
   </strong>
   Alert keeps a healer or caster from being surprised and gives them a bonus to Initiative. Durable gives them a handy boost to Constitution for more hit points and better regeneration. Elemental Adept gives a character the ability to cast spells without the danger of a critical miss along with increased resistance to their elemental damage of choice.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Gear:
   </strong>
   Anything that increases Wisdom, which is the most important Ability Score for both of these classes, is the main priority.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Certain subclasses get overlooked just because they don't appear that exciting at first glance or get lost among the other choices.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With choices like Tempest, War, and Life, which are notoriously the most popular Domains among a total of seven, it's easy to forget the power of the Light.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Race:
   </strong>
   A High Elf, or half High-elf, because the Flaming Bolt Cantrip comes with it and complements the light-based build. Other choices with extra firepower include the Asmodeus and Mephistopheles Tieflings.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:
   </strong>
   Elemental Adept: Fire, should players stay with the fire-based build, Spell Sniper will improve their hit chance by +1 and give them one more Cantrip of your choice.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Gear:
   </strong>
   This is mainly a DPS and healing role, any weapons will be more about buffs and extra spells than melee fighting. The Blood of Lathander and Selune's Spear of Night are both ideal choices.

   The whole concept of Wild Magic is a lot of fun when paired with its usual class, the Sorcerer. However, the Barbarian has the weapon and fighting prowess to make this build even more heavy-hitting, entertaining, and random.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It's not just the extra magical abilities that make this build OP, but also the positive buffs that can extend to other party members. Bolstering Magic: Boon is a passive ability that gives allies within range a 1d4 bonus to Ability Checks and Attack Rolls.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Race:
   </strong>
   Zariel Tieflings have some impressive melee abilities, and Half-orcs have an ability called Relentless Endurance that keeps their hit points from hitting zero. Of course, any character with a high Strength score is fine, but keep in mind that this is a melee build, so a race with magical abilities should choose melee-ranged spells.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Feats:

   Get Martial Adept,
   <strong>

  <strong>
   The Yokai
  </strong>
  " is one such quest, providing the player with clues to help locate six "Yokai" around the map. In this guide, we'll show you
  <strong>
   where to find all six Yokai in
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows

  You can begin this quest by speaking to Mamushi at the Hills of Meaning POI, in
  <strong>
   Yamashiro
  </strong>
  . We discovered this quest through a rumor which was learned after helping a NPC in trouble during a random encounter. However, if you know Mamushi's location in Yamashiro, you can visit him at any time to start the quest.

  The primary role of most midfielders is to maintain possession and control the ball, allowing them to distribute it to attackers and set them up in the best possible positions to score. To excel in this,
  <strong>
   Press Proven+
  </strong>
  is essential, offering
  <strong>
   exceptional ball control by keeping the ball close
  </strong>
  to the player’s feet while jogging. This allows the midfielder to assess the situation and make informed decisions, whether it’s delivering a long pass or simply moving the ball forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, this PlayStyle+
  <strong>
   enables players to shield the ball more effectively against strong opponents
  </strong>
  , reducing the risk of losing possession and triggering a counterattack. To do this, simply use the function by pressing L2 (PlayStation) or LT (Xbox) while positioning your body when an opponent attempts to push you to steal the ball. Press Proven can also be
  <strong>
   easily
  </strong>
  <strong>
   combined with other ball control, defensive, or attacking PlayStyles
  </strong>
  to further enhance the midfielder’s performance and suit their playing style.

 <p>
  Passing is crucial for midfielders when it comes to effectively distributing the ball across the field, and
  <strong>
   Incisive Pass+
  </strong>
  is an invaluable option to
  <strong>
   enhance accuracy
  </strong>
  . It also enables players to
  <strong>
   deliver long balls to the forwards
  </strong>
  , setting them up for a one-on-one with the opposing goalkeeper. This PlayStyle+ feature allows players to
  <strong>
   maximize the swerve passes
  </strong>
  , adding
  <strong>
   more curve to their passes
  </strong>
  . By using L2 (PlayStation) or LT (Xbox) while pressing the pass or through ball button, players can achieve a sharper curve, making it harder for opponents to intercept the ball.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another benefit of Incisive Pass+ is that
  <strong>
   precision passes travel at top speed
  </strong>
  , reducing the time it takes for the ball to reach its target. This helps play at a faster pace, confusing the opponent and limiting their time to react to the attack. With Incisive Pass+, you can
  <strong>
   ensure that your passes are perfectly executed
  </strong>
  , whether you’re assisting in an attack or playing out from the back.

  Although its name, Tiki Taka+, might seem to only apply to the playstyle it’s named after, this PlayStyle+ is incredibly useful for players
  <strong>
   who prefer holding the ball in midfield to carefully choose the best pass
  </strong>
  . By enabling more precise first-time ground passes, players can
  <strong>
   avoid turnovers
  </strong>
  and gain a second chance to either
  <strong>
   re-establish their attack or launch a quick counterattack
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, Tiki Taka+
  <strong>
   improves the accuracy of short-distance ground passes
  </strong>
  , allowing players to swiftly switch sides of the field and find openings to attack. However, as its name suggests, this PlayStyle+ does help players who focus on quick, continuous passing, enabling them to maintain possession and break into the opponent’s penalty area using short, precise passes rather than relying on long balls.

  Since the midfield serves as the crucial link between defense and attack, having a
  <strong>
   midfielder who can effectively distribute the ball forward is key
  </strong>
  . A player with this ability can set up strikers or wingers with clear opportunities against the opposing goalkeeper. This PlayStyle+
  <strong>
   enhances Lob Passes and Lofted Through Passes
  </strong>
  , making them
  <strong>
   more accurate, faster, and harder for defenders to intercept
  </strong>
  . It allows midfielders to send long passes over opponents, giving attackers more freedom to break forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  With passes traveling higher and being more difficult to cut off, this PlayStyle+
  <strong>
   enables quick, unexpected attacks, making it harder for opponents to anticipate plays
  </strong>
  . Additionally, it
  <strong>
   improves wing switching
  </strong>
  , ensuring the ball reaches its target without being lost, providing multiple options for both offensive plays and counterattacks.

   strong stamina to maintain their performance throughout the game

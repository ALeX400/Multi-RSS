 <p>
  Although Pinnacle of its Kind is a side quest in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it can only be finished when players are at least level 30. You will get this quest when exploring the Necropolis Halls with Emmrich. The quest sends Rook to different regions to complete some unfinished business and unlock a formidable opponent at the end.

  The tasks are clear and can be pinpointed on the map of Thedas, but the process is time-consuming, as some enemies are rather tough and players might need to complete some quests to gain XP, gold, and unlock inaccessible regions.

 <p>
  To trigger the Pinnacle of its Kind side quest in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , you must complete the Restless Spirits quest. It’s unlocked after adding Emmrich to the team, and it’s also the quest that unlocks Necropolis Halls for exploration.

 <p>
  Upon completing Restless Spirits, you’ll end up in a large hallway with a giant door. Interact with it to speak with The Formless One, a demon, which triggers the Pinnacle of its Kind side quest. Search the room for clues until you investigate a body to the north. The next step is to defeat three demons located in three different regions to unlock the big door.

  Fast-travel to the Nameless Building Beacon located on the northeastern side of Arlathan. Head west towards the tattered bridge in
  <em>

  and cross it to reach a small clearing. Put out the green flame brazier to summon The Formless One, a demon.

  This version of the demon is vulnerable to Necrotic and resistant to Shock, as it uses the latter to attack. Defeat it to earn many rewards, most are similar to the ones previously obtained, like Gold and XP.

  The final form of the Formless One is in Solitude’s Edge, a hidden area located in the southern part of the region that is unlocked by solving the Gaspin Manor puzzle in

  This time, the demon took the form of a fire demon that’s resistant to Fire and vulnerable to Cold. It will keep moving and attack relentlessly, giving you little to no chance to attack. Rook will receive the same-ish rewards for defeating the demon.

  When players return to the giant door after defeating all the demons in Thedas, they have to face the real Formless One demon, who possessed the body of a high dragon. The dragon uses lightning to attack, so it’s
  <strong>
   resistant to Shock but is vulnerable to Necrotic
  </strong>
  . The rest of the elements, like Fire and cold, deal normal damage. To quickly defeat the Formless One, here are some tips:

 <ul>
  <li>
   It is essential to
   <strong>
    bring a healer
   </strong>
   like Bellara or Neve if you didn’t make a certain decision in
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The boss is level 40 but
   <strong>
    can be defeated at level 30
   </strong>
   with a lot of patience and healing.
  </li>
  <li>
   As it is
   <strong>
    vulnerable to Necrotic
   </strong>
   , Emmerich will be a great addition to the party.
  </li>
  <li>
   Wear armor and equipment that has
   <strong>
    high Shock resistance
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Upon filling the stagger meter, the dragon will fall and expose its chest.
   <strong>
    Hit it with the most powerful ability
   </strong>
   or a combo attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   When some of the Formless One’s limbs start glowing,
   <strong>
    attack them as they deal increased damage
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   When the dragon flies up out of range,
   <strong>
    get ready to dodge
   </strong>
   . A circle prompt appears that shrinks when their attack is about to hit, so make sure to dodge at the right second.
  </li>
  <li>
   After the boss lands on the ground, a horde of enemies will start following you. Although it might be annoying, try to defeat them as their ranged attack could be deadly.
  </li>
  <li>
   At some point, the Formless One shoots out a laser beam that can be dodged, but it is better to go behind him and land a few hits while it's busy.
  </li>
 </ul>

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the honor system measures John Marston's reputation and the social acceptability of his action over morality.
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  takes this foundational feature a step further, making the narrative responsive to the protagonist's honor. That said, a former outlaw like John could use high social acceptability to unlock some perks in
  <em>
   Read Dead
  </em>
  .

  When it comes to increasing honor in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , players have to embark on a journey as law-abiding citizens and perform positive actions. This includes activities like saving citizens from harm or assisting the sheriff. Doing so will also cause NPCs to change their demeanor around Marston.

 <p>
  For those wondering,
  <strong>
   donating money at the camp
  </strong>
  is one of the quickest ways to gain honor in the game. In contrast, notorious actions like assaulting lawmen, stealing, and harming animals or innocent citizens should be enough to build up a negative reputation. There are no perks for having a neutral honor, so make sure to increase it or become a Desperado.

 <p>
  Remember that having a bandana in
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  could prevent the increase or decrease of John Martson's honor rating. Hence, remove it during missions or chores to get the complete credit.

 <p>
  Needless to say, you get better gratuities for increasing honor ranks, as opposed to low ratings. For instance, after obtaining the Hero title, a nun will offer the Obscuridad del Santo Andres, a rare item that reduces the enemy's gunshot accuracy.

  John Marston unlocks different perks throughout the
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  ’s campaign, depending on his honor. He doesn’t necessarily require elegant titles, since low social acceptability yields benefits like improved pricing at Thieves' Landing. Here’s a table showing every honor rank in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption

  , along with their perks.

 <p>
  The surprise unveiling of the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Music
  </strong>
  app has given fans the long-awaited chance to stream some of the best video game soundtracks ever made, as well as bespoke playlists. The selection of game music, which the company says it will be adding to in the coming months, spans decades and covers every system from the Famicom all the way to the Switch.

 <p>
  Heavy hitters like
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  are represented, but there are also some esoteric choices thrown in for good measure, such as the music from Nintendo's fondly-remembered Wii console. There's already a lot to choose from, so to make life a little easier, here is a ranked selection of the best soundtracks currently available on the app.

  The game's soundtrack was provided courtesy of legendary composer Hirokazu 'Hip' Tanaka, who also made music for seminal titles like
  <em>
   Super Mario Land
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Metroid,
  </em>
  His tunes complement the cartoonish, frantic action taking place on screen, and although the soundtrack is short, clocking in at only 13 minutes, the prescription is nostalgic chiptune heaven.

  In 1985, video gaming as we know it changed forever with the arrival of
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  ., a game that launched its parent company into the stratosphere, as well as its debut console, the Family Computer (or Famicom, renamed as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside of Japan).

 <p>
  The tunes here have been remixed, reinterpreted, and reinvented by countless listeners in the decades since, but they still have plenty of appeal all these years later. From the unmistakable "Ground BGM" to the waltz of the underwater level, Koji Kondo's compositions are the gold standard for video game earworms.

  Nintendo's Wii broke the video game rulebook in more ways than one; it effortlessly outsold the competition despite being an underpowered competitor, and it used an entirely new type of controller. But it also had an incredible selection of tunes that played while players were browsing the console's different channels.

 <p>
  From the soothing ambient sounds of the Wii Menu to the cutesy theme of Mii Plaza, many of the tunes here are background music in the very best sense and could be played as an aural bed to help listeners relax or focus even when they didn't have a video game in front of them.

  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  raised many eyebrows at the time of its release thanks to its then-cutting-edge graphics and superb platforming action, not to mention reinventing Donkey Kong himself as a protagonist. However, in the time since, it has garnered acclaim for its soundtrack, which is now regarded as one of the very best out there.

  The ultra-catchy "DK Island Swing" will be well-known to fans, but the soundtrack also boasts some other standouts, such as the techno funk of "Funky's Fugue," underwater level's gorgeous theme "Aquatic Ambiance," a tune which would be right at home on any chill-out playlist.

  Mario headed for the stars in

  The tracks here boast plenty of bombasts, from the mighty "Enter The Galaxy" to the climactic "Bowser Battle." There is also room for some softer moments like "Luma" and the gentle, sublime "Rosalina In The Observatory 3," a waltz that feels reminiscent of scenes from
  <em>
   2001: A Space Odyssey.

  The formula that Nintendo hit upon with
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  completely revitalized the Zelda series by putting it in 3D. The new music that came with the game also enchanted listeners, so much so that, nowadays, there are live concerts and lo-fi remixes devoted to music from the game.

  As the opening chords of "Title Theme" bring to mind images of Link racing across Hyrule on horseback, the soundtrack takes the listener on a tour of this incredible game's greatest moments, like the triumphant score that plays as Link travels across Hyrule Field. A wonderful trip down memory lane and a masterclass in-game music.

  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  was a cozy gaming experience that has soothed millions of players since it came out. There's no rush and no stress, just a gorgeous world full of quirky villagers and an ongoing list of things to see, do, collect, and discover. The game's music is the key to this deeply relaxing experience.

  As with the Wii Channels soundtrack, players don't need a video game to get the most out of its audio component. The full experience runs across a mind-boggling 12 hours (there's a "Top Tracks" playlist which shortens things to a more manageable 2 hours) and every facet of life on the island can be found there.

  All these years after its release,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  remains an astounding video game that still can produce goosebumps and offers up a ton of content for players to enjoy. Few games have been able to truly produce an open-world experience that lives up to the name, but the game's playground more than lives up to such a label.

  Much of what made previous
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games work was rethought for this title, including its music. The subtle, understated overworld themes work a charm, as do the more involved pieces like the gorgeous theme for the game's towns, including Hateno Village. There aren't many video game soundtracks that can be described as perfect, but this is one of them.

  During the spotlight hour in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , there will be a big increase of Smoliv in the wild, leaving lots of opportunities for players to catch them and either choose to keep them or transfer them for candies to evolve or power them up. While the event goes on, players will also have a 2x catch bonus for every Pokemon caught during the event - this means players earn extra XP for catching Pokemon during the hour the event is live.

  As mentioned above, the event will run from
  <strong>
   Tuesday, November 12th, 2024, at 6 p.m. local time until 7 p.m. local time
  </strong>
  . Between this time, players will be able to catch Smoliv who is number 0927 in the Pokedex and is a Grass/Normal type. Something interesting about this Pokemon is it gets its name from two words, "Smol" because the Pokemon in its first evolution is tiny, and the olive is the fruit on its head.

 <p>
  Smoliv evolves into Dolliv with just 25 candies, then to Abroliva with only 100 candies. With the event going on, players will be able to earn up the needed candies pretty quickly. Each higher evaluation has benefits but also has weaknesses, especially with it being a grass-type Pokemon opposing Pokemon have a certain advantage. Below are the most effective damage types for Smoliv that can be used against the Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Smoliv comes from the Paldea region and comes with a variety of attacks. However, the best moveset for Smoliv happens to be the combination of
  <strong>
   Tackle (Normal move) and Seed Bomb (Grass Type).
  </strong>
  The reason for this is that it can inflict 5 DPS (Damage Per Second) or combined with a 29.50 TDO (Total Damage Output) in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . However, If the player utilizes Smoliv in Partly Cloudy and Sunny weather, they will expect a damage boost. It is important to know that the maximum combat power that Smoliv has is found to be 965 CP.

  Smoliv does have a Shiny variant, and with the spotlight hour players will have an increased bonus chance at trying to get a Shiny of the Pokemon. The regular Smoliv is a small olive that is green with roots that are darker green and a small olive on top of this Pokemon’s head. The shiny version of this Pokemon is that the body of Smoliv is now yellow with the olive on top of its body now black.

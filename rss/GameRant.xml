   Flashpoint Worlds Collide
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game in which you will fight crime using the superpowers of one of the best DC superheroes, the Flash. The gameplay takes place in a big city, and although it is quite empty, there are always some points of interest in it. Sometimes, you'll need to neutralize thieves, and sometimes you'll be able to take part in a race with other players. Even moving between these events is a lot of fun because you have supersonic speed.

  In most
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, you can easily redeem codes even if you enter the game for the first time. It is important for the authors not to confuse players, so they implement this function in the same way as in other titles. Therefore, experienced players quickly understand how to redeem codes in any game they enter. In
  <em>
   Flashpoint Worlds Collide
  </em>
  , this option is placed directly in the game interface, so even beginners will figure out what's what. However, if you still need a hint, you can simply use our guide below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Open
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   and launch
   <em>
    Flashpoint Worlds Collide
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the block of ten buttons on the left side of the screen. Click the purple Codes button.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the white box, paste a code from the list of working codes and click Redeem.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Remember that codes can quickly expire, so redeem them as soon as possible to get all the rewards.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Odyssey: Why You Should Start Over in 2025</title>

  As Ubisoft gears up to launch the newest addition to the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise discography in
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  , it's only proper to revisit some of the most prominent titles in the series before the new game steals all the headlines. While the ultimate crown of best
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  edition is still debatable,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Odyssey
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the better releases Ubisoft has released in recent years, featuring a rich narrative and intuitive gameplay.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  For starters, despite being over six years old, none of Ubisoft's subsequent big-name additions to the franchise have come close to surpassing
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  's Steam rating. One of the main reasons for that elite status is the full post-launch support
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  had; the game itself has changed considerably since its 2018 launch, meaning players picking it up again in 2025 after a long hiatus might be surprised by the new look of things.

 <p>
  In the build-up to
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  's launch, there was much talk surrounding Ubisoft's shift to an RPG approach in its
  <em>
   AC
  </em>
  games.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Origins
  </em>
  kickstarted the trend in 2017, and
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  confirmed the developer's storytelling transition the following year. While the pivot away from the traditional franchise experience of stealth birthed some dissatisfaction,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  built a reputation as one of the best open-world games at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main reason behind that sentiment was
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  's visual depiction of Ancient Greece. Ubisoft's hours of research into the civilization created a collection of stunning vistas and landscapes dotted with layers of historical depth for players to explore. That natural beauty hasn't changed all these years later, and to further the sense of immersion, players can choose between the Guided and Exploration modes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While waypoints for objectives in the Guided mode are an obvious fan-favorite,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  shines brightest in Exploration, which allows players to discover locations based on hints in the surrounding area. Since it takes about 140 hours to get to 100% completion, chances are players with the Guided mode turned off didn't achieve the coveted badge, and that's as good a reason to get back on
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  as any.
 </p>
 <h3 id="post-launch-support-and-multiple-endings-guarantee-a-variety-of-experiences">
  Post-Launch Support And Multiple Endings Guarantee A Variety Of Experiences
 </h3>
 <p>
  Beyond the visual appeal and depth of lore hidden behind unguided traversal,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  's post-game expansions provide another trove of material to explore. These DLCs were released in the form of episodes, and it took months for the additional content to buff up the base game's offerings. Now that the full package of material is complete, the entirety of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  's narrative is available for exploration, from Legacy of the First Blade to The Fate of Atlantis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ubisoft also included a New Game+ mode a few months after launch, allowing players to restart the game while keeping all their gear from previous playthroughs. This is particularly helpful as
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  prides itself on being a full-fledged RPG with branching dialogue choices and multiple endings. Players’ decisions impact the fate of several characters—particularly the protagonist’s family— and the outcome of several situations, making a timely second playthrough a great way to explore all the storytelling possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a choice of two protagonists, players who experienced the game as Alexios can start over as Kassandra and vice versa. While the story of
  <em>
   AC Odyssey
  </em>
  largely remains the same despite the protagonist chosen, their performances and interactions with love interests and other NPCs bring a different feel to the game. There are also a host of playstyle options that encourage players to switch up their approach on a replay, as the game features a massive skill tree that allows for a variety of builds, from stealth-focus assassins to all-out Warrior-style combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, in terms of the technicals of gameplay, console players who experienced
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  for the first time at 30 FPS on last-gen consoles will stand to benefit more by returning to Ancient Greece in 2025. Ubisoft added a 60 FPS update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, making gameplay smoother and more responsive than ever. Although there were no significant changes to visual fidelity, faster load times and high frame rates make the next-gen replay feel like a new experience.

      <title>Elden Ring: Best Talismans For Bow Users</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  has no shortage of powerful and interesting weaponry, for all different class types and playstyles. Sometimes it's nice to get up and personal with a giant greatsword and sometimes it feels best to chip away at the enemy's health bar from a distance.
 </p>

 <p>
  Bows allow for a unique playstyle that differs in a lot of ways from mage builds and can prove to be an incredibly reliable and deadly way of dispatching targets from far away and even dealing significant damage to bosses. Choosing the right bow is important, but having a matching set of talismans can elevate a bow build to levels even Legolas would be proud of.

  It is also accessible fairly early into a playthrough, involving just a short trek into the hell world that is

 <p>
  A great addition to any Hawk-eye wannabes, the ritual sword talisman comes with an incredibly strong upside and zero drawbacks. The only caveat, of course, is that the player has to be full hp but for bow wielders this is never an issue as harassing from long range keeps harm as far away as possible while maintaining the powerful buff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though not difficult to find, it does involve a bit of progression into the game. Once players reach
  <strong>
   Altus Plateau
  </strong>
  , a sharp left turn leads to the ruins, and down in the dungeon lies the boss. After killing the demi-human, the chest awaits and the talisman is hiding inside.

  A sad end to an otherwise cheery and amusing companion, Alexander grants the player a piece of his flesh as a reward for progressing his tale. The strength comes from using bow skills like mighty shot, giving players a high-damaging long-range option that can be spammed and used to poke or in some cases one-shot enemies from a distance.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the more heartfelt and uplifting quests, Alexander has players running all across the lands between, starting in
  <strong>
   Stormhill
  </strong>
  and culminating in
  <strong>
   Crumbling Farum Azula
  </strong>
  so although the talisman will remain inaccessible until the later portion of the game, it is one worth going for and a great asset when taking on the DLC.

  For when aiming down sights is the way, the sharpshot talisman is a powerful buff that simply involves a bit more precision with each shot. The other benefit is of course the stacking of talismans. Using it in conjunction with the arrow's sting talisman and a few others can multiply the damage output to over 30%.
 </p>

  Reaching this one is a bit tricky, as it requires taking down some difficult DLC encounters and moving far across the

  Sometimes stealth is the way. Shooting from a distance is already a fairly inconspicuous way of battling through the story but having a completely silent character allows for on-the-move action and close-up encounters with a bow that would normally lead to a full-on-guard alert.
 </p>
 <p>
  It takes a bit of work to get to, having to progress a side quest to its midpoint, and is fairly out of the way, so it's understandable if a player misses it. But if stealth is something that appeals, it is one to go for and the questline itself is more than worth playing through, talisman aside,

  Despite being a huge buff to bow builds, it is incredibly easy to get to. For a full guide or the TL;DR, from the Black Knight Garrew tower, go through a gap between the tower and rock wall, hop and, and take two ladders up where a chest containing the talisman awaits.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are encountering a bug that blocks story progress near the end of the game's main quest. While the issue doesn't yet have a firm resolution timeline, the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  development team has acknowledged its existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latest mainline entry in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise hit the market on February 28. The game has already proven to be a big hit that's estimated to have sold in the millions. This early momentum was generated in spite of some
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  player complaints about performance issues and bugs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another such problem came to light in early March 2025, after some fans who had been playing the ARPG diligently over the weekend started reporting an annoying issue with one of the endgame quests. Specifically, the game sometimes won't spawn a key NPC that the player needs to interact with to progress "A World Turned Upside Down" mission in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  Chapter 5-2. The bug effectively blocks story progression and reportedly persists even after restarting the game.

  Capcom's Statement on Monster Hunter Wilds Chapter 5-2 Bug
 </h2>
 <p>
  Capcom acknowledged this issue in a March 2 social media post. The company's statement confirmed that its developers are currently looking into the problem, albeit without committing to a concrete timeline for its resolution. The vagueness of this acknowledgment suggests that Capcom still hasn't determined what's blocking the key NPC from spawning. Many reviewers managed to finish
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  in the run-up to its release, suggesting that the problem was either introduced post-launch or somehow isn't affecting all players.

Identified by version number 1.000.03.00, this patch doesn't address the newly identified story blocker but deals with an unrelated issue causing incessant tutorials to block certain menu options in the Smithy. While this particular problem was PC-specific, the Chapter 5-2 story blocker might also affect console players.

  Capcom's latest game has recently faced some player criticism over a variety of technical problems on PC. The company promptly responded to the widespread reports of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  PC performance issues by offering troubleshooting advice, which agitated some fans who wanted it to admit to poor optimization and firmly commit to rectifying the situation. This controversy didn't stop
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  from achieving fantastic success on PC. The ARPG peaked at over 1.384 million concurrent Steam players on March 1, establishing itself as the platform's fifth most popular game of all time by this metric.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer has commented on whether a loot filter is something Blizzard is considering adding to the game in the future. Because many endgame
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  events and bosses frequently drop tons of loot to sort through, fans have been clamoring for a loot filter to be added since the game's launch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players have never been shy about voicing their concerns to Blizzard about the changes they want to see in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . In each Season of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , Blizzard makes tons of balancing tweaks to the game and makes plenty of quality-of-life changes, so the community just wants its voice to be heard by the developer. To Blizzard's credit, it has done a good job of listening to players and taking action based on feedback, which is why
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is much better now than it was since launch. However, the calls for a loot filter have largely fallen on deaf ears.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a Q&amp;A with Blizzard developers on YouTube, Game Designer Aislyn Hall was asked whether there will ever be a loot filter in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . The answer wasn't a straightforward yes or no, with Hall stating, "The way that we think about loot in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  right now, is that we want you to basically use every part of the animal... When you find loot, when you find Legendaries, even if you don't plan to use them, we want you to be able to salvage them and for that to flow into the economy... We want those drops to be valuable to you regardless of their context or their position. We won't ever say never to a loot filter wholesale."

  Diablo 4 Could Get a Loot Filter in the Future
 </h2>
 <p>
  As shown by Hall's quote,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's resistance to a loot filter so far is less about Blizzard having anything against the idea of the feature, and more about how the developer thinks about loot in the game. It makes sense - making it easier for players to sort loot in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  will undeniably make players skip over worse items more often, unintentionally harming their own economy when they have fewer items to sell and salvage. Even still, the demand for a loot filter among endgame players is so overwhelming, that Blizzard may eventually concede on this particular matter.

  Up next for
  <em>

  is Season 8, which was recently delayed after Blizzard confirmed it needed more time to reach its desired level of quality. Coming on the back of Season 7's Season of Witchcraft, hopefully, it will be another substantial content drop when it lands on April 29. The developer has yet to confirm the theme for the next season, either.

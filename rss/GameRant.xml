  's Version 5.0 Special Program confirmed that a substantial amount of content is arriving with the debut of Natlan, including new characters, weapons, and special rewards to celebrate the game's fourth anniversary. In previous years,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players showed their disapproval of HoYoverse for not providing more generous rewards for annual events like Lantern Rite, summer events, or even the game's anniversary. However, for this year's commemoration,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is giving fans a drastic increase in gifts to begin their Natlan journey on the right foot.

  , during the game's fourth-anniversary event, players can log in daily to freely obtain a total of 10 Intertwined Fates. They will also receive an in-game Thank-You mail with 1,600 Primogems, two Fragile Resins, and other unique rewards. This adds up to a total of 20 free pulls for gamers who want to pull for new Natlan characters. Developers have also announced that starting from Version 5.0 and going forward, players can choose a free
  <em>

  </em>
  5-star character from the Standard Banner on every anniversary. Fans should keep in mind that not all rewards are dropping on the same date, but they can expect to select their free 5-star as soon as the 5.0 update drops on August 28.

  <em>
   Lord
  </em>
  <em>
   of the Rings
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   A Song of Ice and Fire
  </em>
  , and
  <em>

   One of the most popular settings for games are the Middle Ages, when wars were fought with swords, kings were in charge of everyone and everything, and a lone soldier could rise to the very top of society by the strength of arms alone. It’s a fantasy with undeniable appeal, which means the competition in the genre is intense.

  A beautiful action title that took many players by surprise, the decent combat and unique story told in
  <em>
   Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
  </em>
  is one of the best parts of an experience that resonated with a lot of people. The game deals with many mature themes, as Senua deals with her fragile mental state. She battles both her own demons and actual enemies in a game that serves as a self-reflection of her character.

  The sequel to this title promises to elevate the series to bigger and better heights, and fans will be glad to explore this tantalizing world even more.

  It's easy to write off
  <em>
   Dante's Inferno
  </em>
  as nothing more than an uninspired
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  clone. However, this is a reductive way to explain a title that features unique aesthetics and engaging combat. It helps that this title's setting makes it amazing. Dante himself is reimagined as a Templar Knight who must traverse the nine circles of hell to save his wife.

 <p>
  What follows is a brutal and gory adventure that is not for the faint of heart. The setting is just one piece of the puzzle that makes
  <em>
   Dante's Inferno

  such a fascinating game. Players love utilizing a wealth of combos to take out the enemies standing in their way in the most memorable and exciting manner possible.

  It's a shame that
  <em>
   Lionheart
  </em>
  's budget ran out before the game could achieve its grand vision. Shades of brilliance could be seen in the wonderful city of Barcelona and its surrounding areas, but the title fails to capture this excitement after players leave this city to focus on the main plot. As a result, this underrated CRPG has been lost to the sands of time.

  <em>

  's real-time with pause combat and excellent worldbuilding (especially in the earlier stages of the title) make it a great CRPG that more people need to check out. As long as players don't mind the game showing its budgetary constraints in the latter stages, they'll be more than pleased by what this amazing title brings to the table.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tyranny
  </em>
  is one of the most underrated CRPGs ever made. If the game had managed to achieve its full vision, then it's not a stretch to say that this game could've reached the same heights as other legendary games in the genre like
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The exploration of evil in Tyranny is nuanced and engaging, and the medieval fantasy setting adds to the allure of this title. Fans of amazing story-heavy games that don't portray morality in a done-to-death binary form will love what Tyranny brings to the table.

  Piranha Bytes is a studio that has garnered a small but loyal fanbase. Most people cite
  <em>

  Obsidian Entertainment has made some of the greatest RPGs of all time, and fans should thank
  <em>

  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity

  is an excellent CRPG that is a blast to play through and perfect for beginners to get into if they aren't familiar with this classic genre. The role-playing is great, and both the main and side quests are pretty riveting despite a few problems cropping up here and there.

  The HD-2D art style has become incredibly popular for a whole host of reasons, and many people cite
  <strong>
   <em>
    Octopath Traveler
   </em>
  </strong>
  as the game that made this design so popular in the first place. Despite featuring its fair share of issues,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  was a great first attempt for a series that wanted to harken back to the classic era of JRPGs while also featuring some unique additions of its own.

 <p>
  Any complaints that players had about the first
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  title were promptly addressed in the second game, which is considered to be a vastly better experience by many. The main party now actively engages in each story instead of being relegated to the sidelines, which is a simple yet much-needed change that helped players get even more invested in the overarching narrative.

  While the fantasy aspect of
  <strong>
   <em>
    A Plague Tale
   </em>
  </strong>
  is pretty muted, it's still quite prominent and plays a huge role in making the Black Plague setting of the game feel all the more popular and relevant. The first game was an admirable title that focused on stealth and had several nerve-wracking encounters that could be quite a pain to deal with at times.

 <p>
  However, it's the second game that flexed its budget with larger areas and an epic story. While some people felt like the charm of
  <em>
   Innocence
  </em>
  was lost in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Requiem
   </strong>
  </em>
  , there's no denying that this title is infinitely more polished and engaging than its predecessor in many ways. The main story is also quite riveting in its own right, featuring an ending that will shock players to their very core.

  With medieval fantasy having its roots in literature, it makes sense that some
  <strong>
   medieval fantasy games
  </strong>
  are based on book series.
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of those games. While the series has three titles, it is the third title that won gamers over for its open-world map and many quests.

 <p>
  Even non-gamers or book fans are now familiar with
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  as well, ever since the Netflix series came out. For fans of the Netflix series, the game is worth a look. It does take place after the events of the show though, so there will be spoilers for the fate of Ciri, Dandelion, and Yennefer.

  Lately, the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fire Emblem
   </strong>
  </em>
  series has leaned more and more into the medieval fantasy genre. One such recent title is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem: Three Houses
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The game is both an RPG and tactical, with the player controlling their army versus others. The game also incorporates some social simulation elements, such as getting certain characters to warm up to each other and giving out favorite gifts.

 <p>
  The biggest RPG element is choosing between the three houses. Each has a different set of characters and storyline later in the game. The game was released in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.

  This series is famous for its difficulty. Despite the learning curve though, it has gotten quite popular. Due to that, it influenced many games after it. It fits the definition of medieval fantasy in its weapons, armor, and creatures. There are classic medieval fantasy creatures like dragons as well as more original monsters.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  , players shouldn't expect much dialogue, choices, and other characters.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  is more about combat, exploration, and its own gloomy and sinister lore.

  As its title describes,
  <em>
   <strong>
    MediEvil
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game set in medieval times. It certainly has fantasy elements as well because players play an undead knight. The hack and slash series has three titles and a 2019 remake/remaster.

  The protagonist is Dan, also known as Sir Daniel Fortesque. He is brought back to life as an undead skeleton by an evil sorcerer along with an undead army. However, Dan is not loyal to the evil sorcerer and plans to defeat him to earn his place as a true hero that he could not be in life.

  Of course, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elder Scrolls
   </em>
  </strong>
  games are not to be missed. They are very much part of the medieval fantasy genre, complete with monarchs, dragons, and magic. Its latest huge title,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  , has been the talk of the town since its 2011 release and constant remasters since. Even before
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , though, there are still major fans of the older titles like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Morrowind
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Oblivion
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The game has classic medieval races like elves and dwarves but also gets a little creative with cat and lizard people.

  The series has mastered open-world gameplay in the sense that there is always something new to discover, but that does have its sacrifices, such as having deep characters and narrative. Still, many gamers have put over a thousand hours into this game.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate
   </em>
  </strong>
  is basically if
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  was a single-player video game (though it does have multiplayer capabilities). The third title of this series is currently in beta, and fans are very excited about its release. It has come a long way since its first game in 1998.

 <p>
  Due to its use of choices and role-playing, the games are worth playing more than just once. Those who have early access to the most recent title have said a lot of positive things so far, such as the graphics, story, and sound. However, they are still working on the bugs and kinks, so the earlier
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  games may be a better pick for now.

   <em>
    Fable
   </em>
  </strong>
  has several games, with its first coming out in 2004. In every title, players get to explore and make choices in a medieval world. Choices are a little more cut and dry in terms of good and evil than in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games. While the graphics did get better with each game, most fans have agreed that the first title does have the best story.

  Not only do choices influence the world, but they can change the look of the main protagonist. The story also has its share of memorable characters.

  Everyone has heard of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as it has existed since the 80s and has only gotten more popular with time. What makes the series so inviting to new players is that most titles have stand-alone stories that do not require the player to play the other games to understand what is going on.

  Some titles fit more into medieval fantasy than others. For medieval fantasy fans,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Twilight Princess
   </em>
  </strong>
  and/or
  <em>
   <strong>
    Ocarina of Time
   </strong>
  </em>
  are good places to start. While
  <strong>
   <em>
    Breath of the Wild
   </em>
  </strong>
  is their more recent game, it has fewer medieval fantasy elements because Link is mostly exploring nature rather than towns.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the newest title in the series, set to make Zelda herself a playable character and the protagonist for the very first time.

   <em>
    Dragon's Dogma
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes players from small fishing villages to massive castles and gives them plenty of opportunities to enjoy intricate medieval scenery. On top of that, quests will have players hunting on the side and seeking audiences with nobility.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon's Dogma 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes everything that made the original great, slaps on modern graphics, and an incredible Pawn AI system to bring it all together.

  While the new DD2 is everywhere, the original DD is still available for many old consoles, such as the PS3, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and of course, Steam. For computer-based players, it is also available for Windows. For those who enjoy MMOs,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma Online
  </em>
  has also existed since 2015.

   <em>
    Dragon Age

  is a series with a lot of compelling characters and choices. It is an original story with familiar creatures like dragons but also has built rich and unique lore for itself. The game has three major titles, such as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: Origins
   </strong>
   ,
   <strong>
    Dragon Age 2
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: Inquisition
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but it also has its fair share of books and comics.

  For those who like to make their character and make in-game decisions with lasting effects, this is a great series.
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2

  let down a lot of players because they could only play a human character, but the other games have options like elf, dwarf, and qunari. The class the player picks can also influence the story as well, particularly in

  A
  <em>

  fan has created a Fairy-type monkey Pokemon to fit in with the elemental trio of Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour. The new design has intrigued

  Pokemon fan artist EliDwebster has shared their recent work, which they describe as a fourth elemental monkey Pokemon to fit alongside Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour. The Fairy-type monkey Pokemon is called Panroll, which evolves into Simiroll. The base form's name uses clever wordplay, as the "Pan" in its name not only refers to the real-world Chimpanzee genus like the other three, but also the Japanese word for bread, which is also "pan." Meanwhile, Simiroll is a play on "simian" (of or relating to monkeys) and "roll" refers to varieties of bread, like cinnamon rolls. In addition to an artistic representation of what the Pokemon would look like, the fan has also come up with abilities, stats, and an evolution method for the Pokemon.

  Fan-Made Elemental Monkey Pokemon Abilities and Stats

 <p>
  Panroll turns into Simiroll when it's leveled up while holding Sparkling Sugar. The vast majority of Panroll and Simiroll are female, with a 12.5/87.5 male to female ratio. Both Pokemon have the Glutton ability, while their Hidden ability is Sugar Rush, which the artist says doubles the Pokemon's speed and introduces a 10% chance of confusing targets when using Fairy-type moves if either of the Pokemon drop beneath 50% HP. Panroll is supposed to be an add-on to the iconic proverbial "See no evil, hear no evil, do no evil," representing "smell no evil." Like the other elemental monkeys' evolved forms, Simiroll is supposed to represent a "failed" wise monkey, having shifted into a design inspired by delinquent "boss girls" of Japan.

  Pokemon fans have responded enthusiastically to the new designs, with several thinking that they're cute and a good concept. This is in keeping with the artist's other creations over the years. EliDwebster has shared fanart creating new evolutions for existing Pokemon and regional forms that have also appealed to fans of the series.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto

  </strong>
  is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. With this in mind, it should come as no surprise to learn that it's been treated to its fair share of handheld releases over the years, although not all of them have quite hit the mark.

  Given the limitations of the Game Boy Color, Tarantula Games was able to do a surprisingly good job of recreating the world of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  in 8-bit. Unfortunately, that's where the praise must end. The gameplay is quite frankly atrocious, the music is repetitive, and the lack of blood and gore makes the game feel like some cheap knockoff rather than a true handheld version of the first
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game.

  Sadly,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 2
  </em>
  is just more of the same. It looks like a
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game from a distance, but poking around under the hood a little reveals yet another empty husk. It could perhaps be argued that the Game Boy Color version of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 2
  </em>
  was even worse than the first handheld
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  game, but to do so would be like trying to rank a slap in the face and a punch to the gut. They both kinda suck.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Advance
  </em>
  was the first handheld
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game that was actually worth playing, although that's not to say that it didn't still have its fair share of problems. The controls were incredibly frustrating and the soundtrack was pretty bad. Still, the team over at Digital Eclipse deserves credit for their take on the franchise, with their creation at least feeling like a
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  game in spirit.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Advance
  </em>
  was originally intended to be a handheld port of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  . Those plans changed at some point during development, though, with fans ultimately having to wait another seven years before they could play this hugely influential video game on the go. By that point, it was already starting to show its age, and although the definitive edition that arrived some ten years later did help a little in this regard, it can still be a bit of a chore to get through due to its clunky controls and fragile vehicles.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories
  </em>
  was initially released for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. By that point in time, Rockstar had already finished work on the original 3D trilogy, allowing them to pour everything that they'd learned into their new handheld
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game. This resulted in a version of Liberty City that was every bit as good as the one found in
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  and much more fluid gameplay, with the power of the PSP really shining through.

  Released the following year,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories
  </em>
  saw the series once again return to Vice City. The game serves as a prequel to Rockstar's 2002 title, with players this time placed into the shoes of Victor Vance. When it comes to gameplay,
  <em>
   Vice City Stories
  </em>
  isn't all that much better than the previous
  <em>

  spin-off, but beats it by a country mile thanks to its superior setting and story.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars

  is arguably the best
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game that was developed with handheld consoles in mind. It was released for both the Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable in 2009, with mobile versions arriving over the course of the next few years. The game has players controlling Triad member Huang Lee as he attempts to recover a stolen family heirloom, with impressive visuals and fun gameplay making this a must-play for series fans.

  In many ways,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
  </em>
  was the perfect video game sequel. It improved upon pretty much everything that had proven popular in the series' third installment, while also providing players with a far more exciting sandbox in which to cause carnage. The eighties setting and gangster movie-inspired narrative are perfectly executed, while the soundtrack is one of the series' very best.

  Given the long development cycles these days, it's pretty wild to think that the original 3D trilogy was released over the course of just three years.
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
  </em>
  was the culmination of everything that Rockstar had learned throughout that short but productive period, resulting in a highly polished masterpiece that still holds up well today. Thanks to the release of the definitive edition on Switch and mobile devices, it's now also the best handheld
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  game around.

  Weapon mods in

  Farming weapon mods is fairly simple, but there's a bit of nuance involved. Even the best weapons in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  will need an appropriate mod to go with it, but before you go out and stand fighting things, here are some things you'll want to know about farming weapon mods.

  There are two ways to farm weapon mods. The first is to beat
  <em>
   Once Human's
  </em>
  Monolith bosses and use Controllers to open their rewards chests. You will always get at least one weapon mod for opening a chest with a Controller. The problem here is that if you run out of Controllers, you'll have to find a way to get more.

  There are three ways to get Controllers:

 <p>
  Commissions are very easy and straightforward to do. Either visit a local Commissions NPC or summon V by holding Tab and selecting the appropriate button. Speak with them to open the Commissions screen, then pick five tasks that you want to complete. Each task rewards four Controllers each, and if you finish five of them, you get an additional five Controllers.

 <p>
  Certain Public Crisis events reward players with Controllers. To find them, open your map and press X on your keyboard. Then, hover over the event on the map to see if it'll give you any Controllers or not.

  Lastly, you can find Nisa and Severin in settlements and buy Controllers from them. Nisa only accepts Sproutlets as currency, while Severin only takes Stellar Planula. Speaking of Nisa, she also has a selection of top-tier weapon mods for sale. If you want to farm Sproutlets in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  you'll have to farm the Cargo Scramble PvP event.

  The second way to farm weapon mods is to open Weapon and Gear Crates. These have a chance of containing valuable mods, including gold ones if you find them in high-level areas.

 <p>
  You can find Weapon and Gear Crates in the many POIs dotted around the map. If you're clearing an area like Hearst Industries in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , make sure to remember the locations of the crates you find. They will always be there no matter what happens, and you can open them again after four real-life hours.

 <p>
  This isn't as efficient as farming bosses for weapon mods, but it's a good way to get geared up during the early seasonal phases where Hard and Pro mode bosses/dungeons are locked. We advise against farming these activities on Normal mode as the rewards usually aren't worth it, especially considering how limited Controllers can be.

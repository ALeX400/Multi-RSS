  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  player online has noticed an interesting connection between multiplayer and the upcoming Zombies map, Citadelle des Morts. The detail has sparked various
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies theories online as a result.

 <p>
  Citadelle des Morts is the upcoming
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies map in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . The map is set to arrive on December 5, bringing a new Wonder Weapon into the game. Beyond this, little is known of what to expect when Citedelle des Morts drops. Presumably, it will have another complex Easter egg to solve, which is how a lot of the underlying
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies backstory is told nowadays. Hopefully, it also comes with a new special enemy to help keep things feeling fresh on the battlefield.

 <p>
  Redditor Main_Health_1670 noticed that the new Season 1
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  map, Hideout, appears in a picture at the start of the Citadelle des Morts trailer. Comparing the two side by side, it's very clearly Hideout. The user also noticed that around the map, there are various notes with references to Avalon, the city-state where Citadelle des Morts is set. This led many in the thread to ponder about whether this is just a coincidence, or whether it has any real relevance to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies.

 <p>
  In the thread, it was largely agreed that this is more than likely just a classic case of asset reuse. The warehouse from Hideout looks generic enough that it could be from anywhere, and it makes sense to reuse the asset for the photograph rather than spending time and resources making a completely new area. However, the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies story is incredibly complex and has a history of small references meaning something important in the long run, so it's not impossible that the use of Hideout has a hidden meaning not yet understood. With Citedelle des Morts set to release on December 5, it's not long until players find out.

  </strong>
  fans have made skin concepts for Hazard and shared the creative results online. The cast of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is made up of veteran heroes from the first game as well as a new generation of characters that has been introduced throughout the sequel's life cycle. And soon, this list will grow with the arrival of yet another new face.

  Hazard is the new
  <em>

  hero who will be added to the shooter with the arrival of Season 14. Leader of the Phreaks, a group of rebels with whom he formed a deep bond after being helped by them, Hazard is also
  <em>

  </em>
  's new playable tank, offering a new pick for players to take to the front line in matches. The new character is not yet available in Blizzard's shooter, but that hasn't stopped some community members from exercising their imagination and creating cosmetic concepts for him.

 <p>
  Two
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  fans have created impressive skin concepts for Hazard, one turning the hero into Diamondhead from
  <em>
   Ben 10
  </em>
  . Created by Redditor Onframer, the artwork gives the tank the same design as the alien from the popular Cartoon Network animation, with a green body and black and white outfit. Meanwhile, the artist, who has already shared other creative
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  skin concepts, has kept some traits from Hazard's original design; the style of the spikes on his back, the shotgun the hero carries on his right arm, and the scythe he has equipped on his left arm.

 <p>
  The second skin concept was created by Redditor Time_Huckleberry4125, and this time it turns Hazard into a vampire. While the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  fan art retains his weapons and physique, the tank got a makeover with an eye-catching red outfit and a cross on his chest. The comments section noted that the OP's fan art is also reminiscent of a vampire hunter and that the outfit they created strongly reminds of those worn by the Belmont family from the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  Following the end of the testing period that the devs carried out in anticipation of Hazard's release, players are now waiting for his official debut in the hero shooter's fourteenth season. After this,
  <em>

  's roster will increase to 42 playable heroes, with the leader of the Phreaks being the 13th tank to join the game's ranks. Players will soon discover how Hazard will fit into the

  meta and what official cosmetics the hero will get.

      <title>Batman: Arkham Shadow Deserves to Be a Layup for Camouflaj, Not an Alley-Oop for Rocksteady</title>

  It’s difficult to know with certainty anymore whether a game will get a sequel as its commercial performance is often what determines that, even with bigger franchise IPs. Warner Bros. recently stated its gaming priorities, which would presumably be the most lucrative IPs with the highest success rates, and it’s no surprise that this statement acknowledges Batman in particular regarding DC;
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  was likely a low point for DC lately, not unlike how
  <em>
   Marvel’s Avengers
  </em>
  was a low point for Marvel, while
  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Shadow
   </em>
  </strong>
  has turned quite a few heads despite being exclusive to the Meta Quest 3/3S.

  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  is a modern point of re-entry into the Arkhamverse’s beloved continuity long before
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  takes place and could give Rocksteady an opportunity to follow the Meta Quest 3 exclusive with a direct sequel that stars Roger Craig Smith as Batman and returns to the standard third-person perspective. That said, Rocksteady would be better equipped to work on a direct sequel to
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  and start a new chapter in the Arkhamverse while allowing Camouflaj to develop its own direct sequel in the Arkhamverse’s prequel era.

  Camouflaj has been fairly plain lately with how viable the opportunity may be for it to develop its own sequel to
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  and no studio would be more deserving. Indeed, the trail of breadcrumbs
  <em>
   Shadow
  </em>
  lays out already foreshadows a sequel that would presumably feature Poison Ivy’s origin story, at least given how many times Dr. Pamela Isley is referred to with relevance to the game’s narrative events, teasing how imminent her transformation may be in the canon timeline.

     Likewise, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Dr. Jonathan Crane, and District Attorney Harvey Dent are all on the cusp of becoming colorful super-criminals Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, and Two-Face, and it’d be fantastic to see or all of them reprised by Tara Strong, Elijah Wood, and Troy Baker respectively.

  Otherwise, the sequel could take a much-needed break from these iconic characters and, as

  did, emphasize even more lesser-known or underdeveloped antagonists. Regardless, the Arkhamverse is in wholly competent hands at Camouflaj, and a direct sequel taking place not long after

  Because it developed three excellent entries in the Arkhamverse and conceived the franchise’s lore-rich continuity in the first place, it’s only natural to want Rocksteady back at the helm of Batman-led games. It’s odd, though, that a decade ago Rocksteady was believably content to let Gotham City and its Batman smolder to ashes. Rocksteady getting back into the saddle for
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  wasn’t even seen as a willingness for the studio to continue making
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games because of how much the live-service shooter has cleaved itself away from them.

 <p>
  The needless retcons and strange narrative choices it makes include an arguably jarring reinterpretation of Harley Quinn and a complete character swap for Deadshot, both of which Rocksteady poorly explains away.
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  didn’t even keep the Justice League dead and hold to its convictions for the game’s core conceit; introducing a multiverse was always going to muddy the Arkhamverse’s clear waters, but now there are a lot of questions that need answering and Rocksteady’s never been one to divulge all of its narrative loopholes and secrets.

 <p>
  Nonetheless, if Batman is going to become its focus once more due to the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games being as popular as they are, Rocksteady has an obligation to forge a path forward for the Arkhamverse in the present day. A Batman story in the Arkhamverse after he’s been part of the Justice League could be enthralling now that his connections to other corners of the DC mythology are broadened, and it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility anymore to hear voice messages from characters such as Diana Prince or Clark Kent addressed to Bruce Wayne.

      <title>The Last of Us Would Be Remiss Not to Track Ghost of Yotei’s Footprints</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Yotei
   </em>
  </strong>
  was announced at the last State of Play after being one of the only PlayStation first-party studio games to not have any updates in a long spell. The inevitable announcement trailer didn’t disappoint, either, as it introduced a new protagonist, Atsu, in a new locale: the sequel’s eponymous Mount Yotei and its surrounding environs.

 <p>
  Other than featuring a protagonist who assumes a Ghost persona over 300 years after Jin Sakai had, nothing else seems to connect
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , at least from what little has been revealed so far. It’s unclear if this was always the intended direction for the IP, but Sucker Punch choosing to make this transition now for the sequel is remarkably clever and forward-thinking as the
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  franchise can no longer be pigeonholed to a single, stagnant story or protagonist—a storytelling boon that
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  would be wise to take heed of before it’s too late.

  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  may be reinventing the Ghost origin tale and enabling the
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  franchise to become an anthological series that could be feasibly endless depending on how many new protagonists, settings, and eras it would like to spotlight. Jin and Atsu could only be two of countless Ghosts and the franchise would only need to end once Sucker Punch’s creativity for emotional samurai/ronin stories in breathtaking vistas runs dry.

 <p>
  Sucker Punch has probably learned a lot working on
  <em>
   Tsushima
  </em>
  and now gets to rewrite the book on its
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  IP, reworking or adding to
  <em>
   Yotei
  </em>
  everything it wished it had for
  <em>
   Tsushima
  </em>
  . That process can be repeated with each new entry, engrossing players in its gorgeous Japanese settings but telling various stories and inheriting new gameplay mechanics to ensure that every installment has a signature stamp to distinguish them.

 <p>
  Jin was a great protagonist, but holding onto him dearly and forcing development out of him in a sequel could’ve diluted his character arc. Rather, Atsu can be a blank canvas and that’s immediately more enticing with virtually nothing known about her at the moment aside from what weapons she carries.

     Naughty Dog’s biggest storytelling strength has always been its intimate character-driven stories and interactions, and as such it’s no surprise that

 <p>
  It’s both a blessing and a curse that Naughty Dog characters or protagonists are written so well because it begs sequels to give them closure or continue their narratives; Joel dying in
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  is a testament to this, for example, as he has only been around for one other game and yet was adored enough to incite a gross reaction to his murder and the protagonist responsible for committing it. Now, a third game is almost guaranteed to follow Ellie once more and attempt to bookend her story.

  Neil Druckmann confessing that there is “probably one more chapter” left to tell for
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  seems needlessly limiting in a franchise that could tell endless fascinating stories of characters whose suffering and relationships with those around them are poignant against a terrifying post-apocalyptic backdrop.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  doesn’t need to warp its title like
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  is to renew itself.

  Instead, all it needs to do is dedicate installments to stories about other characters and settings without anchoring the series to Joel and Ellie’s exploits. Ironically,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ’ online multiplayer game might’ve finally been the outlet to do that before it was canceled and there’s no promise anymore of additional characters getting their time in the sun during or after
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  .

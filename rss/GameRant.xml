  <strong>
   <em>
    Throne And Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  gives players many different roles to take on. They can man the frontlines to soak up damage and control the aggro as a tank, focus on dropping targets as fast as possible as a DPS, or make sure their allies have everything they need when they need it as a Support. Different support builds will work better in different game modes.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   best Support builds in
   <em>
    Throne And Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  will involve tanking up the Wand and Sword, but the Longbow makes for the second best choice. There are plenty of builds that make use of at least one of these weapons, as well as one build that makes use of both.

  When it comes to the
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    Throne and Liberty
   </em>
   Support builds
  </strong>
  , having a challenging class to play can mean not being there when one’s allies need them the most. As such, beginners are better off with an easier option to play. This class has access to a wide range of features besides the usual healing of allies and providing crowd control. The usage of Daggers grants a lot of escape options when in danger. However, this class has some problem areas that players will need to address if they wish to be effective with it.

 <p>
  The first is how glassy it can be, with it not taking much to put this class into the danger zone. Players will always want to be near allies that can pull the aggro from them and keep them safe. Next, players will rapidly run out of mana, so having the right gear is imperative to help with this. Players' limited mana means that they cannot afford to always be going full throttle, as they may find themselves needing to tap into their mana to make a hasty retreat. This is still an easy class to pick up and start using, so players can practice overcoming these problem areas and be effective Supports for their allies.

  This build will shine best in
  <strong>
   Guild vs. Guild

  events, such as
  <strong>
   Castle Siege
  </strong>

With this build, players will have many tricks up their sleeves that will allow them to adapt to anything the enemy guild may try, like having truly outstanding prowess for both their healing and crowd control.

  This build does not do so well in other game modes and may struggle in many other areas of the game. As such, players who enjoy how this build looks might want to try it out down the line. Realistically, they should start by creating an easier character to learn the game, level up, and then look into this build if they enjoy GvG aspects of the game.

 <p>
  The Warden is a great choice for newcomers thanks to the Sword and Shield Skills it offers. It lets players play as either a tank or a support by changing between different Skill loadouts, but when used together, it creates a great backrow healer. The class is easier to play if the player swaps out the Longbow for the Sword and Shield, but this does come with a cost — it being not as versatile.

 <p>
  Players who take this build in a more tanky direction will find it not as tanky as if they had a Greatsword with them. This makes it a build that is great for exploring different playstyles and having fun. However, once players wish to take things to the next level, they are going to want to find a different weapon pairing.

 <p>
  There are not a lot of Support options out there for
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  , since there are only two weapons suited for the job. The first is the Longbow, and the second is the Wand and Tome. Combining these two weapons together can result in one of the hardest Support builds in the game, but it will bring the most to the table. This build will have everything a support needs to crowd control enemies, heal groups of allies, or pour its healing into a single frontliner.

 <p>
  The Longbow also lets the user use their own life as a resource to get more mana when they need it most. A skilled player with this combo is capable of providing some of the best support in the game. However, its high difficulty to play makes this a class that demands perfection, and newcomers will surely struggle to enjoy this class. Players that struggle with harder classes, might want to consider remapping their keys.

  Looking for the
  <strong>
   best Wand and Tome Builds
  </strong>
  will have
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  players coming across varying playstyles. A lot of Support characters fall into the glassy category, but not Templars. Like Wardens, they make use of the Sword and Shield weapon to grant them an incredible boost to their survivability — this comes at the cost of dealing low amounts of damage in return. This build shines particularly well in Small Scale PvP as opposed to large scale.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1038} -->
 <!-- Zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Players with these two weapons can focus on keeping their allies and themselves always topped up and in the fight. In fact, they do such a good job that they are shining examples of top level Supports as both a PvE and as a PvP build. Players should not try to level up solo with this build; they will want some friends along to help make things go by quickly — with one preferably being a DPS build to speed through dungeons.

  <strong>
   <em>
    New World: Aeternum
   </em>
  </strong>
  has changed how the game works in many way, and some of those changes mean that returning players might have to adapt a lot. But playing solo in Amazon's first original MMORPG is not such a difficult task, with the correct Archetypes and builds, of course.

 <p>
  Here is a rundown on the new starting classes added with the latest expansion of the game, ideal for those who want to enjoy
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  at their own pace without having to deal too much with partying-up and other social mechanics. With the correct build, any player can enjoy most of the content in the game from beginning to end (except certain Dungeons and Raids, of course), and
  <strong>
   for solo players, these are the best Archetypes
  </strong>

  The soldier is a versatile fighter Archetype with access to Sword &amp; Shield and Hatchet, granting it the extra ranged attacks every melee class desperately needs. With access to a lot of powerful tank skills and recovery/life steal from the Hatchet Berserk Skill, this class will surely survive until the endgame without too many issues. Ideal for rookie players, the Soldier doesn't have too many complicated mechanics, and since it has a lot of survivability and damage mitigation, it can even take on swarms of lesser enemies alone.

 <p>
  So, if players want to go solo, this should be the first reliable choice they should make. Plus, it has access to Weaponsmithing, Mining, and Smelting life skills, which guarantee that players will be set on the right path to becoming proficient armorers and blacksmiths, able to create their own gear in no time.

  With a big whooping War Hammer and an even bigger Great Axe, the executioner has come to
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  with the Destroyer Archetype. This powerful and tanky build will guarantee players access to certain abilities that will allow them to fight huge crowds of enemies, potentially farming exp and weapon mastery at incredible speeds. At the same time, the Destroyer is a good choice as a damage mitigation class, being an expert in gaining Fortification and other powerful damage reduction buffs that will negate most damage types.

 <p>
  The Great Axe is a powerful weapon that executes opponents and resets cooldowns, applying mobility buffs to the player. On the other hand, with the powerful CC of the Crowd Crusher War Hammer skill branch, the Destroyer will be able to apply crowd control effects non-stop. The only downside is that players should be careful with their cooldowns, since these weapons have some of the skills with the longest CDs in the game. It also has access to the life skills Armoring, Skinning, and Leatherworking, ideal for creating medium armor that complements the build.

  This Archetype is fast, able to deal incredible amounts of damage in no time, and able to escape just at the right moment. If played well, the Ranger proves to be a good choice for those who want to go hunting in the forests, and with access to the powerful Archery skills from the Bow branches, players will always be at a safe distance from danger. The spear is a great complement to them, especially the Zoner skill branch, which has access to crowd control effects such as Prone, Push, and Deflect.

 <p>
  Overall, this Archetype is among the strongest of them all, and to top it off, it comes with bonuses to Engineering, Logging, and Woodcutting, life skills that guarantee that players can do Fletching and Bowsmithing and never run out of ammo. The only downside would be the Archetype's dependency on ammo, which can be spent in no time if players are not careful. On that note, when that happens, the Ranger can be overwhelmed easily, and that's not good for players who are not accustomed to the game.

  The Mystic is equipped with a powerful curio named "Void Gauntlet," capable of harnessing the powers of the Arcane to damage foes and steal their life force. At the same time, it also comes with the Life Staff, the basic tool for healing in
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  With this combo, players shouldn't be concerned too much about losing their lives, since the Void Gauntlet not only steals life force but mana as well. The Void Gauntlet is a hybrid weapon, having access to some melee skills and some ranged ones, too.

 <p>
  The Staff, on the other hand, has a buff specialization that could greatly complement the Void Gauntlet's powerful sustain, turning the Mystic into a master of life and death. This archetype comes with a bonus to the following life skills: Arcana, Harvesting, and Weaving. Harvesting goes hand in hand with Arcana and Weaving. The first serves as a consumable creation tool, as well as a workshop for developing new Void Gauntlets and Life Staffs, while Weaving will grant access to Robes that the Mystics can equip to complement their build.

  With the ability to switch between Onslaught and Defiance stances, the Greatsword user Swordbearer is capable of dealing huge amounts of damage while also surviving most of the blows it receives thanks to its powerful mitigation. Switching between stances requires a lot of skill, and adjusting the build alongside the Blunderbuss will not be easy for new players, but it will be rewarding in the long run, since this weapon combo is one of the best in the game.

 <p>
  The Swordbearer is the perfect example for the solo player: It can go in and out, deal with lots of enemies at the same time, and has access to life-draining skills and a ranged option with area damage bombing to clear out nests of enemies. This Archetype is easily the best of the best in terms of bruising, and it comes with bonuses to Cooking, Fishing, and Leatherworking. Though they are not the best life skills to complement this build, they are useful anyway. Cooking is especially handy, since it can provide a lot of powerful buffs through the many dishes players can produce.

  Developed by Saber Interactive,
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is a third-person shooter that acts as a direct sequel to the 2011 original made by Relic Entertainment. The latest title has been praised by many for its satisfying combat system, impressive visuals, and accurate representation of the grimdark sci-fi universe crafted by Games Workshop.
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  currently has an overall score of 82 on Metacritic, making it one of 2024's highest-rated games on the review aggregate site, alongside fantasy RPG
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  and roguelike deck builder
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  . Saber Interactive's recent release continues to thrive over a month after its launch, as the shooter has reportedly reached another impressive player milestone.

  would get new armor pieces, specifically the Mark 6 Corvus and Mark 7 Aquila helmets that are still popular among franchise veterans.

  According to Focus Entertainment's year one roadmap for
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  , Season Pass owners will receive cosmetics based on a chosen chapter every season. The first cosmetics were centered on the Ultramarines' successor chapters, while the next season that is set to go live before the end of 2024 will have Dark Angels-themed champion, cosmetic, and weapon skin packs. Focus Entertainment has not revealed the featured chapters for Season 3 and Season 4, which are planned to be released in Winter and Spring 2025, respectively.

 <p>
  The first major update for
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  should come out very soon, Focus Entertainment said in a recent blog post. This will introduce Termination, a new operation that will provide players with the opportunity to fight a monstrous Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan, as well as a new difficulty setting called Lethal. Future free updates will also add more operations, the Neo-Volkite pistol, and a Horde Mode, among other things.

  expansion brings with it a new season, and thus a whole host of class balance changes. As well as adding the new Spiritborn class, which is quickly becoming the new meta, Blizzard has made changes to some underperforming classes, abilities, and gear.

 <p>
  This means there are all kinds of new viable endgame builds to experiment with. It also means that
  <strong>
   the best class argument has been shaken up
  </strong>
  , and any previous class tier lists are going to need a rethink. For those wondering which class to pick first for season 6, these are the best-performing options right now.

  definitely benefited least from the
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  patch, but their primary build options remain similar and are still effective. Leveling is relatively straightforward, but players will need to hit more specific gear requirements and focused builds to challenge the endgame bosses and The Pit.

  have seen some skill adjustments via the DLC patch, with Stone Burst becoming a nice viable ability to main while leveling. Companions have also seen some general buffs in the most recent patches, which makes endgame builds focused on Wolves a strong choice.

  The meta around the
  <strong>
   Barbarian
  </strong>
  hasn't changed much, but its balance of survivability and damage makes it a good choice for newcomers. Using Leap for mobility and Charge for breaking crowd control effects are still strong options in any build, and Berserking is still the best way to augment most Barbarian builds.

   Necromancer

  is a great class for some top-tier builds in season 6. Minions have received several buffs, and a focused minion build is now fully capable of taking on the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  endgame. Un-updated but strong abilities like Blood Lance and Bone Spear remain fully viable, too, and Blood Surge builds remain the best way to quickly climb to Level 50.

  Season 5 led to some incredibly strong
  <strong>
   Rogue
  </strong>
  builds, and that's only been enhanced in season 6. Whether players want to get up close and personal with Flurry or spin-to-win at range with Dance of Knives, the Rogue is a great choice that provides solid damage output, heavy crits, and near-infinite CC.

  <strong>
   Spiritborn
  </strong>
  is the newest class added to
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  and, as one might expect, the class had been balanced towards the game's new difficulty modes and tuned in favor of the players jumping in with
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  . They are a potent starting class that's easy to level without specific gear, and their end-game damage potential is huge. They're currently outpacing all the other classes in terms of viable endgame builds for season 6.

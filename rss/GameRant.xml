  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40,000
   </strong>
  </em>
  is known for its harsh, unforgiving universe. It is a galaxy where everything is lethal to the point where just surviving
  <em>
  </em>
  is a major victory. The worst tends to get brought out in everyone, and even the best of intentions become warped and twisted into doing more harm than good. The
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe can get so dark, it makes other sci-fi worlds look almost utopian by comparison. You know things are bad when
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  looks like a vastly better universe to live in. Between constant warfare, chaos gods, hostile environments, and the seemingly endless swarm of tyranids pouring in from another galaxy, chances of survival are pretty low. Even the major dominating species in the galaxy — such as humans, aeldari, and orks — are constantly struggling to keep themselves afloat. It's hard to imagine anyone having much of a fighting chance.

 <p>
  And yet, science fiction delivers. Sci-fi through the years has introduced audiences to a wide variety of aliens, including many that are unimaginably dangerous in their original contexts. Even the more optimistic franchises like
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  occasionally saw their heroes contend with some truly messed-up creatures. Some of these monsters actually have traits that might just give them a fighting chance at survival if they were to be thrown into the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe — some even possess traits that could cause some very serious problems for the setting's inhabitants.

 <p>
  The daleks from
  <strong>
   Doctor Who
  </strong>
  only understand one objective: EXTERMINATE anything and everything that is not a dalek — and sometimes kill other daleks, too. Unsurprisingly, they are accustomed to constantly being at war with
  <em>
   someone
  </em>
  . A galaxy like
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k's
  </em>
  would probably feel like business as usual to them. In fact, they wouldn't be too far off from some of the factions that already exist in the setting. The Imperium already holds staunch anti-xeno sentiments that encourage a superiority complex at best (outright genocide at worst) — they might even relate to daleks' simplistic beliefs. And, daleks would absolutely love the webway, their experience with time travel and weird anomalies easily giving them an edge in navigating it.

 <p>
  While it may sound funny to imagine classic
  <em>
   Doctor Who
  </em>
  's special effects in the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe, daleks have consistently been portrayed as a force to be reckoned with. A single dalek could probably cut through most Imperial guard units. Space Marines and custodes might have better odds, but even they could be overwhelmed by a sufficiently large fleet. Orks would certainly enjoy fighting them, though their efforts would likely be futile. A few daleks could probably do a lot of damage if deployed to an Aeldari craftworld. The only thing they
  <em>
   might
  </em>
  struggle against are tyranids, though it certainly wouldn't be for lack of trying, and daleks do have the intelligence to come up with more unconventional solutions that might evade other races.

 <p>
  On top of all of that, the times that daleks have been neutralized or 'completely eradicated' in
  <em>
   Doctor Who
  </em>
  , they always have a nasty habit of returning via some convoluted timey wimey or pocket dimension-style methods. All things considered, daleks would be right at home in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k.

  Krogan from
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mass Effect
   </strong>
  </em>
  live for war. They came from a hostile world, even by Earth's standards, and had to adapt to extreme pressures. Even nuking their own planet couldn't wipe them out. They have a reputation for their hot tempers and aggressive personalities, and they reproduce so quickly that the Alliance had to launch a sterility plague just to keep them from overpopulating the galaxy. While something similar to the genophage could theoretically be made in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  , its production would easily be hindered by the inability of other races to work together. That, and most factions would consider total genocide a more practical solution than wasting time and resources on forced sterilization.

  However, the Krogan are pretty resilient, and their natural aggression would make them feel right at home in the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe. They would probably love the orks as a worthy opponent, maybe even an ally on occasion, but they would be ruthless against the Imperium. A typical Krogan's strength might even be enough to win a fight against a Space Marine. And, if their performance against Reaper forces is anything to go on, Krogan would be pretty
  <em>
  </em>
  good at fighting Tyranids. They might even have a shot at defeating them — or at least making them less of a problem.

  Survival would be difficult for predators, but knowing them, they would relish the challenge. In the original 1987 movie, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  was able to decimate a modern special forces unit purely for sport. If predators considered Schwarzenegger a worthy opponent, they would love some of the options available in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  . Space Marines would be an ideal target, and it does not seem hard to imagine a predator keeping a few skulls from them as trophies, though they'd be even more excited about the Custodes (which are about twice the size of Space Marines).

  A predator would probably have a lot of fun battling against crazy ork technology or outwitting the Aeldari. Tyranids would be more difficult, but to a species that puts so much emphasis on sport hunting, that might just make a tyranid trophy all the more appealing. Predators wouldn't become a galactic threat — they're not trying to wipe out entire species — but due to their stealthy hit-and-run tactics, combined with their advanced weaponry, they would likely be able to carve out a deadly niche as stealth hunters, terrorizing
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  's greatest warriors from the shadows.

 <p>
  Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Alien
   </strong>
  </em>
  would become a major influence on a lot of later science fiction, including
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  . But, how well would xenomorphs fare in the world they inspired? The short answer is it would be difficult, but not impossible. Xenomorphs could easily decimate any human occupied-world, especially in large numbers. Sure, even the weakest of
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  's guns would be more than sufficient to kill one, and a well-equipped imperial guard unit might have a chance, but it's not always that simple. After all, xenomorphs like to ambush their prey, so killing one would first require finding it. Even on successfully killing one, there is still the danger of getting splashed by its highly corrosive blood, which could easily take an attacker with it. This would make it at best evenly matched with an average Imperial guard unit, but that is in the case of a
  <em>
   single
  </em>
  individual, like in the original movie.

 <p>
  In a scenario closer to
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  , it would be a whole other story
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  A whole colony could easily overwhelm most imperial units outside
  <em>
   possibly
  </em>
  the Space Marines or Custodes. Even then, a surprise facehugger attack could theoretically
  <em>
   incapacitate
  </em>
  a Space Marine at the very least, though it is hard to say if a chestburster could get through their genetic upgrades. And that's just with regard to humans. There is no reason to think xenomorphs could not also infect aeldari or orks. Xenomorphs have also shown a talent for destroying robots, so even the Necrons might not be completely safe. The only thing that might be a problem for them are the Tyranids, against which their odds would probably be about equal to most other races in the galaxy.

  The titular monster of John Carpenter's
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Thing
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a parasitic alien that infects and then imitates other life forms. There are different ways it can infect a host, ranging from hostile takeovers to gradually transforming the host without their knowledge. Either way, the end result is the same. The Thing completely takes over the host and then assumes their identity, producing a copy indistinguishable from the real thing without even leaving a body. This makes it extraordinarily hard to eradicate, since any effort requires a means of distinguishing who is and isn't infected, and even then, it is still easy for a piece to break off and escape. If that wasn't bad enough, the Thing is also intelligent. It is capable of adapting to its circumstances, learning from its mistakes, and, of course, playing its victims against each other.

 <p>
  The only
  <em>
   remotely
  </em>
  comforting thing about this is it can at least be contained. It's not easy, and the chances of surviving any effort are basically zero, but it can be done — so long as it is in a remote environment with no life forms around and sub-zero temperatures. However, the Thing would absolutely
  <em>
   love
  </em>
  the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000
  </em>
  universe. It would be easy to take advantage of a battle by infecting hosts on both sides while they are distracted fighting each other. All it would need to do to keep going is get one infected host onto a ship. Pretty much every race except Necrons would be in deep trouble. Worse still, the Thing could theoretically infect a tyranid, through which it could eventually reach a hiveship, spread out of the galaxy, and maybe even assimilate the hivemind itself.

 <p>
  The Flood from
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a parasite with a talent for causing destruction while simultaneously being
  <em>
   really
  </em>
  hard to eradicate. This is mainly because, much like orks, it reproduces through airborne spores. It also has the advantage of being intelligent. In the context of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , it has already managed to spread on a galactic scale once, and it got to a point where it was so bad that the only way to stop it was a total purging of all life using the Halo arrays. And, it also came dangerously close to doing it again on multiple occasions. In addition to easily spreading, the Flood also has the advantage of intelligence, which increases with each new host. Given enough time, it can reach a point where it not only understands its enemies, but can take advantage of existing conflicts to further its goals. For instance, being able to recognize that a temporary truce with Master Chief would prevent the arrays from being reactivated.

 <p>
  There would be plenty of races for the flood to choose from. The only ones who might be unaffected are the Necrons (due to their inorganic bodies) and the orks (due to a similar reproduction method). All the Flood would need to do is wait for an opportunity and then strike. Once a proto-gravemind is set up, the Flood could start to exploit existing conflicts to acquire more hosts. In its simplest form, this would mean infecting both sides of a battle and spreading through ships. But, the Flood can also play a longer game. Much like it did with Master Chief in
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  , the Flood could theoretically form temporary alliances to play one side against another to further its own goals or eliminate a potential threat. If it manages to infect tyranids, there is an opportunity to escape the galaxy and upgrade to a cosmic-level threat. The worst part? In this universe, there are no Halo arrays to stop it.

  The series is called
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead Space
   </strong>
  </em>
  for a reason. Turns out it's because outside of Earth, there is a lot of dead space. The reason humans have been unsuccessful in making first contact is because the one alien life form that does exist — Necromorphs — have a habit of exploiting every civilization that has ever evolved with the ultimate goal of consuming them. At their simplest, Necromorphs are grotesque abominations made from twisting and mangling the corpses of other species, and they can be frustrating to deal with
  <em>
   at best
  </em>
  thanks to the way their bodies work. These alone would be a nightmare for any Imperial Guard. Even the orks would have difficulty with these monstrosities. But, of course, at the top is the Brethren Moons — a race of intelligent moon-sized creatures that control everything and have mastered the art of setting traps for intelligent civilizations.

 <p>
  There wouldn't be a lot of war if the Brethren Moons got into the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  universe, mainly because they would know exactly how to prey on all the major races. After all, one cannot fight a war without resources. Throwing a few markers at all the major races would easily attract their attention — and set up what basically amounts to a galactic Trojan Horse that could take out everyone in one go, probably allowing at least four or five moons to be produced at the same time. They might even be able to pull the same trick on the tyranids and, if successful, would have a handy route out of the galaxy. The whole plot of
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  involves Necromorphs basically turning the Milky Way into their own personal farm. Imagine if they could run two galaxies or, even worse, start spreading on a truly cosmic scale.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tekken 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has added the Origin characters from
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  through a series of mods.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  hit the shelves earlier this year and brought a new chapter to the iconic fighting game franchise. With Bandai Namco's title being available for PC, the community has set about creating diverse modifications.

 <p>
  For players with a powerful enough GPU, it's possible to push the limits of the game with an impressive
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  mod that makes the game's graphics go beyond ultra. Those looking for nostalgia can install a mod that adds a series of PS1 skins for Jin, Paul, and Kazuya. The options go further, with mods changing aspects of gameplay, adding customization options such as more hair and make-up options, the iconic Air Jordan 1 sneaker, and making characters like Goku playable.

 <p>
  This time, however, an inventive Redditor called Doctor_Sauce_ has added the Origin characters from
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  through a series of mods. By modifying Reina Mishima's default presets, the modder transforms her into the Githyanki warrior Lae'zel, while Jun Kazama becomes Shadowheart, the half-elf disciple of Lady Shar. By tweaking the presets for Azucena, one of
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  's newcomers, another mod allows players to fight adversaries as the barbarian Karlach.

  For those who prefer to play as one of the boys, one of the
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  mods created by the OP alters Shaheen's presets to add the human warlock Wyll to the game. The mod that turns Claudio into Gale stands out for its clothing physics, with the ambitious human warlock's jacket moving in the wind. Astarion, the High Elf and one of the most popular
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  characters becomes playable by modifying Lee Chaolan's presets. Players wishing to install one or more of the mods created by Doctor_Sauce_ can download them for free from their Nexus Mods profile.

  While the
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  community has a significant variety of mods that PC players can install to spice up the gameplay, this world of possibilities goes even further with the mods that
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  players can install. Some modifications are more eye-catching than others, such as adding real-time combat, creating a custom map, and recreating
  <em>

  </em>
  locations. For those who want an extra challenge, there are mods to make the game more difficult and add a roguelike experience to the Larian Studios title.

  This makes MP management a critical aspect of exploring a dungeon, as quickly clearing waves of enemies for XP will also leave you unprepared for a boss fight. Dungeons don't need to be completed in a single day, though that is often the best use of your time, making MP restoration in a dungeon key. Here are some ways to restore your MP.

  Like in previous
  <em>
   Atlus
  </em>
  games, your MP is
  <strong>
   restored whenever you leave the current dungeon and end the day
  </strong>
  . While that is one method, it is not ideal for those trying to clear dungeons quickly. MP restoration items can be found or purchased, but it is often best to save those for boss fights where you will need more than your entire MP bar in order to make it through the fight.
 </p>

 <p>
  The best way to restore MP in a dungeon is by
  <strong>
   killing or stunning enemies using real-time combat with the mage class thanks to its, "Magic Recovery" skill
  </strong>
  which it starts with. Every enemy killed or stunned using this method will restore a little MP to the entire party and can be farmed as much as you'd like to fully recover your MP bar indefinitely without ever leaving the dungeon. While stunning or killing enemies in real-time combat restores the same amount of MP, it's best to focus on the weak ones you are able to kill. The Mage doesn't deal as much damage as other classes in overworld combat, making stunning stronger enemies a hassle compared to quickly dispatching groups of weaker enemies.

 <p>
  The Archetypes of your party also don't matter, and the weapon used by the protagonist won't change much as long as you are quick to take down the enemies. The
  <strong>
   Mage Archetype is unlocked in the second dungeon
  </strong>
  , meaning all players should have access to the Archetype very early into the game.

  Enemies in a dungeon can be respawned and farmed as many times as needed by
  <strong>
   returning to the entrance of the dungeon and re-entering
  </strong>
  . Before each dungeon, there will be a room where your party waits outside, and you have access to Akedemia, and entering that room will respawn all enemies in the dungeon but not items. Towards the end of most dungeons will also be Plato, who will give you the option to, "leave" the dungeon. This only takes you back to the entrance where you can re-enter and go through the entire dungeon again, but be warned this is a one-way trip. Players can also use an Ariadne's Thread to restore to the entrance of a dungeon at any time.

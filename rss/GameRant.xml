 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has been around for over thirty years. Despite the fact that it has a tendency to reinvent itself with each new entry, the truth is, at this point, fans pretty much know what to expect. One of the hallmarks of the best
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games is epic boss battles that test the player's mettle, and, quite often, the power of the hardware the game was released on.

 <p>
  But not all boss fights are created equally. Give the player too many epic battles to fight through, and it can become a case of diminishing returns. Some of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's best boss battles are much smaller and more personal in scale, like Cloud's and Zack's duels against Sephiroth. That being said, each
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game has at least a handful of
  <strong>
   epic boss battles
  </strong>
  designed to make the player's eyes water.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  features a lot of great boss battles, but for most players, the battles against the monsters known as "Weapons" stand out as the most difficult. Gaia summoned these colossal monsters to protect the lifestream, and they are so big that they can be spotted from the world map, making them some of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's largest bosses.

  There are four Weapons that the player can chase down and kill. Ultimate Weapon can fly and is fought aboard the Highwind, Ruby Weapon can be found in the desert next to the Gold Saucer, Diamond is found marching on Midgar, and Emerald Weapon stalks the ocean floor. Their sheer destructive power is shown off in several FMVs, with Diamond Weapon even managing to shrug off a hit from Midgar's giant Sister Ray cannon. Fighting Diamond and Ultimate looks cool, but it isn't that difficult. Emerald and Ruby, on the other hand, take a ton of preparation (and luck) to beat and will happily wipe out even max-level parties with ease. Even after all these years, the battles against
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's Weapons are still incredibly epic to behold.

 <p>
  This might seem like a bit of a cheat, but Kuja and Nekron are both fought within moments of each other, and they're both epic for similar reasons. In his normal form, Kuja was already one of the best-ever
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  villains. In his trance form, he's just plain epic. Not only is his design really cool, but the boss battle music that accompanies him is awesome. He may not be that big, but he packs some visually impressive attacks, including Flare Star, an upgraded version of Flare. It's these attacks combined with the music that make Kuja's battle feel so impressive. It really feels like the party is fighting for the fate of the planet.

 <p>
  Then, Kuja is defeated, and Necron shows up. The opening to the battle has the entire party wiped out before the player chooses 4 characters to use in the upcoming fight. It's an emotional scene that makes the Necron battle feel even more epic. Necron himself comes out of left field (he's literally never mentioned prior to this fight), but he has an imposing design that makes it clear the player is fighting something godly. The most impressive thing about the battle, though, is Necron's moves. His Grand Cross attack takes the form of a mini FMV and is planetary in scale, while his Neutron Ring move is also pretty impressive.

  One of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  's most memorable boss battles comes surprisingly early on. Towards the end of their mission in Dollet, Squall and his classmates run into Biggs, who activates X-ATM092, also known as Black Widow. This is a giant robotic spider that will chase the party all the way down the mountain and through. After their first battle against X-ATM092, which is unwinnable, the player can either choose to keep running or stand and fight.

 <p>
  X-ATM092 is arguably one of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's most underrated bosses. For an early-game boss, it has a ton of health, and its Ray-Bomb attack is both visually impressive and deadly. When it reaches 20% health, it will go into a self-repair sequence that quickly returns the robot to full health. The player must trigger this sequence five times within the same battle before X-ATM092 can finally be defeated. That's a problem because the whole sequence is timed, and if the countdown reaches zero, it's game over for Squall and co. An impressive design and unique mechanics make X-ATM092 one of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
   's most epic boss battles
  </strong>
  .

  As a current-gen title that pushed the PS5 to its limits, it should come as no surprise that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </strong>
  </em>
  has its fair share of
  <strong>
   epic boss battles
  </strong>
  . One of the most visually impressive is against Bahamut,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's iconic dragon god. A lot of different versions of Bahamut have been seen over the years, but
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  's is easily one of the most powerful. His Zettaflare attack can supposedly destroy an entire planet (an attack that Clive totally tanks somehow).

  One of the best things about this boss battle is the mechanics. The players get to control both Clive and Joshua in their respective Eikon forms, Ifrit and Phoenix. Each form offers a different gameplay experience, but the battle really peaks when they merge and transform into Ifrit Risen. Ifrit Risen and Bahamut battling in space makes for one of the most stunning fights to ever take place in a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game.

  Sin is a giant flying whale-monster that crops up once in a while to make life unpleasant for the people of Spira. A summoner must then go on a pilgrimage, collect all the Aeons (summons), sacrifice themselves to defeat Sin, and begin a period known as the Calm. Near the end of the game, the party decides that Yuna sacrificing herself is a dumb idea, so Tidus suggests they shoot Sin out of the sky using their giant airship instead.

 <p>
  The result is a really epic boss battle that does an excellent job of capturing the sheer scale of Sin. The player must use long-range party members and spellcasters to pelt attacks at Sin while periodically launching rocket barrages at the monster from the airship. It's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  's most unique battle, and it's a lot of fun. However powerful the party members are, they will still look like ants next to Sin. The battle ends with the party flying into the monster's mouth, where a recreation of Zanarkand can be found.

  Most boss battles task the player with fighting either one single enemy or, at most, one boss backed up by a handful of minions. The final fight in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core
   </em>
  </strong>
  , however, has Zack facing off against Shinra's entire army. In gameplay terms, that means fighting endlessly respawning Shinra grunts while several attack helicopters fire HP-decimating homing missiles at Zack from afar.

 <p>
  As the fight drags on, and both the player and Zack become increasingly exhausted, the battle starts to feel like an interactive cutscene. A badly injured Zack can barely move, and the DMV slots (which the player would usually use to get out of a tough spot) begin to bug out. It doesn't matter how over-leveled Zack is or how good the player is; this is simply a boss battle battle that they can't win. The result is one of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's best endings.

  is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to epic boss battles. There's the battle where Noctis fights the giant serpent Leviathan while flying over the flooded city of Altissia, the battle where he fights the skyscraper-sized Titan, and the battle where he and friends kill an adamantoise that's been pretending to be a mountain the entire game. The most epic battle, however, is arguably the final fight against Ardyn.

 <p>
  Fought after exploring Insomnia, the Ardyn fight gets off to a slow start. Noctis and Ardyn start off by slugging it out in the streets of Insomnia. Ardyn is fast and has some cool royal arms and martial arts attacks, but it's nothing overly impressive. Once Ardyn is defeated in this stage, however, the real fight begins. The villain heals himself and flies into the skies above Insomnia. In a battle that looks like it's straight out of a shonen anime, Noctis and Ardyn fly through the skies shooting at each other with vastly upgraded Armiger attacks. It's a flashy fight, and things move so fast that it can be hard to keep track of what's going on. Do enough damage, however, and Ardyn will land, sparking a third, short phase of the fight that ends with Noctis finishing Ardyn off with the royal arms.

  ends with a series of escalating boss battles in the Northern Cave. Straight after defeating Jenova-Synthesis and Bizarro-Sephiroth, the party runs into Sephiroth's ultimate form, Safer-Sephiroth. It might have a weird name, but this form comes with a nice angelic look and a terrifying arsenal of attacks. The setting, an endless void at the end of the world, is also suitably epic.

  This is one of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's hardest boss fights. Most of his attacks hit like a train and cause nasty status effects. His most impressive attack (and another reason why this battle is so epic) is Super Nova. This incredibly lengthy attack has Sephiroth summoning a massive comet from outside the Milky Way that destroys most of the Solar System's planets before smashing into the party. A boss who can wipe out most of the solar system with a single attack more than deserves to be referred to as "epic."

  's final fight against Kefka is proof that fancy 3D graphics aren't needed for a boss battle to be epic. Beating an evil clown may not sound particularly epic (unless one has coulrophobia), but the battle against Kefka isn't one quickly forgotten.

  For a start, it's not easy reaching him, as the party first has to ascend the Statue of the Gods. By the time they reach Kefka, he has used his endless hatred for all life to turn himself into the God of Magic. That means he's now much bigger in stature and resembles an ancient Greek god, packing both angel and demon wings. The sprite work is amazingly detailed and pushes the limits of the art style. His attacks are also impressively rendered, with Forsaken, his ultimate move, being particularly well-animated. The coolest part of the battle, though, is the musical theme that plays throughout it, "Dancing Mad," which really ups the tempo, making the battle feel even more tense.

  One of the great aspects of "The Iron Rig" is designed to be available to both old and new players as soon as they load the game. And like many of the quests in the base game, there is very little information provided to the player as to where they should start.
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  relies heavily on atmosphere to tell its story, and guide its players. Because of this, returning players will have a sight advantage due to the fact they will quickly notice two new elements:

   <strong>
    Oil Rig:
   </strong>
   From the moment you are set free in The Wallows, you will likely notice a massive yellow oil rig off in the distance.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Floating Crates:
   </strong>
   Players will encounter missing cargo scattered all throughout the game world. New players will likely see these crates and assume they are simply random items that can be sold to the Trader. Reading the item description, however, will reveal that the crates are the property of the
   <strong>
    Ironhaven Corporation
   </strong>
   . It is noted that the owner of these crates can be found at
   <strong>
    J-15
   </strong>
   on the map.

  Once you have collected at least two crates, you can now head to the oil rig that gives the DLC its name. Just as it says on the crates, you'll find the rig at J-15 on the map. This sits between the northern edges of
  <strong>
   Twisted Strand
  </strong>
  and the
  <strong>
   Devil's Spine.
  </strong>
  Be careful as you make your way to the rig, as there is a fair amount of open ocean surrounding it. It is slightly closer to the Twisted Strand, so consider using that as an outpost if you need to seek shelter and rest for the night.

 <p>
  Once you dock at the Iron Rig, you'll be introduced to the
  <strong>
   Foreman
  </strong>
  . If you already have two crates, you'll be able to fulfill the first task and complete the
  <strong>
   Base of Operations
  </strong>
  . This will open up the Iron Rig questline in earnest.

  When you first begin playing
  <em>
   Dredge,
  </em>
  you will likely come across floating crates as you make your way through the early quests. However, if you are returning to the game having already completed the main quests, you'll want to head to the Iron Rig straight away. Speaking to the Foreman will reveal several new markers on your map. These are the last known locations of the ships that were carrying the supplies. New players can also take advantage of this if they want to get into "The Iron Rig" right away.

 <p>
  Similar to the previous installments in the franchise,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  comes packed with a ton of Easter eggs. One of them pays homage to the Ghost AI from
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  that was originally voiced by Peter Dinklage before being replaced by Nolan North. The reference, however, does not only exist in name alone. It is also a source of obtaining Loot-O-Grams, a tradeable currency that can be redeemed for legendary weapons and items. Chances are that you have already obtained a Loot-O-Gram by playing the main campaign. If you are now wondering how to get more, keep reading.

  Unlike other items that are part of the world loot pool,
  <strong>
   Loot-O-Grams only drop from a single mini-boss called Dinklebot
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  . It cannot drop from any other enemy or dedicated loot source such as chests, slot machines, vending machines, Maurice's black market, challenges, etc.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Dinklebot can be found in the northeastern corner of Skywell-27 on Promethea

  . The zone has only one fast-travel point in the south. You will have to make your way north from there, as shown in the map above.

  When you reach the designated location, Dinklebot will spawn from the trash pile in front of the large truck. The mini-boss poses little threat and does not require your vault hunter to have an overpowered build in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . However, you will need enough damage to destroy his powerful shield, which constantly regenerates. Make sure to destroy the mines first before targeting the bots. This will give you room to move around in for the fight.

     . Now, though, the mini-boss is a guaranteed spawn with a guaranteed loot drop. You can return to the same location after a while, or quit and load back, to farm Dinklebot for more Loot-O-Grams in

  Loot-O-Grams look similar to Eridium Shards, so Crazy Earl will be more than happy to take them off your hands. When you have farmed enough Loot-O-Grams in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , return to Sanctuary III to visit him. Crazy Earl can be found near Ellie at the bottom of the ship. He will give you a random item of random rarity for every Loot-O-Gram traded.

    <p>
     Each Loot-O-Gram has a 50 percent chance of spitting a random common (green) item. Hence, the more Loot-O-Grams you trade with Crazy Earl, the higher your chances of getting a legendary item. Remember this loot-farming tip in
     <em>
      BL3
     </em>
     , because new players often waste their chances by redeeming only a few Loot-O-Grams or Eridium Shards for that matter.

   <strong>
    Diablo 4's
   </strong>
  </em>
  newly reworked Legendary Aspect Splintering Energy has made the Lightning Spear Sorcerer viable just in time for Season 5. Players can now fight the Infernal Hordes with this blast of a build and watch enemies explode under the power of their Critical Hits. However, the build is item dependent and finicky, meaning it's tough to get right without a guide.

 <p>
  The Lightning Spear Sorcerer is now viable in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  due to the rework of the
  <strong>
   Splintering Energy Aspect
  </strong>
  . This aspect greatly increases the ratio of total damage value (shown on the stats bar) done by each Lightning Spear from 16% to 85-110%. As a result, the Lightning Spear ability can easily carry the build's late game damage — provided it is off of cooldown frequently enough. As a bonus, the ability
  <strong>
   requires nearly no Mana to cast
  </strong>
  , making generation a low priority. However, players will want to use a different leveling build, such as the Chain Lightning Leveling Sorcerer.

  The Lightning Spear Sorcerer's Skill tree is quite bizarre, in that points are frequently invested into abilities that won't be on the Hotbar — this is because of Enchantment Slot priority and the need to buff various abilities that
  <strong>
   Unstable Currents
  </strong>
  will cast.

   The Sorcerer Enchantments

  of this build, surprisingly, don't include any of the abilities found on the Hotbar. Instead, one slot is invested into the basic ability
  <strong>
   Firebolt
  </strong>
  , and the other is given to
  <strong>
   Ice Blades
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Firebolt is chosen as an enchantment because it applies burning to enemies directly damaged by the player. This will produce DoT effects on many enemies while Lightning Spear bounces around, or Frozen Orb goes off, which will in turn activate the Critical Strike Chance buff from
  <strong>
   Devouring Blaze
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  On the flip side, Ice Blades' enchantment effect automatically spawns the ability for
  <strong>
   each 40 seconds of cooldowns
  </strong>
  expended by the player. Due to this build's heavy cooldown focus, this will happen quite frequently, resulting in many Ice Blades being active during extended combat encounters. This is excellent news, because the ability has been upgraded with Summoned Ice Blades, meaning it will reduce the cooldown of all abilities each time Ice Blades hit a Vulnerable enemy.

      <title>5 Open World Games Worth Playing Just For Their Weapons</title>

 <p>
  Open-world games offer an incredible array of things to do, like exploring deep worldbuilding, defeating powerful bosses, uncovering lost secrets, and finding
  <strong>
   powerful weapons
  </strong>
  to destroy hordes of enemies. Some belong to the fantasy genre, while others typically fall into sci-fi and action settings. But, most of them have a combat system that includes many great weapons to try.

 <p>
  From a sword crafted for a chosen one to a trash-spitting machine gun cannon that allows players to kill monsters using junk, these weapons make their open-world games must-plays for anyone who loves compelling weaponry that simply feels magical to wield.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon's Dogma 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has done a lot of work to improve its predecessor's already great qualities, especially regarding its combat and weapon systems. The result is impeccable, and every player that dives into the lands of Vermund and Battahl soon come across a great deal of fantastical weaponry — alongside devastating Vocation skills — to wield against all manner of monsters. The Magick Archer's magick bow especially feels incredible, delivering spectacular barrages of arcane destruction.

  Later in the adventure, players will come across the Dragonforged, a mysterious former Arisen from another world, who will provide them with Dragon Forged weapons: the finest instruments of death they'll be able to find in this game. Capcom has done great work creating hundreds of equipment pieces for players to try the best compositions, but these are the best of the best — and plus, they look awesome. Totally worth playing just to get one of those and slay dragons like a boss.

  When talking about the greatest weapons ever crafted in an open-world game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fable: The Lost Chapters
   </em>
  </strong>
  has loads of them. From warhammers to longbows, there are many legendary weapons ready to be picked by chosen heroes (or heinous villains) and used in their quest for power. From the Singing Blade to the powerful Avo's Tear, all of
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  's weapons are worthy of legend — and they have their own distinct lore as well.

 <p>
  All these incredibly well-designed weapons could probably make a return in the upcoming
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  game. The reboot of the franchise is set to hit the stores at an undisclosed date in 2025, so players will have to wait some time until we know for sure if the game is going to keep on the tradition of creating the coolest weapons.

  For players who always dreamed of swinging a Viking axe,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Valhalla
   </strong>
  </em>
  has what they need to scratch that itch. From its incredibly well-designed combat animations to its flexible battle system that allows you to wield even two halberds. Valhalla is as brutal as it is fun to play, and the best thing is that you have hundreds of weapons to loot and plunder.

 <p>
  Even the legendary Thor's Hammer can be acquired at some point in the game, and it comes with a number of mythical qualities. But, perhaps what's more appealing about wielding those legendary weapons is how well they combine with the armor that Eivor gets to wear as he ravages the British lands, searching for answers — and loot, of course.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the pinnacle of the looter shooter franchise, with hundreds of weapons at the players' disposal and dozens of locations to plunder as you seek out the craziest weapons the galaxy has ever seen — from a mucus shooter that spits clouds of acid and melts your opponents into a pool of green goo, to a rocket launcher machine gun that can mow down even the heaviest of foes in a matter of seconds.

 <p>
  But, the other great thing about the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  franchise is that every weapon manufacturer has its own characteristics and lore, and that is awesome. Maliwan deals in elemental weapons, mostly SMGs and rapid-fire blasters. Torgue manufactures shotguns, explosive weapons, and ordnance. Vladoff deals with classic weapons such as automatic rifles and gatling guns. Dahl prioritizes precision weapons and accuracy. The Atlas brand is synonymous with firepower and reliability, with the repeater pistol being its flagship product. Jakobs creates classic Western-style weapons, such as revolvers and action lever rifles. And then there's Hyperion, who focuses on high-tech weapons that crush energy shields. Of course, there are also Eridian weapons, crafted by the ancient civilization, and those are as unpredictable as they are powerful — every Vault Hunter's dream.

  The
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series' signature gimmick is that of its wacky and dystopian weapons that integrate seamlessly with its worldbuilding and scenario design. Players walking the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  wastelands might find a lot of incredible tools of destruction, from makeshift tube rifles to the almighty Fat-Man, which launches mini Nukes at unsuspecting enemies from afar. Careful though, as some of these weapons are not infallible and can turn against you — especially those powered by nuclear ammunition.

  Perhaps the most curious and fun-to-play weapon of all
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
   's
  </em>
  arsenal is the Junk Jet, an aberration made by a crazy scientist who was addicted to so many substances that his HR department had a hard time trying to write down the list. Ultimately, this curious machine falls in the hands of the Vault Dweller, and can propel every piece of junk you find in the Wastelands as powerful cannonballs that can obliterate even the strongest of Supermutants. It is absolutely mind-boggling to see the arm of a doll crushing the skull of a Yaoguai, or a Basketball knocking down a cannibal Raider. The wonders of science!

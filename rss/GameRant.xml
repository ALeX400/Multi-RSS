  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    EA Sports FC 25
   </em>
  </strong>
  bug is allowing players to bypass the set piece distance threshold and simply block the shots of their opponents. For players wondering how they can exploit this
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  glitch, here is what they need to know.

     It is highly discouraged to exploit this bug in PvP mode, as it is technically against the rules of football and is an unethical way of gaining an advantage over opponents.

 <p>
  In soccer, there is a distance opponent players need to maintain when a set piece, which includes corner kicks, free kicks, goal kicks, and penalties, is being taken. This distance is a circle of radius of 10 yards or 9.15m, and it is usually denoted by the referee. In
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  , there is an invisible barrier that enforces this rule. So when an opponent is taking a set piece, a player will not be able to get closer than 10 yards from the opponent.

 <p>
  Due to a glitch, players can bypass this invisible barrier in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . To do that, players will first need to start running towards the opponent who is taking the set piece. Right
  <strong>
   before they are about to cross the invisible barrier, they will need to press the R1 button (RB on Xbox) on their controller
  </strong>
  . This will allow them to bypass the barrier altogether, and they will be able to get as close as they want to the opponent. It is crucial to note that players should press the key before they cross the invisible barrier, or else this trick will not work at all. Once again, players should avoid using it in PvP mode, especially competitive modes in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  like Ultimate Team.

 <h3 id="the-player-39-s-direction">
  The Player's Direction
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another thing to note is that once players start exploiting this glitch, they will not be able to change the direction of their player. That is, the player will keep running in the same direction as they were before entering the barrier. Therefore, one should position the player in the right direction toward the opponent before crossing the barrier. The best way to use this glitch is to go directly in front of the opponent who is taking the set piece, as it will simply block their shots altogether. In fact, this also works for goal kicks, so one can use it as an offensive tactic in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  as well. That being said, considering this is pretty much a game-breaking bug, it is quite likely that the developers will fix it pretty soon.

  Coming from a loot goblin, looting is essential in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . Looting enemies is a quick and efficient way to acquire valuable items and collectibles without having to search for hours or spend a big buck.

 <p>
  From weapons and ammunition to money and resources, there's always something to be gained from fallen foes. Remember, looted items can be sold for money or used to craft essential items, saving players time and resources in the long run. Make it a habit to search every enemy encountered, and players will be well-equipped for traveling the land.

  that allows players to slow down time and target enemies with deadly accuracy. Mastering Dead Eye is essential for success in combat and can help players overcome any challenging situation.

 <p>
  By practicing early on in the game and experimenting with different aiming techniques, players can become proficient in using Dead Eye to their advantage, whether it's taking out multiple enemies at once or catching a 3-star animal kill. Practice using Dead Eye in these different scenarios, experiment with different aiming techniques and pound out multiple shots in Dead Eye to maximize effectiveness while using it. With enough practice, players will become masters of Dead Eye and a formidable force on the frontier, fast.

  A new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  bug is making it impossible for players to catch Dynamax Falinks, as the screen turns white after the raid, and there is no option to catch it at all. Dynamax Falinks debuted as part of three-star Max Battles on October 1st in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , but it seems like players will need to wait until the bug is fixed to catch the Pokemon.

 <p>
  The debut of the Dynamax feature in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has been a bumpy ride so far. While fans were quite excited to see the arrival of a new mechanic, several issues came along with it. For instance, players were frustrated with
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  crashing during Beldum Max Raids, and the cost of the battle made things even worse. Meanwhile, a new set of Max Raids recently debuted in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , and it seems like they are bug-ridden as well.

 <p>
  In a new post on the Silph Road subreddit, user Kiwi1234567 highlights a frustrating bug that players have been facing in Max Battles in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Apparently, when players try to catch a Dynamax Falinks after defeating it in a raid, the screen turns completely white. It should be noted that players do get the rewards for the battle, and the raid is counted as completed; however, the catch screen does not seem to be working in the game at this time.

 <p>
  What makes things worse is the fact that Max Particles are still consumed for the battle, despite players being unable to catch the Pokemon. Fans noted that they downloaded the latest update and assets, which Niantic had earlier notified about, but that doesn't seem to fix the issue. Additionally, players have noted that almost all
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Power Spots have turned into Falinks Max Raids, and there is no sight of the Galar starters, namely Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble, at all. Considering that all Falinks Max Raids are bugged right now, it seems like players should avoid Dynamax Raids altogether for the time being. Fans are not happy with the current state of the game, but they are expecting that a fix will be rolled out soon.

 <p>
  As far as the Falinks Raid itself goes, players will need to go all out in the battle, as it is reportedly much harder than the Beldum Max Raid in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . So far, the go-to strategy seems to be using Dynamax Charizard in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  for the Falinks Raid, as it appears to be much more effective than Dynamax Metagross. Until the Max Raids are fixed, players can focus on leveling up their Max Moves, as they play a crucial role in the battle.

  At the time of writing, PlayStation Network services are down for nearly everything, including account management, gaming, social activities, as well as the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Video. According to notices on the official site, Sony is aware of the issue and is looking into a fix, but the problem has yet to be resolved. Players are voicing frustration all over the internet as the network dropped out in what's gaming primetime for many fans.

 <p>
  Further adding to this frustration is the fact that many single-player games can't be played when the PlayStation Network drops out, even if a player has no intention of using online features for the game. This has become more commonplace in gaming in general, with some PC and Xbox gamers also going through similar problems when their internet goes out, there's a network outage, or DRM-enabled games can't reach their authentication services to ensure that the copy of the game being played is legitimate. In any of these cases, being faced with the notion of not being able to game due to an outage outside fans' control can be extremely irritating.

 <p>
  For now, all PlayStation fans can really do is wait for Sony to issue a fix and get things running again. While some outages in the past have lasted for days, the majority of the time this happens, things get back up and running in a matter of hours. With a little luck, Sony fans will be back online and enjoying their favorite games shortly. In the meantime, it might be time to boot up an older console or try one of a number of games that don't require active wi-fi to play. While many gamers now have additional devices to game on, whether it's a phone, Nintendo Switch, PC, or another device, this outage may nonetheless throw a wrench in some fans' evenings.

  Lingsha's best light cone options are crucial for optimizing her performance as a Fire Abundance unit in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Players may find her to be quite similar to Gallagher at first glance due to the shared path and element, as well as focus on Break Effect - however there are quite some nuances. Generally, her kit benefits significantly from enhancements to Break Effect, ATK, and Energy Regeneration, allowing her to fulfill both healing and offensive support roles within a team. Players will find a variety of premium light cones that align perfectly with her abilities, but there are also plenty of F2P-friendly options that can provide solid alternatives for those working with limited resources.

  While Lingsha's current selection of light cones offers a variety of ways to enhance her role, players should keep an eye on future (event-limited) light cones that might bring even more utility. Whether players are looking to prioritize healing, Break Effect, or energy generation, here are the best light cone options for Lingsha that ensures there’s something to suit different needs.

 <p>
  Energy Regeneration is a crucial stat for Lingsha, as her Ultimate is one of the most vital aspects of her kit. A max superimposed version of
  <strong>
   Post-Op Conversation
  </strong>
  can significantly enhance her ability to consistently activate her Ultimate, by increasing her Energy Regeneration Rate further thereby boosting both her offensive support and healing capabilities.

 <p>
  This is especially important in Break Damage team compositions, where increased activation frequency allows for a damage increase for Break DMG, and it also proves beneficial in Acheron teams, as her Ultimate applies a debuff to enemies. Additionally, teams featuring Feixiao can gain from frequent Ultimate activations, as Fuyuan's actions are advanced, helping her accumulate stacks more quickly. Given these considerations, while Lingsha has access to several viable 4-star Gacha light cone options, Post-Op Conversation stands out as the most beneficial choice for her in this bracket.

  While
  <strong>
   Night of Fright
  </strong>
  is primarily recognized as Huohuo's signature light cone, its ability to buff allies, provide consistent healing, and increase Lingsha's Energy Regeneration Rate makes it a solid choice for her as well. However, it may not be as optimal as other premium Abundance light cones on the list that offer more direct synergy with Lingsha’s kit.

     Although What is Real is ranked higher than Night of Fright, if players achieve around 200% Break Effect without the need for a dedicated light cone with Break Effect, Night of Fright can actually surpass it in effectiveness due to its additional party-wide buff utility.

  If players need extra Break Effect on Lingsha to activate her bonus ability or to surpass the necessary Break Effect for a dedicated team,
  <strong>
   What is Real?
  </strong>
  serves as an excellent option, especially as her best F2P light cone. Unfortunately, its utility is somewhat limited, as the secondary passive effect that restores HP only applies to the wearer. While this can enhance Lingsha's own survivability, it isn't particularly impactful since she rarely utilizes her Basic attacks, and it does not provide any benefits to her teammates including passive healing.

  Lingsha can effectively utilize Luocha's light cone,
  <strong>
   Echoes of the Coffin
  </strong>
  , which has often been considered niche due to the limited number of healers in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  that scale with ATK%. However, since Lingsha benefits from ATK%, this light cone becomes a valuable asset for her. The additional effects are also quite advantageous, as each hit she delivers allows her to regenerate energy, enhancing her overall performance.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":990} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Moreover, when she activates her Ultimate, all allies gain a boost in Speed, which can be especially helpful in turn-limited combat encounters. Overall, Echoes of the Coffin provides substantial healing potential for Lingsha, even surpassing that of her signature light cone, making it one of her top choices—particularly for players who may not find Luocha as essential in their team compositions anymore.

       Increases the wearer's Break Effect by 60%. After the wearer uses Ultimate to attack enemy targets, inflicts the targets with the "Woefree" state, lasting for 2 turn(s). While in "Woefree," enemy targets take 10% increased DMG. The effect of increasing DMG taken is additionally boosted by 8% if the wearer's current Break Effect is 150% or higher.

 <p>
  Interestingly, while "Scent Alone Stays True" is Lingsha's signature light cone and her best option due to the significant Break Effect buff it provides, along with a debuff that increases the damage enemies take, its utility can vary across different team compositions. This makes it somewhat niche, and it may not be the top priority for players focused solely on maximizing their team’s damage output or the healing amount.

  However, the debuff feature shines particularly in Acheron teams, where it can amplify overall effectiveness, and characters like Feixiao can also benefit significantly from the considerable 18% DMG taken debuff. Conversely, the increased damage taken is less impactful in Firefly teams, where other aspects of Lingsha’s kit may take precedence.

  Learning the local magic in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Creatures of Ava
   </em>
  </strong>
  will allow you to discover new areas and creatures that were originally unreachable due to the limitations you experience while getting to know the world that surrounds you. By completing quests and getting to know the local villagers, you will eventually visit and discover Sagestones that will empower your staff – a popular weapon used in other adventure games –, enabling you to deal with the many dangers of the withering infection.

  During the early stages,
  <em>
   Creatures of Ava
  </em>
  players will encounter the Yellow Witherbloom, a variant of the Witherbloom infection that will block shortcuts and secrets. Thankfully,
  <strong>
   clearing the Yellow Witherbloom
  </strong>
  will be possible quite early as well.

 <p>
  To clear Yellow Witherbloom and make way to new areas and secrets in
  <em>
   Creatures of Ava
  </em>
  , you will have to follow the main quests during your adventure. Just as you did when you got the Nafitar staff at the beginning of the game, you will find what you need inside one of the several temples in Ava. You will be directed toward the one that will enable you to clear Yellow Witherbloom during the quest named
  <strong>
   "Through Stone, We Teach."
  </strong>

 <p>
  Temples themselves are not overly hard to clear in
  <em>
   Creatures of Ava
  </em>
  , so head to the marker on your map and clear the normal Witherbloom until you reach the Sagestone structure. Here you will need to solve a small puzzle that will require you to rotate and align puzzle pieces to form a picture – a classic puzzle seen in the most iconic puzzle games. In this case, the picture depicts some of the inhabitants of Ava sitting around a river.

 <p>
  If you do this successfully, your Nafitar staff will be empowered, and you will receive the
  <strong>
   Krist
  </strong>
  spell, which will enable you to clear Yellow Witherbloom. Just like the Ushun spell, the Krist spell will become available as a second spell you can use in
  <em>
   Creatures of Ava
  </em>
  , in this case, to clear the Yellow Witherbloom.

 <p>
  Using Krist acts like an electric surge whenever you connect your Nafitar stream with Yellow Witherbloom. You will only need to tap the button assigned to Krist while using the staff, and it will send the spell through the stream and open up the Yellow Witherbloom, making it vulnerable to the magic of your Nafitar staff. This way, you will be able to clear it like you normally would do with the normal Witherbloom.

  Not only will Witherbloom be locked behind the Yellow variant of the infection, but so too will several of the creatures you find in Ava. While you can use your staff to cleanse infected creatures and attempt to tame them, some of them are affected by the Yellow variant of the WItherbloom.

 <p>
  You will need to keep an eye on the creature meters that appear when using your staff with said creatures and act accordingly to the encounter, since you will find yourself overwhelmed if you don't use the Krist spell when needed.

  Finally, you can change which spell you assign to each spell button by pressing the RT. Once you unlock more spells across the various ecosystems in
  <em>
   Creatures of Ava
  </em>
  , changing which spells you use when confronted with infected creatures or different puzzles in the world will be vital.

 <p>
  That said, the secondary spell assigned to RT will only trigger if you tap it, since keeping it pressed will pop out the spell wheel, which can be an annoyance – you can't rebind each action, but time slows down when you bring up the wheel.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  confirms the next three Community Day event dates happening within the upcoming season. The mobile title continues to be a popular one for players, part of which could be due to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's live-service nature. As such, the game is constantly refreshing itself with new content, quests, and other activities to try to keep players logging in each day to see what sort of new things there are to do or Pokemon have spawned in.

 <p>
  While not every
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  update has been a hit with fans, the game does have a very stable set of events that typically happens each month. These include things like Raid Events, themed weeks, and, of course, the monthly Community Day which puts a specific Pokemon in the spotlight for a set number of hours on a particular day. For many fans, these Community Day activities are a great way to catch a high stat version as well as potentially capturing a rare shiny variant. With the next season rapidly approaching,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  is giving all players a heads up on when to expect to see the next trio of Community Day events.

  have been confirmed for the next three months with the first arriving on September 14, followed by October 5, and then November 10, closing out the seasonal trio of events.

  While there's still plenty of mystery surrounding these events, including which Pokemon could be featured as well as the times they'll be available from, Niantic didn't stop there with new events on the horizon. In the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  season, Niantic also confirmed a handful of other in-game events to keep an eye out for, specifically a new Raid Day on Sunday, September 8 and Saturday, October 12. Similarly, two additional Research Day events are also on the way, with the first launching on Sunday September 22 and a second on Sautrday, October 19. Again, details are limited, with Niantic indicating more information is on the way at a later date.

 <p>
  In the meantime, Niantic has recently confirmed the August Community Day Classic details, launching on August 18 with the "Iron Ball Pokemon" Beldum being featured. As expected, Beldum will be appearing much more frequently in the wild, with evolutions happening up to two hours after the event giving Metagross the Meteor Mash charged attack. Egg hatch distance is also being reduced by a quarter, lures and incense will last 3 hours, and taking snapshots during this event may generate a surprise.

  A decade after
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Sims 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  launched, EA finally released a dating-centered expansion pack:
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Lovestruck
  </em>
  . Like dating expansion packs in previous iterations of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lovestruck
  </em>
  aims to spice up the game's romance mechanic by adding new social interactions, dating activities, and buy mode items. In addition,
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Lovestruck
  </em>
  also includes a new neighborhood called Ciudad Enamorada, known for its romantic vibe, nightclubs, and other dating hotspots for sims to explore and find love.

 <p>
  Among
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Lovestruck's
  </em>
  many new features are two new romance-centered aspirations: Romantic Explorer and Paragon Partner. These new aspirations expanded
  <em>
   The Sims 4's
  </em>
  Love aspiration and were added alongside Serial Romantic and Soulmate. What sets the Romantic Explorer and Paragon Partner apart is that both include a list of milestones players must complete to fulfill their chosen aspirations, resulting in rewards and dating perks.

  The Romantic Explorer aspiration in
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Lovestruck
  </em>
  is perfect for romantics at heart. With this aspiration selected, Sims aims to explore every single dating interaction available in the game and experience romance to the fullest.
  <em>
   The Sims 4's
  </em>
  Romantic Explorer aspiration is perfect for players who love to partake in as many romantic activities as possible, from going on dates to being physically intimate with their partner, keeping the fire of romance burning for as long as possible.

  The milestones players must complete to be successful in the Romantic Explorer aspiration well reflect the outgoing and engaging nature of this aspiration. Sims, who are Romantic Explorers, have three levels of milestones to complete: Spark of Love, Expanding Boundaries, and Amour Connoisseur. Each of these levels will have sims get to know their dates, discuss romantic boundaries with their partner, increase their sims' romance skills, and perform several romantic gestures, which includes having to WooHoo in three different locations, among many others.

 <p>
  One of the new features introduced in
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Lovestruck
  </em>
  is polyamorous relationships, which are highlighted in the Paragon Partner aspiration. Sims who choose the Paragon Partner aspiration aim to have successful relationships with two or more sims simultaneously. While the Romantic Explorer aspiration is focused on the many activities and interactions sims can partake in with their partner, the Paragon Partner aspiration revolves around having multiple relationships with established romantic boundaries.

 <p>
  It is worth noting that the milestones players must complete in the Paragon Partner aspiration are much smaller compared to the Romantic Explorer. To fulfill the Paragon Partner aspiration, players need only to complete one milestone, which will involve establishing romantic boundaries in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , having at least two partners, and going on several dates with a partner sim. Like the Romantic Explorer, fulfilling the Paragon Partner aspiration will earn players rewards, such as aspiration points that players can spend in the reward store, alongside a new reward trait that would help players maintain relationships more easily in
  <em>
   The Sims 4.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  has released an exciting new Zombies trailer showcasing one of the two launch maps, a new wonder weapon, and a host of returning features. Set in the early 90s,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  picks up after the events of 2020's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  , and is also a direct sequel to the fan-favorite
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is looking to launch with 16 original multiplayer maps, and is rumored to be adding a slew of remastered
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  maps post-launch.

 <p>
  It's been four years since the last round-based Zombies experience in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.
  </em>
  Since then, Zombies fans have been clamoring for a return to form for the beloved mode after
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Vanguard
  </em>
  's experimental Zombies experience underwhelmed a year later. Last year,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  became the first ever
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  entry to feature a Zombies co-op mode in the name of MWZ. The open world
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  -style experience satisfied fans of more recent
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  entries, but fans of classic Zombies felt largely disappointed by the mode.

 <p>
  In the lead-up to the return of round-based Zombies in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , a new trailer dropped giving fans a deeper look at one of the game's two launch maps, Terminus, an island prison reminiscent of the fan-favorite
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  map Mob of the Dead. The enthralling trailer gives a brief glimpse at a new Wonder Weapon, called the Beam Smasher, which emits a powerful yellow beam to slice up Zombies with. An interesting new boxing glove-wielding perk machine named Melee Macchiato was also shown giving players powerful melee punching attacks, and a new injectable serum gives players a powerful armor suit to blast their way through the zombie hordes with.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  returning to round-based Zombies for the first time in four years, it seems fitting that it would include the return of several
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies staples. This new trailer confirmed the return of the Gobblegum buffs that were first introduced in
  <em>
   Black Ops 3
  </em>
  . Additionally, the essential Pack-A-Punch machine, Mystery Boxes, and the often life-saving Monkey Bombs will be at players' disposal as well. The past decade of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies has seen many new systems introduced that may have over-complicated the round-based Zombies experience. Based off this trailer, it seems
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies mode will be more refined and not as needlessly complex as some previous
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies offerings.

  The
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Terminus trailer concluded with a short tease of the game's second launch map, Liberty Falls, letting fans know they can tune into Call of Duty Next on August 28 to catch live gameplay of the upcoming Zombies map. Liberty Falls seems to be a much lighter setting compared to Terminus, as it looks to take place in a small American town.
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  's classic Jet Gun wonder weapon also made a brief blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance during the Liberty Falls tease. There seems to be a lot for fans of earlier
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies games to look forward to when
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  drops on October 25.

  Radical Fish Games, the studio behind the hit 2018 game
  <strong>
   <em>
    CrossCode
   </em>
  </strong>
  , has revealed more details about its newest project. Originally titled
  <em>
   Project Terra,
  </em>
  Radical Fish Games has now officially announced the name and released a reveal trailer for the
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  successor,
  <em>
   <strong>

 <p>
  In 2018, Radical Fish Games released the action RPG
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  for PC.
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  was later released for consoles including Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch in 2020. The game was set in the distant future and featured a retro-inspired art style with incredibly smooth and satisfying physics.
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  was well received by players, earning several awards and currently boasting a 94% positive review rating on Steam.

  With the success of
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  , Radical Fish Games began development on another project, Project Terra, a few years ago. In the latest update on the project, the team revealed the new title's official name and released the first official trailer.
  <em>
   Alabaster Dawn
  </em>
  will be another top-down 2.5D action RPG featuring a similar retro art style as
  <em>
   CrossCode
  </em>
  . Players will solve intricate puzzles, battle enemies in a deeply engaging combat system, and unravel the secrets of a deep and compelling story within
  <em>
   Alabaster Dawn
  </em>
  .

  Although only the first few hours of gameplay are completed,

  </em>
  for players to try out. Alongside this, Radical Fish Games is considering releasing the game in early access in late 2025, similar to what they did with the release of

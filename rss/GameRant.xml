  There are quite a few different weapons in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and until players become experienced with this game, it's going to be pretty tough to tell which weapon is good and which needs to be left behind. The huge skill gap in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  is partly the reason for this. No matter how good a player's weapon may be, other players are just going to be winning gunfights against them because of their knowledge of the game. That doesn't mean that the weapons absent on this list can't be perfectly effective, of course. But in a scenario where everything is even, weapons on this list are likely to win out against weapons that aren't.
 </p>
 <p>
  These weapons are not just ranked by their possible damage output, but also by their ease of use. It doesn't matter if a weapon has incredible damage per second if it's nearly impossible to keep its shots on target. With the
  <strong>
   best guns in
   <em>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players can decimate their opponents in no time flat.

   <strong>
    Updated on January 21, 2025, by Mehrdad Khayyat:
   </strong>
   With the release of the Y9S4.2 patch, Ubisoft applied a series of changes to a wide variety of weapons that shook up the meta a little bit. This includes a significant nerf affecting all slug shotguns, making them less effective in long-range gunfights.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said, one of the slug shotguns managed to get away from this massive nerf by receiving a huge damage buff that makes it the new gun meta among the defenders after, ending the reign of ACS12 and BossG for now.

  An assault rifle with some serious firepower, no one should be sleeping on the
  <strong>
   SC3000K
  </strong>
  . Spraying this bad boy in a room full of hostiles is a recipe for a bloodbath. Just make sure to keep an eye on the weapon's remaining ammo before going in guns-blazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might not be as rapid as some of the other assault rifles on this list, but its impressive damage more than makes up for this. It's a great weapon that players can use to mount pressure on their opposition... but players should keep in mind that being a one-man army with any weapon in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  isn't recommended, especially since players can be dropped in record time if they get overwhelmed by the opposition.

  The
  <strong>
   SMG-11
  </strong>
  is the best secondary weapon to ever exist in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , especially for defenders. While shotguns are quite useful in defensive scenarios, players must sacrifice their primary slot for a shotgun without bringing anything good for mid-range and long-range gunfights.
 </p>
 <p>
  SMG-11 perfectly fills in that gap. Thanks to the recoil system upgrade, it is now easier to control SMG-11 than before, though players still need to kill with burst fire, as the weapon doesn't have enough ammo in the reserve. The combination of an SMG-11 and a shotgun is the deadliest arsenal players can ever face in an attacking round, as their opponent holds two powerful weapons for both close-range and long-range battles.

  Thanks to the shotgun overhaul in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , one of the weakest weapons in the game has turned into a solid run-and-gun weapon. Even now,
  <strong>
   Six12 SD
  </strong>
  doesn't get the love it deserves, but that is mostly due to an old assumption that players think Six12 SD doesn't deal enough damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its magazine-based bullet entry makes Six12 SD the best shotgun for roamers. Players are no longer required to toss in their bullets one by one, and that's a much-needed feature for roamers. Some may say SPAS-12 has the same feature too, but how could anyone turn a blind eye to 20 more damage units per shot with the Six12 SD?

  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  categorizes
  <strong>
   ACS12
  </strong>
  as a slug shotgun, but it used to operate more like a marksman rifle thanks to its incredibly long effective range. And that was the reason why all slug shotguns received a nerf with a Year 9 Season 4 patch, resulting in the player base losing interest in using them as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said, ACS12 is still a devastating weapon in close-and-mid-range gunfights, but the problem is that the damage drop-off for all slug shotguns has been reduced, which affects the weapon's capability to score easy kills when watching long angles, though a headshot is still a headshot!

  Monika "IQ" Weiss is a powerful attacking operator that players are surely going to have a blast with. This is mainly due to her powerful assault rifle, the
  <strong>
   552 Commando
  </strong>
  , which is now shared with Grim too. Although the recoil may be a bit much to deal with at first, those who get the hang of it will find the 552 Commando to be a reliable weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Featuring three firing modes, the 552 Commando is a highly versatile firearm. It feels great to use, and victory is almost guaranteed with players who know the ins and outs of this weapon. On PC, recoil can be even more manageable as long as players adjust their aim accordingly, turning this firearm into a dealer of death that most opponents will give a wide berth.

  Thermite and Osa are recipients of this brilliant Swiss assault rifle. Its great damage and decent stopping power make it a great weapon in any situation. As long as players adapt the proper tactics, the
  <strong>
   556XI
  </strong>
  should drop most foes like flies in the blink of an eye. The weapon's relatively low recoil ensures a more precise shot, especially when aiming at enemies from mid-range.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can fire using both Automatic and Semi-Automatic modes, giving players more options when it comes to engaging the enemy. Given how malleable players need to be to deal with the dynamic nature of the firefights in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , it's easy to see why so many players love this weapon.

  Introduced in the
  <em>
   Operation Red Crow
  </em>
  expansion pack, the
  <strong>
   Type-89
  </strong>
  is a reliable gun wielded by Hibana that will help players in a tight spot during matches... although it certainly has its drawbacks that can turn any situation into an unfavorable one in a heartbeat.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the fire rate and high damage of this weapon are certainly a boon, the criminally small magazine size means that players can quickly find themselves out of ammo in a firefight, which can spell doom for their fate in the match. This problem can be curbed if players rely on their teammates and make their shots count, which is the norm that should be followed in any round of
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  as is. Even if they adapt to the small magazine size, it will take players some time to control that crazy horizontal recoil.

  Another weapon that's received a nerf (though this nerf is much less recent), the
  <strong>
   R4-C
  </strong>
  is an incredible weapon, especially knowing that it has retained its ACOG. Ash's primary role as an entry fragger requires her to have a pretty stellar weapon, and the R4-C more than fills that role.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has a nice fire rate and manageable recoil. Because Ash typically moves around the map with some serious speed, having a consistent weapon like the R4-C that allows players to run and gun with ease is perfect. Of course, players shouldn't throw caution to the wind, since there's nothing more humiliating than trying to treat
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  like they would in a game of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ... only to be gunned down in a comical manner.

  One of the weapons on Defense with access to the ACOG, the
  <strong>
   MP5
  </strong>
  isn't only useful because of its zoom; it's a very good weapon in its own right. While the argument can certainly be made for using the P90, especially if players plan on using that weapon entirely at close range, the MP5 beats it in all-around performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The MP5 has some great stability and a very nice rate of fire, making it easy to get headshots at any range, thanks in part to that ACOG. It's easily one of the most satisfying weapons to use in the game and a favorite of many
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  fans.

  One of the greatest SMGs in the game by a country mile, the
  <strong>
   MP7
  </strong>
  boasts a massive rate of fire that makes it an ideal weapon to decimate enemies in close quarters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep in mind that the recoil of the MP7 is massive, making it quite hard to fire in long bursts and hit enemies that are further away. However, players who manage to take these detriments into account will find themselves enjoying one of the most fun weapons in the entire game. Ripping through an enemy with the high fire rate of this brilliant SMG never gets old, no matter how frequently players might use this weapon.

  Another weapon that has absolutely ludicrous stability, the
  <strong>
   9x19VSN
  </strong>
  available to both the Lord himself, Tachanka, Kapkan, and Azami, is a great weapon capable of crazy amounts of destruction. This weapon has a somewhat lackluster damage-per-second, but because of its ability to keep all its shots on target (and because the Spetsnaz have access to some really great open scopes), the 9x19VSN is one of the easiest weapons to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who are just getting into
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  will find it pretty easy to get into the game while using this weapon. While players can move on to bigger and better weapons later on, there's nothing wrong with learning the ropes while using a more forgiving weapon like the 9x19VSN.

  Added to the game with Skopos, PCX-33 is one of the most comfortable defender SMGs in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  . While it is not as perfect as Commando 9 when it comes to the recoil pattern, it delivers an impressive DPS rate for an SMG along with a big enough magazine and decent ADS time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, it didn't receive a nerf after the release of Skopos, which helps it maintain its position among the top 3 powerful SMGs in the disposal of Defenders. The only downside is that PCX-33 is exclusive to Skopos at the moment, and players will need to learn the dual-body strategies if they want to benefit from this SMG.

  The
  <strong>
   AK-12
  </strong>
  has long been, statistically, the best weapon in the game, and that's by a pretty decent margin, too. When this weapon only belonged to Fuze, it had a pretty manageable recoil, but when the weapon was shared with Ace, one of the most highly-picked operators in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  , Ubisoft had to mess around with the recoil pattern.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the AK-12 is still as powerful as before, players cannot easily control its recoil if they don't train enough with this assault rifle. While players wish this recoil change was never applied, it is probably the best way to hold Ace back from being the most overpowered operator in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  .

  This weapon is absolutely nuts, and it's insane to think that this weapon used to be equipped with an ACOG, too. Jager's
  <strong>
   416-C Carbine
  </strong>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  has a pretty solid damage-per-bullet and rate of fire, but as with some of the high-recoil assault rifles, it's not easy to control this weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not many defenders have access to an AR in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , and there are indeed some good reasons behind that. Using an AR as a defender should be costly to balance, and players will feel that cost in the harsh vertical recoil of 416-C Carbine.

  With the latest patch on weapon balancing, Ubisoft decided to reduce both vertical and horizontal recoil for the G36C, which used to be quite an underrated weapon for some time. Now, this attacker assault rifle has elevated significantly in the meta, as its milder recoil compared to R4C (Ash) and ARX200 (Iana), makes it look a lot more promising.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the DPS rate for G36C still remains behind both of its competitors with a significant margin, but landing a headshot with this weapon requires less recoil-control skills, and that becomes a selling point for it, especially in low-elo and mid-elo lobbies.

  There's clearly a trend of assault rifles boasting the highest damage and usability in the game. After all, these weapons are good from both short and medium ranges, and most
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  encounters happen within such confines anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   ARX200
  </strong>
  makes for another great assault rifle in the vast line of weapons available for the game. This weapon made its debut through the
  <em>
   Operation Wind Bastion
  </em>
  expansion pack, with both Nomad and Iana being able to use this powerful weapon. It's another valuable addition to a string of impressive weaponry in the game, and players will love using these Operators to wreak havoc against their enemies.

  In the not much older versions of
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , scopes and damage rates were two major factors in distinguishing assault rifles and SMGs. The former is now gone, and the only thing that makes assault rifles superior is the higher damage dealt with each bullet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   AR33
  </strong>
  , however, does not only benefit from a higher damage rate. It is also one of the easiest attacker weapons to control when it comes to the recoil. Few attacker weapons come with a 700+ rate of fire while having a small vertical recoil, and AR33 checks both boxes. It is one of the best weapons to begin with in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  , and it comes with two of the most useful operators as well.

  While Jackal may not necessarily be an Operator that anybody gets to play very often due to his relatively high ban rate in lower skill levels, if the stars align, and he's actually available to snag for a match, his
  <strong>
   C7E
  </strong>
  is a fantastic choice to bring along with him. The C7E is just a consistent weapon with a good fire rate and easy-to-predict recoil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many times, Jackal is going to come upon enemies who are expecting his presence, since he's been scanning their footsteps, so he needs to be able to win those 50/50 gunfights consistently. The C7E helps immensely in that regard, though Jackal's low pick rate doesn't let many players feel the power of this hidden gem.

  Maverick's
  <strong>
   M4
  </strong>
  is flat-out, an absolute machine. Maverick's utility creates a lot of situations where players will be in a gunfight with a very small angle to see through, so it's definitely necessary for him to have a weapon that stays pretty stable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The M4 is not only great in that regard, but it also has a very good damage-per-shot and rate of fire, exceeding the middle of the pack in both regards. While his utility may not be the best for every scenario, his weaponry makes him a great option for a fragger.

  Aruni and Dokkaebi both have access to this weapon as their primary option, and it is indeed a capable marksman rifle in
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  . The biggest plus for Mk 14 EBR is its 20-round magazine, which helps players a lot with not only covering missed shots but also opening holes on destructible surfaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to its DMR nature, players can use a silencer as a muzzle attachment without worrying about recoil to remain as stealthy as possible. This is more beneficial to Dokkaebi, who is a 3-Speed attacker and will definitely want to keep a low profile on the map while making his way inside the bomb rooms.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill f
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been rated in South Korea, which could indicate that the horror game will be available sometime soon. Not much has been revealed about
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  <em>
   f
  </em>
  , and the game does not have an official release date, so it’s somewhat surprising to see it being rated in one region.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  was originally announced in 2022 during Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission with a short trailer. Unlike the previous games in the series,
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  will be set in 1960s Japan, not in the United States. While the trailer didn’t show any gameplay, it presented a bit of the setting, which seems to be a small Japanese town, along with the likely protagonist, a young girl being tormented by plant-like tendrils coming out of the walls. Since then, however, Konami has been mostly silent about the upcoming project.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the South Korean ratings board has rated
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  alongside
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  . Games are generally only rated when they are content-complete, which may hint at the project being released soon. This is surprising, however, due to how
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  has received almost no marketing at all so far. What could make the theory stronger, though, is that
  <em>
   Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  was already planned for 2024 and then delayed, meaning that it’s another game that is possibly almost ready to be released.

 <p>
  It’s hard to say what fans should expect from
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  <em>
   f
  </em>
  . By having a completely different setting, it’s possible that this will be a very different entry in the franchise. The game’s story was written by Ryukishi07, a prominent visual novelist known for psychological horror stories such as
  <em>
   Higurashi: When They Cry
  </em>
  , which still hints that it may be focused on psychological aspects, like other entries in the series.

 <p>
  Microsoft will hold its Xbox Developer Direct showcase on January 23. One of the games rumored to appear there is a mystery game from a well-established Japanese IP, which means that it could potentially be
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  . However, this is just speculation at this point, as it could be a number of other titles as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, it remains to be seen when
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  will be released. The
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake was a big hit, selling over a million units in three days, but it had a pretty strong marketing presence. It would be unusual for this game to be released without Konami marketing it heavily before the launch.

  The character designer behind
  <strong>
   Donkey Kong
  </strong>
  's longest-running look has shared his feelings over the apparent redesign that the iconic Nintendo character will be seeing on the Switch 2. Donkey Kong has undergone three major transformations since his introduction to the world in 1981, and esteemed character designer Kevin Bayliss is now weighing in on the latest change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hired by Rare as lead character artist in 1987, Bayliss is credited with designing the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  characters, including an overhaul of the title character from his antagonistic 8-bit role to his newer heroic persona on the SNES. That series saw its first installment in 1994, and though minor changes have since occurred to keep up with graphical advances, Bayliss' design stood for 30 years as the standard look for Donkey Kong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another change seems to be on the horizon for the big ape. After months of speculation, Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 console in a trailer released earlier in January. While most of that trailer focused on the hardware, it also showed off footage from what appears to be an unreleased
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  game, with a big change to Donkey Kong's design. Although this new design features much rounder, bulkier features and a more pleasant-looking demeanor than his now 30-year-old look, Bayliss seems highly accepting of the change. The designer made his thoughts known in a reaction on Twitter to a fan's video that borrows footage from the live-action
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  movie from 1993 to detail the changes. "I love it - this is really funny! - Everything changes! - Change is good," the post reads in part.

 <p>
  After being promoted to art director, Bayliss left Rare in 2005 after more than 17 years with the company. He has been employed with Playtonic, the creator of games like
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Yooka-Laylee
  </em>
  series, for the past 10 years. However, his classic design archetypes for the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  characters have stretched into 2025 with the release of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong County Returns HD
  </em>
  on January 16.

 <p>
  As for the new design for Donkey Kong, it may be an attempt by Nintendo to bridge the gap between its games and movies, forming a more unified multimedia franchise. Several comparisons have been made between the version of Donkey Kong seen in the Switch 2 trailer and the Seth Rogen-voiced character in
  <em>
   The Super Mario Bros. Movie
  </em>
  from 2023, such as a rounder brow, larger forearms and fists, and more expressive eyes.

  The new boss fight gameplay trailer for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phantom Blade Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  came with a tease that the game's release date will be revealed sometime in 2025. Previously, developers at S-GAME mentioned that the game had a launch window set for fall 2026. For now, all players can do is wait until the developer announces the specific release date for
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  , which is set to launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chinese developer S-GAME first unveiled
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  during the 2023 Sony State of Play. Since its announcement,
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  has drawn comparisons to
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden.
  </em>
  In the game, players take on the role of Soul, an assassin who was framed for the murder of his masters.
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  blends Chinese Kung Fu with steampunk elements, which the developers have dubbed a kungfupunk Wuxia world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  has received a brand-new six-minute gameplay trailer showcasing a high-octane boss fight with astounding action. At the end of the trailer, a tease announces that the action game's release date will be unveiled in 2025. During last year's Summer Game Fest, developers stated that
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  was slated for fall 2026. However, without a specific date locked in, it could be subject to change at any time, whether pushed forward or postponed.

 <p>
  In addition to the release date tease, the preview featured an impressive boss fight in
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  , highlighting the slickness of combat and an incredibly agile and creative moveset. Many initially thought the samurai game would be a Soulslike, but previews claim it leans more toward a fast-paced hack-and-slash experience similar to
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden.
  </em>
  In an interview, S-GAME's CEO, Soulframe Liang, described
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  as "
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  combat on a
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  game map," perfectly summarizing the game's concept.

  Since the trailer is titled "Year of the Snake
  <em>
   ,"
  </em>
  the weapons used by the protagonist feature serpent-inspired designs. At the end, the protagonist showcases his skillset with various weapons, including the Soft Snake Sword, which appears to have a more flexible blade, and the White Serpent and Crimson Viper, which feature a dual-blade fighting style. S-GAME confirmed that blades will be the primary weapons in
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  while secondary weapons, referred to as shachi weapons, can range from cannons to lances and massive hammers. The game will feature over 20 shachi weapons, adding an impressive layer of variety to the combat system.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  looks incredibly promising and has all the makings of another major success. Now, all that's left is to find out the official release date and eagerly await the game's arrival.

  player could use an extra gun to help them in the conquest to claim a Victory Royale. Since

  With Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1, there are 4 hireable NPCs found on the map, and these Specialists will all have their own asking price, weaponry, and special function, so players will need to know where they can be found and what they actually do so that they have the best AI-teammate possible.

  Helsie is located at Canyon Crossing, a bottom left POI close to Shogun's Solitude. Helsie is usually found roaming the upper part of Canyon Crossing closest to the buildings by the road.
 </p>
 <p>
  Helsie is most likely the best NPC to hire due to her role as a Medic Specialist, as she will randomly throw Chug Splashes towards the player and their allies when they are in need of any Health or Shield, no matter how little that might be. While her Specialist role is great, Helsie doesn't have the best weapon, as her Surgefire SMG lacks the accuracy from far away battles, and only sees an increase in the rate of fire with consistent use.

  Vi is located at the Rolling Blossoms Farm, which is found between Seaport City and Hopeful Heights, noted by the colorful blossom fields.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a Scout Specialist, Vi will randomly throw out a recon pulse that will reveal other enemies on the map that are within the vicinity of Vi's scanner. This means that players will be able to mark other players as red blips and even see their outlines, making it possible to catch them unaware or stay focused on their positioning to avoid being caught by an unexpected play. Vi also has one of the best weapons for a hired NPC, as she carries the Holo Twister Assault Rifle, providing her with decent range for battles at a distance.

  Mizuki is located at Lost Lake, which is one of the POIs close to the center of the map, but more to the upper left between Twinkle Terrace and Brutal Boxcars.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a Supply Specialist, Mizuki will randomly throw out ammunition depending on what the players on her team need. This can be great for players who want to abuse the supply system, as depending on what they are holding, depends on what Mizuki provides. If players hold a Shockwave Grenade, they will drop some, and vice versa for the ammo depending on the weapon type the player has. As for her weapon, Mizuki uses the Fury AR, which despite the notion of hitscan, suffers from its recoil and lack of range.

  Cinder is located at the Open-Air Onsen, which is a Landmark found South of Demon's Dojo, located in a small lake just before the road to Shattered Span.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a Heavy Specialist, Cinder is a bit of a risky player to have on the team due to her role, as she will just throw grenades. That's about it for her Specialist ability, and while these grenades won't harm the player, they might be a bit of a nuisance due to the fact that they can destroy structures. Cinder is a walking bullet sponge because of this, and even her main weapon, the Sentinel Pump Shotgun, proves her efficiency at close-range battles.

  Each Specialist has a unique ability that they can activate randomly once they have been hired. Not every Specialist is the same, meaning that their ability and their tool kit will be different. However, what is consistent across the hired NPCs is that they will always follow the player who hired them, even in a Squad setting. Individual players cannot hire multiple Specialists, but another player on the team who has not hired a Specialist can. This means that players can claim all 4 Specialists in a Squads match, and have 8 players (4 real, 4 NPCs) in their team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The behavior of a Specialist works like a bot does in a Battle Royale match, as it will follow the player who hired them, and then immediately become aggressive when they spot a hostile player. Their accuracy isn't great, so they aren't the most reliable when it comes to dealing damage, but where they really shine is in the fact that they are essentially a bullet sponge to take the aggro of enemies.
  <strong>
   Hireable NPCs have around 400 Shield and 100 Health
  </strong>
  , and these can be restored with Chug Splashes. This is what makes NPCs such a viable option in combat, due to their large health pool to keep the enemy's attention, while also using their Specialist ability to aid their allies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The map below will showcase exactly where each hireable NPC can be found:

  Chapter 6 Season 1 only has 4 Specialists, as seen in the map above, but that doesn't mean that more won't come in the future, especially with the impending arrival of Chapter 6 Season 2.

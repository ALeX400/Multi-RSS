  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latest expansion from Netherrealm Studios and has brought a ton of changes. It features six new DLC kharacters, with three already out, multiple new skins, stages, Animalities, balance changes, and a five-chapter long story mode expansion centered around the Lin Kuei and Havik.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  might have been a little too short and ended abruptly, but overall it is a solid expansion, and the most notable highlight is Titan Havik. Havik finally gets to shine as a full-fledged antagonist, rather than a backup bad guy. One of the strongest parts of
  <em>
   Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  is the Cleric of Khaos just being himself, and while some fans may feel he didn't get enough of the spotlight, he's a focal point of the story for long enough to leave fans wanting more, and teasing future expansions.

  The
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat X
  </em>
  comics act as a sort of prequel or bridge to the events of
  <em>
   MKX
  </em>
  itself. While the comics did receive a fair amount of critical and fan praise, nothing from the comics really ties down to any part of the narrative of future games.

 <p>
  One of the key highlights of the MKX Comics was Havik as the primary antagonist, working in the shadows and manipulating others to do his bidding. This was a very popular characterization of Havik and fans were hoping to see something similar. With the disappointment of
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  Havik being nothing like his comic counterpart, Titan Havik was a welcome addition. While Titan Havik is a more maniacal and whimsical version of the character, it is still great to see the Cleric get his due nearly a decade later.

  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  as a franchise has spent a lot of time focusing on Shao Kahn and Shang Tsung as villains. While both of them are excellent characters, with Shao Kahn being an expected mainstay, both characters may be a bit too over-saturated. Shang Tsung has had two incredible back-to-back potrayals, in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  and in the main story of
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  as well. Aside from them, Kronika was seen as underutilized and never really became a big success, nor did Shinnok.

 <p>
  A step away from larger-than-life characters and iconic villains has given the game a fresh breath of life. While Havik
  <em>
   is
  </em>
  a titan, he doesn't fit the same bill as some of the previous villains in the story. His motivations are simple, and he represents a realm that the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  universe hasn't utilized in a long time. Hopefully, his involvement is a sign of using other 3D-era characters more.

 <p>
  Probably the best reason why Havik as the main villain of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  works so well is that Havik himself was wildly entertaining. His design was incredible, with the strange helmet and hair combo somehow working out for him. He was menacing when necessary, particularly with how he used his limbs, and his voice acting was captivating.

 <p>
  While Havik didn't have any underlying motivations or complex ideology underpinning his character, he didn't need anything such as that at all. His motivation was to spread Khaos and that's all he needed. Havik's realm was visually stunning, as were his death maze and his odd collection of henchmen. His bouts of fury and his on-the-nose hypocrisy make for a captivating and fun villain that players see just enough of to stay invested in.

 <p>
  Aside from giving fans more
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  content, one of the real purposes of the expansion was to push forward Liu Kang's timeline in line with events from the original timeline. The death of Scorpion's wife, the descent of Bi-Han into Noob, and the Cyber Lin Kuei are all massive events in the original timeline that are dealt with here.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":931} -->

 <p>
  Havik is sort of used as a tool to push these forward. In the aftermath of Bi-Han's failed attack on Kuai Liang's wedding, he fights Havik and is caught and turned into Noob Saibot. Similarly, Scorpion, Sektor, and Cyrax embark on a rescue mission which expands on their characters while also progressing the narrative. The conflict between Sektor and Cyrax is evident, as is the direction in which Scorpion plans on leading the Shirai Ryu. By the end of the expansion, Havik's plot has led to an established Noob Saibot who isn't purely evil, a new grandmaster for the Lin Kuei, and some seeds of dissent in Liu Kang's new era. This may not have been possible effectively with a more established villain who would require more narrative attention.

  <em>
   MK1: Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  was a seemingly brief story with an abrupt ending. Players never get to see what actually happens to Havik, nor do they see what happens to Noob. Classic storytelling tropes would point to this, meaning fans can expect more Havik, or a further expansion someday soon. With the limited presence of the Kamidogu and Havik's abrupt and unclear demise, it may be that the Cleric of Khaos could serve as the harbinger of a future foe, or serve to spoil Liu Kang's new era from safely taking shape.

 <p>
  Havik as the main villain could also be the catalyst for Netherrealm Studios leaning further on 3D era characters, or bringing more plot relevance to some of the under-utilized realms in the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>

  As
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  ’s early days have been a success, the road has been paved for the game's future to get even better. Not only has a road map stretching into 2025 already been laid out to add various new cosmetics and gameplay challenges, but multiple updates have also been released with plenty of bug fixes and new features. September 26 played host to the third major update, which included various welcome additions like the Hub Sparring Arena, private and truly solo missions in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's Operations, improved AI allies, and ultrawide support for PC. However, one subtle but surprisingly impactful change came from one tiny text change during

  ’s ending.

  Once the campaign’s final battle is complete, a CG cutscene follows. The lead protagonist, Titus, disrupts the Thousand Sons sorcerer Imurah’s ritual, destroying him and the Chaos artifact he’d been using. Its destruction also seems to destroy the extradimensional space their fight was taking place in, knocking Titus out before he is awoken by a crowd of Ultramarines. However, during the black screen between these two scenes, a disembodied voice tells Titus “Rise, son of Guilliman.” It was attributed to Ultramarine Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, who is present in the scene, but that’s where the change comes in.

  Now, this single line is simply assigned the generic tag “Voice,” which just about every

  Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick stated in a Q&amp;A tweet that the line was meant to be up to interpretation, but mentioned he had something specific in mind when he wrote it, and that IP owner Games Workshop may have forced a change if it was explicitly the Emperor. Combined with this reply being written before the subtitle correction was made, the intent here is easy to assume, although doing so also radically reframes

 <p>
  From the ending of the first
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  game to the final scene of this one, much attention is drawn to Titus’ unusually high resistance to Chaos corruption. Despite interacting with a powerful Chaos artifact and Daemons multiple times, in addition to having his mind messed with by a sorcerer and diving into a Warp-derived pocket dimension, Titus has never shown any signs of corruption. The mere implication that the Emperor of Mankind has spoken to him points to Titus being under the Emperor’s psychic protection, and he is destined for great deeds in future potential

   Space Marine
  </em>
  games or DLC.

  How The Emperor's Protection Fits In Space Marine’s Story
 </h3>
 <p>
  Due to the present state of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  ’s setting involving all Psykers being empowered by the massive rift dividing the Imperium of Man’s galaxy, contact from the Emperor is not particularly farfetched. However, it's still a big deal whenever it happens, especially since Titus is otherwise a standard Primaris Ultramarine. The Emperor's ambiguously-divine intervention is typically reserved either for the especially pious Sisters of Battle, or for exceptional people like his resurrected Primarch sons Roboute Guilliman and Lion El’Jonson, so Titus’ instance is a big deal. Hopefully, fans won't have to wait long to see what this means for future

  stories.

 <p>
  Released for the Apple II on October 3, 1989, the first
  <em>
   <strong>
    Prince of Persia
   </strong>
  </em>
  was an immediate critical hit, garnering acclaim for its groundbreaking rotoscoping animation techniques that gave the game's platforming a sense of realism that hadn't been achieved before.
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  was quickly ported to just about every console and PC iteration at the time, making it one of the most prolific games of its era. 35 years later, the
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  franchise has come a long way.

  In the decade following the original's release,
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  would receive two sequels, both of which received middling reviews. The franchise was rebooted with 2003's
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
  </em>
  , still widely considered to be one of the best entries in series history. But then along came some disappointing sequels and even more reboots, and
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  found itself on ice. But this year,
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  made its triumphant return, and arguably, the series is bigger and better than it's ever been before.

  Prince of Persia Has Had an Impressive Comeback Year
 </h3>
 <p>
  After a 14-year-long hiatus, the
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  franchise returned earlier this year with
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
  </em>
  . A 2.5D Metroidvania with some incredible platforming mechanics, smooth animations, engaging combat, and a distinct art style,
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
  </em>
  was the return to form that fans had been waiting over a decade for.

 <p>
  Then, seemingly out of the blue, just a few months after
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
  </em>
  's release in January,
  <em>
   The Rogue Prince of Persia
  </em>
  was announced. A 2D roguelike action-platformer,
  <em>
   The Rogue Prince of Persia
  </em>
  hit Steam early access in May, and it's continued to receive a consistent stream of updates since launch, bringing new enemies, weapons, biomes, and story content to the game at a steady pace.

 <p>
  A key similarity between these two 2024
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  projects – and a core strength of both – is that they hearken back to the original 1989 game while still pushing the franchise forward in significant ways. For instance,
  <em>
   The Rogue Prince of Persia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Lost Crown
  </em>
  feature a 2D perspective and emphasize smooth platforming mechanics and animations, just as the original 1989 game did 35 years ago. But these games also feature plenty of modern bells and whistles that were needed to make the franchise stand out in the modern market.

  Prince of Persia Might Be Here to Stay

 <p>
  During the Ubisoft Forward showcase back in June,
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  had a dedicated section all to itself. Along with a DLC announcement for
  <em>
   The Lost Crown
  </em>
  , Ubisoft also confirmed that the long-awaited
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
  </em>
  remake is still in development. While Ubisoft is in some troubled waters at the minute, it seems likely that
  <em>
   The Sands of Time
  </em>
  remake will eventually release, and that means that the
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  franchise is here to stay for at least a little while longer.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been under fire lately, leading to a delay and a new release date of February 14, 2025. Based on what Ubisoft has outright confirmed,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is still on track to eventually be released, and that might be even further confirmed by a recent leak that suggests something unique about its gameplay.

 <p>
  According to recent reports,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will feature a co-op mode, currently codenamed "LEAGUE." The explicit details of the game mode have not been disclosed, but there are some assumptions that can be made based on the gameplay mechanics that have already been confirmed for
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . Should the reports of the game's co-op mode turn out to be true,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  would be reviving a game mode that hasn't been around in ten years since
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Unity
  </em>
  .

  Assassin's Creed Hasn't Featured Co-op Since Assassin's Creed Unity

  Assuming the reports about
  <em>

  ' co-op mode are true, it still wouldn't be the first
  <em>

  <em>

  title,
  <em>

  </em>
  also featured a co-op mode where up to four players could explore the game's world together and complete certain story-driven missions. It was possible to play co-op in
  <em>

  </em>
  either by matchmaking, joining a friend's session, or inviting friends to a session. As such, it's assumed
  <em>

  ' reported co-op mode would function similarly.

  Assassin's Creed Shadows' Co-op Mode Would Likely Allow Two Players to Control Yasuke and Naoe Simultaneously
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most obvious benefit to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  having a co-op mode is that two players would likely then be able to control Yasuke and Naoe simultaneously. With Naoe filling the classic stealth role for the game and Yasuke filling the action RPG role, this would allow players to be very strategic in their approach to certain situations throughout
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' world. In the game's default single-player mode, players are given regular opportunities to decide which protagonist they will control during missions, with some missions possibly favoring one approach over another. A co-op mode would potentially remove that choice barrier and see players completing missions using a hybrid of both styles.

  The main downside to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' reported co-op mode in comparison to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Unity
  </em>
  's is that the presence of two protagonists in the game suggests that there will only be room enough for two players to be in a game together, whereas
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Unity
  </em>
  allowed up to four players to be in the same game. However, the distinct playstyles of both of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' protagonists means it would be better for the game's co-op mode to be limited to two players.

 <p>
  Finally, another obstacle
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' possible co-op mode would need to overcome is balancing the strength of the two protagonists with their enemies. It would be anticlimactic for players to participate in a co-op game and very easily mow down their foes, with the two protagonists effortlessly overpowering anyone in their path. As such,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' co-op mode would likely need to scale the difficulty a bit to ensure enemies are much smarter, much stronger, and, therefore, much harder to take down. Of course, this is all assuming that the reports of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' co-op mode are true. For now, fans will likely need to wait until February 2025 draws nearer to find out.

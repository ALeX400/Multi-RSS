 <p>
  Throughout the
  <em>
   <strong>
    God of War
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise, Kratos has come up against plenty of divine enemies. Over the years, the games have seen Kratos face off against numerous Greek gods during his time in Greece. The original adversaries in the Ghost of Sparta's journey came in various sizes, forms, and power levels.

 <p>
  The Greek gods gave Kratos a tough time completing his quest for vengeance against the Olympians, with some of them coming extremely close to ending it all for the Spartan. The strongest Greek gods in the series are part of some of the most memorable scenes and boss fights in the game, while playing a significant role in Kratos' overall story in Greece.

  Gaia was the Mother of the Titans, and the second-strongest Titan after Cronos. She is the personification of Earth, and played a major role in the two games she made an appearance in. She is also the narrator of the series.

 <p>
  Gaia made some questionable decisions in
  <em>
   God of War III,
  </em>
  which ultimately led to her death. There are other gods stronger than she is; however, she was still a formidable threat that came close to killing Zeus and Kratos.

  Cronos was the biggest and most powerful Titan in both the series and in classical mythology. The King of the Titans had few rivals that could match his strength. He was able to carry the giant Temple of Pandora on his back for eons, demonstrating his massive strength.

 <p>
  Cronos' sheer size and past feats, such as killing Ouranos, made him a formidable Titan. The only beings capable of defeating him were entities such as Kratos and Zeus. However, plenty of gods have shown greater strength throughout the series.

  Thanatos, the God of Death, only makes a single appearance in the series. Hardly anyone dared to enter his domain, and the very few who did were unable to come back. Despite dying at the hands of Kratos, the impact he had on his psyche was immense, as he killed Kratos' brother Deimos.

  Even the Sisters of Fate, an extremely powerful trio that could control the fabric of time, had no control over Thanatos. This demonstrates his immense power as a being preceding the Olympians.

  Athena was one of Kratos' long-standing allies throughout his journey in Greece. Although there were Olympians who were stronger than the Goddess of War, she was still superior to Ares, the original God of War.

  Athena sacrificed herself to save Zeus at the end of

  , which allowed her to enter a new plane of existence. In her Astral Form, Athena was one of the powerful beings in the series. However, this ultimately corrupted her with greed as she sought to become the sole ruler of humankind.

  Hades was one of the strongest Greek Gods in the series, with only Zeus and Poseidon outmatching him in terms of overall strength. The God of the Dead commanded every spirit in the Underworld. Hades had access to a wide variety of abilities while being a physically imposing threat capable of killing Titans.

  Poseidon was an incredibly strong Olympian, with his power only being surpassed by that of his brother Zeus. He was able to single-handedly defeat Titans such as Epimetheus with a single blow. Poseidon could likely have slain Gaia as well, if not for Kratos' interference.

  The God of Waters was ultimately bested by the Spartan. However, it is highly likely that Poseidon would have destroyed the Titans' march to Mount Olympus. Kratos may have won in the end, but there's no denying the sea god's strength.

  Zeus is the God of Thunder, though that is only one of his many prestigious titles. As the king of the Olympians, he is easily the strongest god Kratos faced during his time in Greece. The overarching antagonist of the Greek saga, Zeus possessed unmatched strength that Kratos could only rival by wielding the Power of Hope.

      <title>Why Rocksteady's Rumored Batman Game Would Be Bittersweet If True</title>

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Arkham
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has been hailed by many as some of the best comic book-based video games in modern gaming. Rocksteady's work on the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  games put the developer in fantastic standing with many gamers, but the studio has unfortunately not seen much success with its most recent project.

 <p>
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  was one of the first major flops of the year, as both critics and players panned it. The game also faced plenty of controversy for seemingly killing off Batman and the rest of the Justice League. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  back-tracked on this decision, as a recent twist revealed that the murdered heroes were actually clones. This now leaves the door wide open for Batman to make a return, and according to rumors, that is the route Rocksteady is planning on taking next. Industry insider Nick Baker dropped an update that he heard Rocksteady's next project is a new
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game, or at least a Batman-focused title. If that's the case, the game could bring up some complicated feelings.

  Hopes For Other Rocksteady Superhero Games Could Become Lower Than Ever
 </h3>
 <p>
  Past job postings from Rocksteady have confirmed that the developer is currently working on a project, but its identity has yet to be confirmed. There has been speculation that the studio would continue to explore outside the realms of Batman's story, but the failure of
  <em>
   Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  may have caused Warner Bros. and Rocksteady to reevaluate the next steps forward. Going back to the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series may be too obvious of a move, but it would be one of the safest available.

 <p>
  However, this potential preference for safety could also squash the chances of another DC superhero game being the post-
  <em>
   Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  project. In the past, James Gunn has confirmed that his DC universe will bleed over into games, but it's unclear to what extent. It's possible that the next Batman game isn't an
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game at all and is a brand-new series based on the character, which would be intriguing. On the other hand, though, with James Gunn's Superman film scheduled for next summer, finally seeing a Rocksteady-made game based on DC's most iconic character could be a strong turn.

     has many excited, but since it is a VR title, it doesn't have as wide of a reach with its audience.

  Wonder Woman already has a game in the works with Monolith, but its production has seemingly gone silent. The Joker, of course, has been a fixture in
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  and even
  <em>
   Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  , but a game from the Clown Prince of Crime's perspective is full of possibilities. Rocksteady nailed bringing horror themes to
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  , making a Justice League Dark game with Constantine and Swamp Thing another compelling option.

  Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  has hurt Rocksteady's reputation, but hopefully not for long. Even if the developer chooses a new
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  or Batman game as its next project, it will be a welcome return to form. The mysterious in-development project has yet to be confirmed, but there are already even rumors that it could be a PlayStation exclusive.

  Whatever hero or villain Rocksteady chooses to make the centerpiece of its next game, returning to a narrative-driven formula would be ideal for many. If the

      <title>5 Great Open-World Games You Cannot Buy Anymore</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Open-world titles are among some of the most prolific in the world today, and while some tend to stir a bit of controversy from a design standpoint, it cannot be denied that many exceptional games have given players immense, detailed worlds to explore.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":252} -->

 <p>
  However, while many open world titles are hailed as pioneers in the genre with meaningful content, some titles have remained a little more obscure and are unavailable to purchase today. These games might have had all the compelling content in the world, but they, frustratingly perhaps, can no longer be found through mainstream means.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Urban Chaos: Riot Response
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an obscure title in the already obscure
  <em>
   Urban Chaos
  </em>
  series. It cycled through several developers as they all steadily dissolved until falling into the hands of Rocksteady, a fresh company at the time, who took this on as their first ever game. While, best known for the Arkham-verse games, this title helped, back in 2005 at least, put Rocksteady and the
  <em>
   Urban Chaos
  </em>
  series
  <em>
  </em>
  on the map.

 <p>
  The game delivers a fairly expansive open world with a lot of detail — as far as set pieces and destructive environments go. This is probably a good thing, considering the player is trying to take down a gang known as the "Burners," who seem to be characterized by an unlimited supply of Molotov cocktails.
  <em>
   Urban Chaos: Riot Response
  </em>
  offers a solid action/drama storyline in a great, reactive open world.

  Games with destructible environments like
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  have shown the kind of potential this mechanic has in sandbox titles, allowing for a lot of freedom and interesting scenarios for the player to concoct as they fight through hordes of enemies or even against other players.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mercenaries 2: World in Flames

 <p>
  There's a unique faction and reputation mechanic that comes into play as the player sets up their own PMC in an attempt to get revenge after a job goes bad. On top of that, whole cities and towns can be demolished by the player's explosive force, making for a very satisfying sandbox-styled open world.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  titles were beginning to really pick up their stride by 2009, and putting all that momentum to good use, Ubisoft released their second ever spin-off title on the PSP.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines
   </strong>
  </em>
  played and handled like a classic
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  title, and it acted as a direct continuation of the original
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's story, placing it in an interesting little niche within the broader timeline and lore of the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series at large.

  Exploring the isle of Cyprus — an open world appropriately scaled down for the PSP — still retains that classic
  <em>
   AC
  </em>
  charm, and the story is a surprisingly intimate one with a romance at its core. The
  <em>
   AC
  </em>
  series frequently ranks among some of Ubisoft's best titles amid the more mundane open-world ones, and the spark in this little PSP title reminds players why — even if it's not available for purchase anymore.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Spider-Man: Web of Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a gem among not just open-world titles, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 era of games as a whole. It had just about everything one could ask for in a Spider-Man title, and then some. Trapped between the temptations of the black suit and the obligations of the classic suit,
  <em>
   Web of Shadows
  </em>
  has the iconic web-slinger fighting symbiote monsters across an increasingly militarized New York City, with appearances from a range of broader Marvel characters like Luke Cage and Wolverine.

 <p>
  Players could opt between the classic and symbiote suit, with the former handling with classic Spider-Man agility and the latter a lot more impactful with individual AOE strikes. The game's ending was even affected by what suit (and love interest!) Peter went for in the end, and many features from this title are being called for in newer Spider-Man titles. This is one of those games in desperate need of a refresh. It's a classic, hidden gem from a past era of gaming that fans of the web-head owe it to themselves to experience.

 <p>
  After what has felt like an eternity of waiting,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's long-rumored sequel has finally been revealed, but it may not be what some fans expected. Rather than continuing the story of Jin Sakai from the first game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Yotei
   </em>
  </strong>
  features a brand-new protagonist named Atsu and is set three centuries after the events of
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , at the end of the Sengoku period and the beginning of the Edo period. What's more is that it will take players "beyond the edge of Japan" to Ezo, in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, for an original story that may or may not be directly connected to Jin's.

 <p>
  Though it might come as a disappointment and a shock to some that the beloved Jin Sakai will not be reprising his role as
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's protagonist, this anthological structure the franchise seems to be headed in is arguably exactly what
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's sequel needed. In the end, it opens up what may now be referred to as Sucker Punch's "
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  " franchise to a variety of opportunities it might not have had otherwise.

  Ghost of Yotei Establishes an Anthological Structure for the Franchise That a Jin Sequel Couldn't Have
 </h3>
 <p>
  While it might have been nice to see Jin don the mask of the Ghost once again,
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  opens up the franchise much more than a direct
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  sequel ever could have. Were the franchise to merely continue with a sequel to
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , it might have permanently walled off its overarching narrative, preventing it from exploring anything beyond Jin's personal story and the lives of those his actions directly influence. Going in this direction could have worked for the franchise, but its future would have been presumably severely limited.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  kickstarting this somewhat unexpected direction for the franchise, Sucker Punch's
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  series could potentially become something more akin to Ubisoft's
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  has always given players the opportunity to explore time periods that are centuries apart from one another and yet weaved together by the overarching concept of a shared bloodline of Assassins, which, in turn, has allowed players to experience most of the series' entries in the shoes of a different protagonist. This has also extended the life of the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series, as there is seemingly no end to fascinating historical time periods, original stories to tell, and unique characters to lead them.

  Sucker Punch's Ghost Series Can Now Feature Multiple Protagonists, Time Periods, and a Much Larger World
 </h3>
 <p>
  With this new anthological structure now firmly set in place by
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  , much like the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series, Sucker Punch's
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  franchise can feature multiple protagonists, different time periods, and a much larger universe overall. In an interview with the New York Times, creative director Nate Fox stated, "When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves was, 'What is the DNA of a
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  game? It's about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan.'"
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  bears witness to this with a new protagonist and a fresh open world to explore, setting in stone the franchise's aim to transport players to a place rather than a person.

 <p>
  It's currently unclear where the
  <em>
   Ghost
  </em>
  series might go from here in terms of characters, locations, and time periods, but Sucker Punch reportedly already has plans for multiple spin-offs. It will be interesting to see if and how each of these titles connects with the rest, and whether Jin Sakai ever makes a return in some form or fashion.

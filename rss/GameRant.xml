  With season 17 live in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players are plowing their way through the challenges to unlock all of the new rewards. Seasons are still a relatively new feature, as there used to be a scoreboard where players had to unlock each item in order. Now, players have some degree of choice when it comes to unlocking rewards.

  While lots of players think that the best strategy is just to complete the challenges as fast as possible to earn SCORE quickly, there are a few clever ways that players can speed up the ranking up process. In the past, some players have been able to complete the season and unlock all of the rewards in less than 1 week.

 <p>
  While it may seem counter-intuitive, players should avoid completing weekly challenges when they are released. The normal weekly update time for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is Tuesdays at around 10 am EST.

 <p>
  While the challenges vary, there is one particular challenge that remains the same:
  <strong>
   earn a gold star daily challenge for 3 days
  </strong>
  . Every day, if the player completes all of the challenges (all but one for
  <em>
   Fallout 1st
  </em>
  members), then they will receive a gold star. This not only gives the player a nice amount of SCORE, but if the player completes all of the challenges for 3 days, then they will receive the weekly rewards for even more SCORE.

 <p>
  If you complete all of the daily challenges for Tuesday and Wednesday, then on Thursday,
  <strong>
   activate a SCORE Booster to gain a 25% boost to all SCORE earned for 24 hours
  </strong>
  . After activating the SCORE Booster, complete all of Thursday's daily challenges and all of the weekly challenges to really maximize the amount of SCORE you earn.

  For the first 100 ranks,
  <strong>
   players will earn extra SCORE for every 10,000 XP they earn.
  </strong>
  So, by using XP-boosting items, it's possible to rank up even after completing all of the daily and weekly challenges.

  You should also keep an eye out for Double XP Weekends as the boosts mentioned above stack with Double XP Weekends, meaning that you can earn more than triple the amount of XP that you'd normally be able to earn.

  There are going to be two Double SCORE Weekends during season 17. The first one will run from June 20 - 24, and the second will be alongside a Gold Rush Weekend that runs from August 8 -12. These Double SCORE Weekends are especially useful for players who don't have enough time to complete all of the normal daily and weekly challenges in
  <em>
   Fallout 76.

  Similar to SCORE Boosters,
  <strong>
   Re-Rollers can be unlocked by ranking up through the season or by purchasing them from the Atomic Shop.
  </strong>
  Players will also get free Re-Rollers to use pretty frequently. What these Re-Rollers do is allow players to Re-Roll challenges.

 <p>
  This is good for two reasons. Firstly, it's a good way to swap out any difficult or time-consuming challenges. Second, there's a small chance to receive an epic challenge when using a Re-Roller. Epic challenges are usually a little harder to complete, but they offer more SCORE.

 <p>
  While you may be tempted to use your Re-Rollers on daily challenges, it's best to use them on weekly challenges. This is because the extra SCORE that comes with epic challenges is much larger for weekly challenges than it is for daily challenges.

  For those who are willing to invest in a

   Fallout 1st

  subscription, one of the benefits you'll get is special SCORE Boosts. When unlocked, these boosts will give you a SCORE boost that lasts until the end of the season.

 <p>
  <strong>
   These SCORE Boosts stack with the SCORE Boosters that can be purchased from the Atomic Shop,
  </strong>
  making them great for powering through the ranks. There are a total of 3 SCORE Boosts that
  <em>
   Fallout 1st

  subscribers can unlock. They are unlocked via the season reward menu.

 <p>
  From rank 1, members can unlock a 5% SCORE Boost. At rank 39, you can unlock a 10% SCORE Boost. Finally, at rank 65, you can get another 10% SCORE Boost.

 <p>
  Unlocking all of the boosts adds up to a +25% to all SCORE earned. For players who don't want to purchase a year's subscription but want to get these SCORE Boosts, it's possible to just purchase one month of
  <em>
   Fallout 1st.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Jackbox Games
   </strong>
  </em>
  titles are getting a new launcher that will help to make it much easier to navigate through the numerous releases the series has released over the years. This should help to resolve a problem that many fans of the
  <em>
   Jackbox Games
  </em>
  series have with the current and ever-expanding list of games.

 <p>
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Packs
  </em>
  are major hits with gamers, providing a silly and irreverant games to play with friends. They're also some of the most versatile titles out there for playing with big groups and long-distance buddies, as gamers can join in using their phones, so every player doesn't have to own a copy of the game. However, there's a problem: the more
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Packs
  </em>
  there are, the more difficult it becomes to navigate through every title's individual minigames.

 <p>
  Fans have complained for a long time about this particular problem, especially when it comes to streaming. Every
  <em>
   Jackbox
  </em>
  game
  <em>
  </em>
  has its own selection of unique minigames, which is great for the variety, but problematic when players want to play one of the minigames that's not in the particular
  <em>
   Jackbox Pack
  </em>
  they've started up. Having to close out the game, navigate to a new one, and start it up takes time, and some fans forget which minigames are in which pack. However, Jackbox Games has now announced that it's introducing
  <em>
   The Jackbox Megapicker
  </em>
  to resolve this problem.

  What About Jackbox Players on Consoles?
 </h2>
 <p>
  While this news has been well-received by many fans, there is one downside. Only PC gamers will be gaining access to
  <em>
   The Jackbox Megapicker
  </em>
  . Consoles are being left out of the improvement, which understandably has some players upset. However, it would likely be difficult to implement this improvement on every system that the
  <em>
   Jackbox
  </em>
  games are available on. The Jackbox Games team will be holding an AMA about the new system closer to its launch, so players will be able to inquire if there are any plans for future console versions of the
  <em>
   Megapicker
  </em>
  .

  franchise is getting its first M-rated game intended specifically for adults, called the

  for Steam users.

 <p>
  Getting a game's challenge right is one of the most important elements of game design, and it's also the trickiest. Every player comes with their own skillset. Some players might have excellent rhythm but terrible aim, whereas others might only excel at high-paced action sequences but suffer during diabolical puzzle segments without a robust hint system to keep the flow going.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  That where adaptive or dynamic difficulty comes in. With clever lines of code, programmers are able to scale a game level's difficulty depending on how well the player is doing at any given moment. This way, the gaming gods can get their share of glory against hoards of monsters whereas newcomers can take the time to get used to the game's conventions.

  The difficulty bar in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
   </em>
  </strong>
  shifts on two ends. On the one hand, if Snake is doing too well or has devised an "overpowered" strategy for completing stealth missions, the game will fight back by dynamically adapting the soldier's tactics. For example, if the player has gotten very good at popping headshots with the tranquilizer gun, soldiers will stop leaving the barracks in the morning without their hard hats.

 <p>
  Suddenly, tranquilizer rounds lose their efficacy, and the player is forced to switch things up. On the other hand, if Snake keeps running into trouble (or gunfire) over and over, he will be offered the cartoonish "chicken hat," which dramatically reduces the game's difficulty but at the high cost of the player's pride. As a consolation to players who repeatedly struggle with
  <em>
   Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , it isn't that out of place, given
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid

  's wacky history.

  Being punished for doing well sounds counterintuitive for fun lovers, but the Difficulty Adjustment system is actually the secret sauce that makes
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  so engaging after the developers shifted the series towards a more action-oriented genre than traditional horror.
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  and its
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  have difficulty settings that change the game up depending on the chosen option, but there are also lines of code busily working away in the background, ensuring that the player experiences a constant challenge or, if they find themselves overwhelmed, time to catch their breath.

 <p>
  Perhaps realizing that many players quit out of frustration and knowing those roadblock moments ruin the horror anyway, the developers at Capcom made it so that fewer and easier-to-kill enemies would spawn after too many player deaths. Additionally, the player will find more pickups to help get them back into the flow of things after a particularly bad run-in with the parasite-infected Ganados, both in terms of mood and resources.

  While some adaptive difficulty systems make an attempt to hide the fact that the player is getting an easier or harder time, most people who have ever picked up any
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  game will cotton on to the fact that there is some background balancing going once they take first place, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart 8
   </strong>
  </em>
  is no exception. This is especially true against AI opponents due to "rubber banding," which is when drivers at the back start demonstrating impossible speed boosts.

  A race's difficulty even adapts in multiplayer. Drivers at the front will start gaining fewer useful items, such as bananas or green shells, while those lagging at the bag will increasingly gain the most potent power-ups, such as speed-boosting red mushrooms, stars, or Bullet Bills. This is to keep the race fun and exciting for everyone and to ensure there's always a chance for the positions to change, even in longer races.

  The few games that leverage adaptive difficulty tend to keep quiet about the swaying difficulty curve under the hood, in part to ensure that the player is experiencing the dead center of difficulty and domination (and to avoid hurting their feelings). However, Clover Studio's
  <em>
   <strong>
    God Hand
   </strong>
  </em>
  prominently displays the player's performance and current challenge level as a UI icon at the bottom left.

 <p>
  As Gene battles his way through waves of enemies, a dynamic difficulty gauges visibly shifts from Level 1 to Level DIE. At higher levels, enemies bring more devastating attacks, faster reaction times, and immunity to some of Gene's cheaper moves. As a counterbalance, they tend to drop more gold when defeated. This unflinching transparency challenges players to adapt on the fly and celebrates their skill (or ruthlessly exposes their weaknesses) with typical Clover Studios panache.

  Video games have the power to elicit a vast spectrum of emotions from players, and terror is one of them. There's a delicate balance between bending players with tension and breaking them. If players find themselves getting murdered over and over in a horror game with extreme levels of challenge, the sublime fear is likely to transform into frustration.

  's stress-tracking system (The Director) helps keep the player on the edge of their seat by going between three modes (Build up, Peak, and Relax), which dynamically adjusts how many zombies can spawn in at once.

 <p>
  Not only that, but "high-stress" players, or those who are struggling to take down enemies or have taken a lot of hits in quick succession, will have fewer zombies directly targetting them, with subtle cues, such as music stings, to let them know when the tides are changing. Rather than deflating the tension, it allows tension to drum back up continuously as if there's really someone behind the scenes directing. The gameplay is well-balanced and designed to always push players into difficult spots (with the ravenous walking dead), which cranks up the fear factor.

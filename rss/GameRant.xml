  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared their monster-themed Poke Balls with the community, inspired by Generation 1 Pokemon Koffing and the Mega Evolution version of Gengar. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fandom is rife with various fan art and custom merchandise catering to the pocket monsters spanning nine generations, and fans never tire of seeing these original creations come to life in impressive detail.

  Beginning in the 90s, the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  IP has produced several video games, a popular trading card game, and an ongoing anime, and the future of the franchise is as exciting as ever. Fans are preparing to welcome the next main title in the video game series
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , which has a rumored release window of Early 2025, and
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players have new Dynamax Pokemon to look forward to, arriving at the start of October 2024.

  Posted on Reddit by selarenfia, the artist shared mock-up designs for two Poke Balls inspired by Koffing and Mega Gengar. Koffing’s Poison-type Poke Ball flaunted the same purple hue as the spherical monster, carrying its skull-and-crossbones marking and geyser-like nodules that release lethal gas. Mega Gengar’s Poke Ball sported a cream and pink colorway, shaped like the Ghost-type’s body with pointed ears and bulky arms. The artist noted the items were around 10 centimeters wide like a normal Poke Ball, sitting on a slightly larger base for display purposes. The custom devices were an instant hit with the fandom, and they join another
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan’s Poke Ball designs based on Generation 3 Legendaries.

  The Reddit community was impressed with the artist's creations, saying the Koffing version looked like a “nuclear bomb explosion.”
  <em>

  fans have experimented with Regional forms of Koffing before, but the Reddit artist kept the Poison-type monster’s original design from the games. Furthermore, the artist said they had been posting a lot of Poke Ball designs lately, making new variants almost every day, and members of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  subreddit were keen to see more original artwork from them with the possibility of producing a series.

  Hailing from the Kanto region and notorious for being one of the spooky apparitions in
  <em>

  </em>
  ’s infamous Lavender Town, Gengar is a formidable opponent in battle, boasting effective abilities in its original form and its Mega and Gigantamax variants. For example, Mega Gengar’s
  <em>

  moveset is a force to be reckoned with, collecting a combination of Fast and Charged moves to keep any player on their toes.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Neva
   </strong>
  </em>
  , developed by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital, releases on October 15 and takes players on a journey of growth. Whereas Nomada's last game,
  <em>
   Gris
  </em>
  , was a beautiful, emotional journey through the stages of Grief,
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  is about the parent-child relationship as represented by the player character Alba and her wolf companion, the titular Neva. Throughout the game, Neva grows from a young wolf needing instruction and protection to a being capable of standing alongside and defending Alba. It's a beautiful concept and a beautiful game, and it'll be interesting to see how it vibes with players come release.

  Ahead of then, Game Rant attended a
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  event in Barcelona where, among other things, we managed to steal some time from Devolver Digital Chief Operating Officer (COO) Graeme Struthers. He spoke about how Devolver Digital's portfolio has matured since first signing
  <em>
   Gris
  </em>
  , how Nomada fits into Devolver's overarching mission, and the importance of art and places like Barcelona in game development.
  <strong>
   The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  We started with the five of us. We were five people for about three years, then Andrew and Anna joined, and we stayed at seven people for another two years. Most of us do quite a lot, but I was the only one in Europe of the original founders. I tended to do all the stuff over here, working with PR agencies and initially working with Sony because, at that point, Sony Indies was run out of Europe. It was setting up a lot of the really boring stuff like getting official publisher status with Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. I was somewhere between operations and PR, which is not my thing, and events.

 <p>
  Gradually, as people jumped in and joined the company, I could step back. I mean, I still get pulled into stuff. What do I do now? I'm officially COO, but I don't really understand what that means. I sign a lot of contracts...I think I might be the one that goes to prison for tax avoidance. I think I'm the fall guy. I suspect that I'm the fall guy.

  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  It was the first time we had a producer working in the company, so Andrew was involved and Andrew's very good. He's always going to get into how this game will actually come together, how it will actually be made, but what made Nomada interesting was that they were based on programming skills and artists. Sometimes you get game pitches where it's art heavy, but you don't see the mechanics of it. You can't see how that will actually become a game.

 <p>
  With Roger and Adrian being heavy duty programmers as well, their experience was already impressive. To some degree, it made perfect sense the way they were structured. It was at a Gamescom where they had a prototype for Gris. I think everyone who was around at that time said the same thing as soon as they saw it, and I was one of them: you wanted to play it.

 <p>
  Going from there, with games like Hotline Miami or Genital Jousting, there was a strong perception then that we were involved in games that were either very, very edgy or hugely satirical. If you look back at Devolver's portfolio back then, though, it was about half the size it is now, but we always had art-heavy games in our portfolio. Gris is the one that really elevated that side of it. Long story short, Gris is a game that we all wanted to play, which is obviously why we signed it.

 <p>
  Also, just a sidebar, Roger is a huge Barcelona fan. I support Liverpool, but we both hate Real Madrid. It's a passion people who hate Real Madrid can share, so we've always had that trash-talking relationship.

 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  That's a good question. In one sense, and Nomada is an example of this, the studios we work with tend to stay with us for the most part. The changes in direction have more to do with their changes in direction than anything that comes from us. Acid Nerve made Titan Souls and Death's Door became their next game. Free Lives have been prolific, and there's no common thread with the games they make like Terra Nil, Genital Jousting, and Anger Foot.

 <p>
  We're brought along on their journey, which is great. I guess, thinking about it now, we've started working with a lot of those teams when they were in their early or mid-20s, and now they're in their mid-30s. The maturity may also be a factor, having kids may be a factor. We're in the hands of the creatives, and it's worked out quite well so far.

 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I still go back and play Gris all the time; my daughter is a Gris fantastic. I play mainly on Switch, though. I mean, you're going to hear the Berlinists later on, but the soundtrack for me is just incredible. Ironically, my first real interaction with Nomada was a confusing one for me. We met via email and we were doing Gamescom, and these three people just turned up at Gamescom to demo Gris. I just naturally assumed they were Nomada Studio, but it was actually the Berlinists who turned up to do the demo. We got to hear their side of the story and how they got brought into the project from a musician's perspective and actually being encouraged to contribute to the game, rather than "just please create a soundtrack." I mean, for me, Gris is an artistic endeavor in the sense that it's an artist, a group of musicians, and a very creative team that leads this game.

 <p>
  Also, I'm a terrible gamer. It's a standing joke at Devolver just how bad I am at video games, whereas I can play games like Gris comfortably. For Neva, I had the chance to play it quite early on and see how it progressed. I haven't played it to the end yet, so I want to keep that until it comes out.

  No. Some game's combat feels like a chore for me where I have to do this to get to the next part. Neva hasn't felt like that.

  I definitely can. The heart of our company has always been Austin. A few years ago, we'd obviously all gone through COVID and that experience. Our company had also grown quite a bit, but we've never had that "everyone together" moment. We decided to do that in Austin, we brought everybody together, and we tried to keep it very light because we weren't sure how everyone would be post-COVID.

  Nigel and Andrew were working with Nomada and told us they would have something to show. We've got 60 people, I guess, in a big room, and they're very good at theatrics: "Oh, you know, we've maybe got something to show you." They showed us something very Work in Progress that would become the first trailer. Even though we saw it very early on, there were a lot of people crying. That would have been partly accentuated by the COVID experience and I think everyone was more emotional, but I'm pretty sure that most people were blinking back tears. I know I was balling my eyes out, so yeah, that was the first time. And of course, I don't know if you have any animals in your life, but the idea of animals in jeopardy, you can really relate to that. So yeah, that was it.

  This is a city that comes alive at night. The romantic side of life is how you imagine places will be before you ever get to visit. Paris is very evocative, Rome too, but Barcelona is a city where there are lots and lots of tiny little bars and cafes. It feels like there's always a conversation going on, but it only really starts around 10 pm at night.

  I mean, yesterday, a couple of British press turned up after long travel because of some issues getting here. I know at 6 pm they were starving. They wanted to eat, but no one eats at 6 here. You go out at 10. Dinner's at 9 or 10, and if you're in Barcelona on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, this place is popping at 2 in the morning. It's multi-generational; it's not just teenagers or young people. You'll see people of all ages and kids will be out, so I've always thought this city feels like an ongoing conversation. They love their football, but they love politics here. It's very political. It's very left wing, I'm very left wing, so I'm with my people. It's always had this artistic vibe with poetry, writing, film here.

  This fits with Nomada to me. I mean, I can't pull the two things apart. Nomada has always been here. The two things, for me, sit together, but you know if they ever move out of Barcelona, then I have to change my tune.

  This is nothing something specific to Gris or Neva, but there's something about how people play games and also how you have to take a break from intense games. I guess you can say the same in film, TV, and music. There are things that will actually get your heart literally pumping. If you do that for too long, you're going to wear yourself out. Neva is this thoughtful, gentle challenge. It's a challenging game, but it doesn't make you feel stressed. It just makes you feel really relaxed and is a good time overall, especially if you play with headphones. It's a weird experience, but it's very relaxing and gentle, even when there is this running tension because you're nervous about what might happen.

      <title>God Of War Ragnarok: Best Kratos Builds, Ranked</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War Ragnarok
   </em>
  </strong>
  has immense build-crafting potential with Kratos taking charge of the Aesir gods. With so many enchantments, pommels, skills, and other assortments of goodies to grow fat in strength, Kratos has the potential to be better than the man he was when he laid waste to the Greek pantheon, and perhaps the best Kratos builds in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  will bring back the essence of the Ghost of Sparta.

 <p>
  As Kratos battles through the myriad of enemies in the Nine Realms, it's essential that players have a selection of builds to choose from. Kratos can earn different bonuses from his weapons, armor, and enchantments, so it's best to look here for a set of overpowered builds in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  that will make New Game Plus a walk in the park.

  While Kratos doesn't want to be a monster, he can embrace the Ghost of Sparta for the sake of his child and to keep him safe from the violent and deranged Aesir gods that seek his end. Providing players with the God of Death build, the combination of items and enchantments will easily have players melt bosses and minor enemies with ease thanks to the triggering of Realm Shifts to slow time. With so many Realm Shfits and so many damage buffs, players will melt bosses. Still, there's also a risky element due to the Soulless Warrior debuff which will see Kratos take extra damage for 17 seconds upon Relic use. Still, with so many Realm Shifts, they will rarely feel threatened, but this all-offense and no-defense build is going to demolish enemies in the right hands.

  The God of Health build will be perfect for players who struggle to stay alive.
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  can be a difficult experience regardless of difficulty, so combining the right armors, attachments, and enchantments is going to allow players maximum efficiency when they enter into a fight thanks to the durability of Kratos' health, and the ability to siphon stolen health from enemies with a specific chest armor. The God of Health might require some work done to get all the pieces, but it can be an indestructible build in New Game Plus that can have Kratos never relying on an ally again.

 <p>
  Kratos has access to the Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, and the Draupnir Spear, which allows him to provide a flourish to each attack that ends in a devastating combo. Yet, there are ways to extend these combos, much like the classic
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  titles, which will see Kratos deal increased damage and truly annihilate any boss. The God of Combos build is best reserved for players who prefer going all-in on the offense, while still knowing how to dodge, evade, and parry attacks. It's a punishing build for enemies, as it will see Kratos return to his rageful form.

      <title>2025 Could Be a Huge Year for Skateboarding Fans</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Though they were once ubiquitous, skateboarding games like those of the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skate
   </em>
  </strong>
  trilogy seem to have been forgotten by time. Of course, there have been indie projects like
  <em>
   Session Skate Sim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skater XL
  </em>
  , but the era of big-budget, real-skater-sponsored, over-the-top virtual skating experiences has languished in antiquity, especially as
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tony Hawk
  </em>
  publishers EA and Activision have set their sights on different targets.

 <p>
  But that could be changing very soon, as a new
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  game is on the horizon, and the genre seems to be getting renewed interest from the gaming populace. The aforementioned
  <em>
   Session
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skater XL
  </em>
  helped remind both audiences and gaming companies of the power of skating games, particularly those leaning into complex mechanics rather than gimmicks or peripherals, and the remakes of the first two
  <em>
   Tony Hawk Pro Skater
  </em>
  games were a nice shot in the arm as well. As always, it's hard to say what the future holds, but there's reason for skateboarding fans to be hopeful moving into 2025.

  A Free-to-Play Skate Game Is On the Way
 </h3>
 <p>
  After a few years of solid marketing,
  <em>
   Skate 4
  </em>
  is finally getting released next year, albeit in early access. This new
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  game, stylized as
  <em>
   skate.
  </em>
  , has raised a few eyebrows due to its free-to-play status, with skeptics arguing that this shift could result in a tainting of what makes
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  so special. While it's always good to be wary of predatory pricing schemes like microtransactions and lootboxes, comments from
  <em>
   Skate 4
  </em>
  's developers suggest that these facets won't be too egregious, though of course only time will tell.

 <p>
  What will be important about the upcoming
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  game is its attention to detail as it pertains to mechanics. The older
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  games succeeded with strong physics and realism, and if
  <em>
   Skate 4
  </em>
  nails these elements, then it could be a wonderful and fitting return to form for the franchise. It will certainly be nice to have another proper
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  game on the market, even if its live-service elements change how players interface with it.

  A New Tony Hawk Game Could Be Forthcoming
 </h3>
 <p>
  Speaking on the
  <em>
   Last Meals
  </em>
  show, Tony Hawk recently teased a new game with Activision, implying that the once-iconic
  <em>
   Pro Skater
  </em>
  series could be making a comeback at some point in the near future. Hawk was tight-lipped about this upcoming project, simply stating that he was "talking with Activision" about a new game, so it very well could be a while before audiences learn more about it.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":372} -->
 <p>
  At the same time, the 25th anniversary of the first
  <em>
   Pro Skater
  </em>
  game is coming up, which could align with an official reveal. Recent moves from Activision, mainly the advertising of the anniversary on social media channels, have led some to speculate about a new project being teased, and while this could be another full entry in the series, it could also be a remake of
  <em>
   Pro Skater 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  , chasing the 2020 remake of their two predecessors. Alternatively, and perhaps more notably, Activision could be pushing ahead with remakes of the
  <em>
   Tony Hawk Underground
  </em>
  games, which would be exciting for obvious reasons. The
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2
  </em>
  remake was a hit with fans, so both of these options seem plausible.

 <p>
  However one interprets Tony Hawk's comments, it seems clear that Activision isn't done with skateboarding games just yet. The original
  <em>
   Tony Hawk
  </em>
  games were in rampant competition with the
  <em>
   Skate
  </em>
  series, so it would be fitting to reignite the rivalry around the time of
  <em>
   Skate 4
  </em>
  's early access release, not letting EA steal the spotlight. If this were to happen, then skateboarding fans could be eating good in 2025 and beyond.

  With
  <em>
   PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  and its mobile counterpart
  <em>
   PUBG Mobile
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  being some of the best battle royale games on the market, it makes sense for other devs and publishers to try and capitalize on their popularity. As a result, Garena and its
  <strong>
   <em>
    Garena Free Fire
   </em>
  </strong>
  quickly took the mobile gaming world by storm upon its release in 2019 - and it remains ever-popular to this day.

  Interestingly enough,

  does have a few nifty features that set it apart from counterparts such as

  and
  <em>
   PUBG Mobile
  </em>
  . For instance,
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  has the option to let players choose a character as a basis for their avatar, and this certainly adds a certain layer of flexibility to personalizing in-game characters. The following are the

   With the ESL Snapdragon Pro Series Season 5: Brazil Open gearing up to be Free Fire’s biggest tournament of the year, fans of the battle royale might be anticipating quite a lot of hype surrounding the event and any potential freebies coming their direction as players of the Garena title. However, players hoping to build enough of a skillset to go pro might want to practice using some of the game’s best characters - especially if they and their friends want to start climbing through the ranks in the battle royale’s high-octane matches. Some must-tries include a user of an exploding spider drone, someone whose full EP results in a more aggressive toolkit, a healing specialist, and someone who can constantly slow down foes.

  Introduced in the battle royale as a tech geek whose knowledge about inventions transcends even experts of the time,
  <strong>
   Ryden
  </strong>
  spent most of his life under the protection of his sister Suzy. However, his new gadgets now allow him to brave the dangerous battlefields of
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gameplay - all thanks to his
  <strong>
   Spider Trap
  </strong>
  . When activated, Ryden releases a spider trap he can stop within a certain period. Once deployed, the spider waits for an opponent who wanders within its 5-meter activation radius.

  Upon activation in the battle royale gameplay, the spider clings to the target and explodes - dealing -80% Speed and -10 HP/s for 4 Seconds. This trap-based bleed effect can be extremely effective as a defensive setup, especially if Ryden and his team prefer camping in locations. Ryden can also set up his spider near chokepoints or in areas where enemies can come. With the right baiting, Ryden can make quick work of slowed enemies who are suffering from bleed.

  Parkour girl
  <strong>
   Lila
  </strong>
  from La Luna City seems like a typical active gal at first glance, but her gameplay in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  allows her to be among the more tactical long-ranged units that can support heavy-hitting team plays. A key part of her arsenal is her Passive Ability
  <strong>
   Gloo Strike
  </strong>
  , which comes into play when she uses a Rifle. Hitting a target will slow them down for three (3) seconds, with vehicles slowed by 50% and enemies slowed by 30%. While the ability has a 10-second cooldown in between affected targets, Gloo Strike also has a nifty secondary ability: knocking down an enemy slowed by Gloo Strike will freeze them and give Lila a free Gloo Wall.

 <p>
  This multifaceted nature of her Passive allows Lila players to take advantage of more defensive plays in the battle royale gameplay. While the ability restricts players from becoming Rifle users, Lila’s long-ranged plays and the defensive perks of a Gloo Wall-heavy build allow players to rely on more precise gunplays instead of risky spray-fire builds.

  Beneath the mask of
  <strong>
   Kairos
  </strong>
  and his rather edgy skull-themed vest is a
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  character built to instill fear into his opponents. The gameplay of Kairos in the battle royale relies heavily on his
  <strong>
   Defense Breaker
  </strong>
  ability, where a Defense Mode Passive will constantly regenerate 2 EP per second and stop until it’s full. When this happens, Kairos enters a Breaker Mode, where all his attacks inflict 120% damage to the Shield Points and Armor Durabilities of the enemy team.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":957} -->

 <p>
  Such an ability can make Kairos an effective team leader to debilitate enemy formations. While Kairos will likely not see much use in the early stages of a match due to weaker armor and weapons, Breaker Mode will be quite important in the latter parts of the battle royale. When timed properly, Kairos can activate Breaker Mode right before engaging opponents - either breaking their defenses head-on or crushing them from the flank to secure the kill.

  While the aesthetic of
  <strong>
   Kassie
  </strong>
  as a character in the battle royale title treads the line between quirky protagonist and volatile antagonist, her gameplay in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  makes her a must-have for players who want to take support roles more seriously. Beneath her rather tattered trenchcoat and sporty interior is a neuroscientist with a particular obsession with electroshock therapy. This is reflected in
  <strong>
   Electro Therapy
  </strong>

  If players need more healing firepower, they can tap again (Focused Therapy) to restore 100 HP to the target, with the target auto-triggering when an ally is below 50 HP but at 50% less efficacy. Kassie’s healing-focused toolkit makes her an indispensable part of a unit lacking a self-sufficient support unit.

  Lifesteal isn't a regular mechanic in a traditional battle royale, making
  <strong>
   Orion
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  quite a menace to deal with, provided players know how to use him. Presented with quite the menacing appearance, Orion is perfect for players who love getting in the heat of the battle while the rest of his team provides covering fire.

 <p>
  Orion's specialty in the frontlines is due to
  <strong>
   Crimson Crush
  </strong>
  , something he can only trigger once he converts his AP into Crimson Energy. He starts with 300 Crimson Energy, and activating Crimson Crush costs 150. Crimson Crush happens in two stages: the first one is a 3-second damage invulnerability that also won't let Orion attack, while the second stage is a lifesteal that gives Orion 45 HP from the nearest opponent in 5 meters - essentially a close-range attack.

 <h3 id="orion-encourages-more-brutal-engagements">
  Orion: Encourages More Brutal Engagements
 </h3>
 <p>
  Orion's invulnerability-with-lifesteal forces enemies to either confront him to eliminate him quickly or suffer the consequences of a constant aggressor. The 3-second invulnerability secures Orion's protection against grenades, vehicles, and fall damage, allowing him to pursue enemies with ease. Triggering his lifesteal also forces enemies to get out of cover, forcing them to fight him. Orion users need to be careful with Crimson Crush's energy requirements and short duration, making him unideal in prolonged fights.

  This ability only triggers when Sonia catches a hit that ordinarily should knock her down. Instead, her Nano Lifeshield triggers an invulnerability state for 0.5 seconds before giving her a 150 HP shield that lasts for 3 seconds. This emergency maneuver must be maximized to kill an opponent, lest Sonia gets fully knocked down. Should she win, she gets 151 HP healed or the remainder of her Shield healed for her.

  Sonia: Get More Rewards Out Of Risky Plays
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sonia's shield incentivizes rushdown plays, especially when catching enemies off-guard on flanks or attacking them head-on. It's especially important for Sonia to get close to them before she triggers Nano Lifeshield, as enemies can simply run away from her and render her ability useless. The closer Sonia is to an enemy, the more beneficial Nano Lifeshield becomes as she can catch them much faster and kill them. Even if she gets knocked down, the damage she can deal here can be enough for the rest of the team to finish the engagement.

  A soccer star holding a gun and mowing down on his opponents is a crazy image that
  <strong>
   Luqueta
  </strong>
  conveys for
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  , and yet he carries a unique allure that just makes it work. Through his
  <strong>
   Hat Trick
  </strong>
  , Luqueta has the potential to become one the tankiest aggressors in the game. At its core, Hat Trick can give Luqueta a boost to his Max HP whenever he kills an opponent. This limit caps at 230 HP.

 <p>
  While Antonio possesses a similar ability, Luqueta is more useful as his HP gain stacks, whereas Antonio only gets his bonus when the round starts. This essentially incentivizes aggressive combat, as Luqueta can dominate firefights simply by having more HP in his kit. Ideal teammates are other healers, such as Jota that incentivize HP gains when using guns and knocking down foes.

  Luqueta: Get Tankier When Engaging In Fights
 </h3>
 <p>
  Luqueta can rise to the top of firefights when players use him appropriately and with the right team. Taking over duels and eliminating enemies quickly can help Luqueta tank the rest of the fight with his HP advantage. In the latter stages of the game, Luqueta can become bait or even lead the charge against stronger foes - potentially outlasting and outgunning them even if they have better gear.

  With
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  maps having a vastness similar to those of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's stages, it's unsurprising for players to look at a tracker like
  <strong>
   Moco
  </strong>
  and understand her potential as a scout. When unlocked, Moco's
  <strong>
   Enigma's Eye
  </strong>
  allows Moco to "tag" opponents she hits. This reveals their location for up to 5s, making her a force to reckon with as soon as enemies engage her in combat.

 <p>
  Should Moco complete her Awakening Missions, the Enigma's Eye has an Awakened form that boosts the duration of tags to 6.5s. Despite the 1.5s tracking increase, the vast areas of
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  can make this additional time valuable when tracking mobile targets.

  Moco: Never Lose The Enemy Location
 </h3>
 <p>
  The rarity of active trackers in
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  can make Moco an immediate asset to teams. Players who are able to unlock her can pair her with aggressive teams that can get relentless in tracking down enemies that Moco tags. Alternatively, Moco can also become the more aggressive tracker of a passive team, tagging opponents and assessing whether their destinations are safe enough for a firefight.

  Compared to other characters in the mobile battle royale,
  <strong>
   Luna
  </strong>
  is among the playable heroes with a passive skillset. Her primary ability
  <strong>
   Fight or Flight
  </strong>
  gives her a boost in movement speed and weapon firing rate when activated, incentivizing bursts of aggression on the battlefield. Hitting an enemy converts part of the firing rate boost into a movement speed buff, encouraging Luna users to become more mobile assets on the battlefield.

 <p>
  This toolkit can motivate newcomers to the game to learn how to be more aggressive in firefights instead of pushing for a more passive gameplay. Understanding how enemies fight in duels can lead to more skillful plays when using other characters.

 <h3 id="luna-get-a-much-needed-aggression-boost">
  Luna: Get A Much-Needed Aggression Boost
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's important to remember that Luna's movement speed boost is directly taken from her existing firing rate buff, making her toolkit a matter of finding a balance on the fire rate boost to hit harder and only going mobile when receiving the buff. This aggressive playstyle makes Luna an ideal teammate with the likes of healer Skyler or even the armor penetration of Hayato.

  Gloo Walls are an incredible source of defense in
  <em>
   Free Fire

  , especially since this non-damaging explosive creates a wall that gives cover against bullets. While this can be annoying to players who have to cross Gloo Walls to kill enemies, CEO-superstar

  has just the right tools to eliminate the competition.

  Courtesy of his
  <strong>
   Riptide Rhythm
  </strong>
  , Skyler can unleash a sonic blast that destroys up to five Gloo Walls within 50 meters. Not only that, but Skyler also gets 4HP back whenever he deploys a Gloo Wall in the game, incentivizing more defensive builds.

  Skyler: Defense Is The Best Support
 </h3>
 <p>
  It’s unsurprising for a CEO like Skyler to want to protect his interests, with his Gloo Wall-focused Riptide Rhythm allowing him to capitalize on these defensive measures in the game. At its core, his ability to damage opposing Gloo Walls while gaining HP from his own deployments incentivizes more proactive play. Skyler’s destructive capabilities make him a debuffer for the team, allowing his more destructive teammates to kill faster.

  As with other battle royale games,
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gives players access to a wide variety of consumables such as Med Kits and Mushrooms to give them a temporary advantage in combat. The thing is, players can’t exactly consume these items while moving around, leaving them vulnerable to attack if they eat these foods in the wrong places. Thanks to
  <strong>
   Maxim
  </strong>
  , players can greatly reduce this risk.

 <p>
  With Maxim, players get access to his Character Ability named
  <strong>
   Gluttony
  </strong>
  . As the name implies, this ability gives players an advantage when it comes to eating their consumables. When triggered, Gluttony grants as much as a 10-percent reduction in the time it takes to use Med Kits and other consumables. However, players need to be wary that eating still leaves them open to attack, something that
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodline
  </em>
  makes use of with health-restoring vampiric bites that also leave players vulnerable during the feeding process.

 <h3 id="maxim-smarter-faster-plays">
  Maxim: Smarter, Faster Plays
 </h3>
 <p>
  Courtesy of Gluttony, Maxim’s reduced eating time and Med Kit usage might seem counter-productive when engaging foes in the heat of battle. Maxim encourages more strategic plays - striking only when necessary and always having escape options. Maxim’s faster eating time should incentivize players to gank or score third-party kills, run away and recover, and repeat the process. However, players need to get consumables as a priority, as Maxim's skill only works when players have something to eat.

 <p>
  Intense combat is often what it takes to define a battle royale player’s strategy - are they more prone to secure safety by retreating, or do they take the risk and push for the extreme offense? In the case of
  <strong>
   Shimada Hayato
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gameplay, his gameplay approach encourages players to go for extraordinary measures, giving players the risk of being killed earlier in exchange for stronger offense - something similar to the aggression-oriented Shadow Royale of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  With
  <strong>
   Bushido
  </strong>
  , players controlling Hayato get a whopping 10-percent decrease in HP. In exchange, players can get as much as a 9.5-percent boost in armor penetration, practically encouraging players to go on the offensive whenever encountering enemies in combat. His character is perfect for players in love with aggressive approaches.

 <h3 id="hayato-pain-is-power">
  Hayato: Pain Is Power
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players who enjoy risky maneuvers may enjoy using Hayato’s Bushido skill. After all, at max level, he gains a 10% boost in armor penetration whenever he loses 10% health. Moreover, when Awakened, Bushido can reduce frontal damage taken up to 3.5% per 10% health lost, giving him some form of resistance. When played properly, a backup healer or support unit securing Hayato’s survival can transform the character into a juggernaut, piercing through enemy defenses and killing them even at the brink of death.

  Compared to other characters featured in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gameplay,
  <strong>
   Homer
  </strong>
  has a more sophisticated look compared to the more combat-friendly units. This seems deliberate, as his techy appearance is linked to his leadership in one of the most prominent tech gangs in Griza. When used in the brutal battle royale of the shooter, Homer’s
  <strong>
   Senses Shockwave
  </strong>
  can turn the tide against a tough opponent, especially against players used to the brutal gameplay of
  <em>
   Bloodshore
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  When used, Senses Shockwave releases a drone to the nearest opponent in front of Homer. Upon reaching the target, the drone releases a shockwave that not only deals 25 damage to the opponent but also inflicts debuffs. The target hit by Senses Shockwave suffers a 35-percent reduction in firing speed and a 60-percent reduced movement speed for five seconds. Despite its short duration, five seconds can be a difference between a team surviving or dying in an encounter.

 <p>
  Drone-toting Homer can use Senses Shockwave to not just deal damage but also reduce a target’s movement and firing speed. This equivalent of a pulse concussion should give Homer players enough time to either gain distance and escape or find a better vantage point to eliminate enemies faster. When used correctly, Homer can jump the gun on foes and kill them before they’re able to recover or even distract them long enough while his backup rushes for the kill.

  Sometimes, players in battle royale games need to play dirty to win a match - and a lot of times, this means catching enemies by surprise and killing them before they get to react. This can come in a lot of forms, such as sniping or even ambushing, but thanks to
  <strong>
   Wukong
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  players can get wild with another idea: disguises.

 <p>
  Thanks to his
  <strong>
   Camouflage
  </strong>
  ability, Wukong can transform into a bush for ten seconds but has the drawback of a 40% movement speed reduction. Not only that, but this also has a 250-second cooldown at the base level that Wukong can reset for each kill. While ten seconds seem a bit too short, players who love their stealth games know this is more than enough time to creep up on an unsuspecting team and introduce them to the business end of their weapons.

 <p>
  Using Wukong’s Camouflage transforms
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  into an item hunt game, albeit for the short term. Wukong’s Bush form can last up to 15 seconds, meaning players should use the monkey god once they spot enemies rushing in their direction. While the skill does come with a lengthy cooldown, takedowns reset it completely. When done correctly, Wukong can rush an enemy, reset his cooldown, and turn back into a bush to confuse their opponent’s backup or wait for nearby players.

  Shields and protections remain an active component in
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gameplay, with various characters offering numerous defensive approaches designed specifically to prolong their survival. For players who want to gain an edge against others who rely heavily on defense,
  <strong>
   Xayne
  </strong>
  is definitely the operative for them.

 <p>
  Key to her skillset is her Character Ability,
  <strong>
   Xtreme Encounter
  </strong>
  . Thanks to this skill, not only does Xayne get an extra 120 HP temporarily, but she also deals extra damage to shields and Gloo Walls. When used effectively in other games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , it
  <em>
  </em>
  can spell disaster for building-focused players. Xayne can tear through enemy defenses quickly and ensure the enemy cannot fall back to a more advantageous position.

 <h3 id="xayne-break-shields-for-the-team">
  Xayne: Break Shields For The Team
 </h3>
 <p>
  Essentially the equivalent of a tank, Xayne’s Xtreme Encounter should provide her with enough firepower to blast through Gloo Walls while still packing defenses to outlast the competition. Her playstyle relies heavily on cornering foes by eliminating their protective options, ruining their timing, and allowing teammates to finish the job much faster.

  Players of any battle royale game know that a throwable explosive can dish out enough damage to wipe out teams when used properly, and
  <strong>
   Alvaro
  </strong>
  and his love for explosives is a match made in heaven for those players. Serving as the game’s demolitions expert, Alvaro has the right tech to make sure that the player’s explosives are deadlier than ever.

  He does this through his
  <strong>
   Art of Demolition
  </strong>
  , which not only gives explosives a 10% damage boost but also gives their explosive range a 7% boost. This increases the potency of grenades due to the ability to affect a greater area, making more offensive plays viable for aggressive teams.

 <p>
  Explosives become the best weapons in the game in Alvaro’s hands, especially when Art of Demolition not only increases damage by 20% but also adds 10% to their explosive radius. When used properly, Alvaro players will enjoy wreaking havoc on large battlefields, especially when players are at an all-out war to gain high-level gear. With the right teammates, Alvaro can enjoy a bit of risk while dishing out much higher damage with grenades.

  Created in collaboration with real-life DJ Dimitry Vegas,
  <em>
   Garena Free Fire
  </em>
  gameplay features a character known as
  <strong>
   Dimitry
  </strong>
  . While not necessarily a famous DJ, the world of
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  has Dimitry as a renowned sound engineer. Such was his passion for music that his sounds could quite literally improve the lives of others - something the battle royale makes use of via
  <strong>
   Healing Heartbeat.

 <p>
  Through Healing Heartbeat, Dimitry can create a 3.5-meter healing zone that affects his allies. Not only does this help Dimitry’s team heal for 3 HP per second, but downed users can use self-recover to get up instead of seeking assistance. These benefits can make Dimitri the perfect agent for a player new to battle royales.

  Dimitri: The Healing Aura
 </h3>
 <p>
  Dimitri’s chill white outfit exhibits calmness in the worst of situations, with Healing Heartbeat transforming him into one of the best support units in the battle royale. This skill’s 3.5-meter healing aura should be enough space to help allies get up on their feet with 3HP/s healing and free self-recoveries. When used correctly, Dimitri could be on standby with this ability in vantage points so much faster scouts can retreat for a quick heal before rushing back to combat.

  Aggressive players know that missing an enemy is an invitation to be taken down in a fierce counterattack, so players on the offense are always on the prowl for moving opponents.

  She does this courtesy of the
  <strong>
   Tracing Step

  ability, which gives her a 50-meter radius that pings all opponents who aren’t in squat or prone positions. This is nifty for an aggressive team, as Clu can pinpoint where enemies are roaming around waiting to be ambushed. She can also help augment the abilities of other recon agents by securing targets with her unique parameters.

  Practically speaking, players don’t necessarily need to be careful in a battle royale if all their opponents are dead - but this is usually a mentality reserved either for sweaty players or extremely aggressive ones. Thankfully,
  <strong>
   Jota

  can help make this playstyle extremely viable since his gameplay essentially encourages mayhem over caution.

  It’s thanks to his
  <strong>
   Sustained Raid
  </strong>
  that all of this is possible, as it allows him to gain a small amount of HP whenever he shoots down an enemy. Not only does this incentivize proper aim, but it also encourages extremely risky - yet rewarding and fun - gameplay strategies, such as third-partying an ongoing firefight or outright ambushing foes. After all, gaining health after shooting an enemy is an instant reward.

  Jota: Essential Lifesteal
 </h3>
 <p>
  Thanks to Sustain Rounds, Jota becomes a highly recommended offensive character in
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  . Inspired by Joe Taslim, Jota’s combat-oriented ability will recover HP based on damage dealt and knockdowns. This straightforward buff encourages players to become more aggressive, especially since hits recover their HP. When done correctly, surprise attacks from Jota should net him easy kills and free recovery without taking in much damage.

  It’s the concept of EPs that makes
  <em>
   Free Fire
  </em>
  wildly different from other battle royales, especially since this allows players to use EP to heal HP without needing recovery items - provided they earn enough EP, that is. Not a lot of characters can augment the way EP works in the game except for
  <strong>
   Captain Booyah
  </strong>
  , whose abilities maximize EP-to-HP recovery.

  Thanks to his
  <strong>
   Master Of All
  </strong>
  ability, his EP total gets 50 more points, allowing him to raise his EP to as much as 250. Not only that, but he can also switch between two modes to boost EP potency in a variety of ways. Under his Jiu-Jitsu Mode, all allies within six meters get a 500% boost in EP conversion rate. Meanwhile, he can heal as much as 3 EP per second through Psychological Mode, allowing him to constantly stock up on EP.

  Captain Booyah: Energy Is Key
 </h3>
 <p>
  When players use K or Captain Booyah, they obtain one of the best medics in the game. Instead of outright healing allies, Captain Booyah’s Master of All gets constant EP Conversion while K himself can enjoy faster EP Recovery or higher Max EP. Master of All, coming in three sub-skills, allows players to hyper-optimize K’s gameplay, letting him become a self-sufficient one-man army or an effective medic.

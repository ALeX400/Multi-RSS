  There are a lot of ways to make Henry stronger in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  ; though there isn't a single leveling system that makes him stronger across the board with each level. While he does have one overall Master Level, that is determined by the XP earned while trying to level up his base stats.

  The four base stats are Strength, Agility, Vitality, and Speech, with each one getting XP and leveling up at their own rate. Each skill earns XP in different ways, and leveling up a specific stat will give you access to new perks to unlock; here's how to gain XP in each one.

  Strength is the most straightforward skill, in that it is leveled up mostly through combat. To get more XP in strength in combat,
  <strong>
   fight with a bigger, two-handed weapon
  </strong>
  while wearing heavy armor. No matter what weapon you choose to use, make sure they have a high Strength level seen in the inventory to get more XP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your Strength effects:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Melee weapon damage.
  </li>
  <li>
   Unarmed attack damage.
  </li>
  <li>
   Carry capacity.
  </li>
  <li>
   Bow strength and distance by pulling the string further back.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your speed and overall ability to fight while wearing heavy armor.

  Agility is leveled up through the other side of the coin when it comes to combat, with weapons and an overall style that favors speed. Usually, smaller weapons will give you more XP in Agility, while stealing near enemies also gives a lot of XP. It's best to
  <strong>
   use one-handed swords or daggers in combat
  </strong>
  and try to dodge more often than parry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your Agility effects:
 </p>
 <ul>

  The most straightforward way to gain XP in Vitality is by
  <strong>
   sprinting everywhere you go
  </strong>
  . Using up your stamina in any way, especially in combat, will give you a steady amount of XP. Also, be sure to jump and vault over obstacles as often as you can. Landing combos in combat is also great for vitality, though that will require a mastery of the combat system.
 </p>

  Your Vitality effects:
 </p>
 <ul>

  Speech is arguably the hardest to level up simply because you only gain experience during certain conversations that
  <strong>
   require speech checks
  </strong>
  . There are a huge number of these conversations, specifically surrounding the main story and side quests. You can also read books to give some XP, but successfully passing speech checks is always best.
 </p>

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   How likely you are in succeeding in speech checks
  </li>
  <li>
   How successful you are in haggling.

  Driving at over 200 miles per hour in a barely legal street car while struggling to avoid busy traffic is what modern racing games are all about. Racing games of the current generation have evolved substantially since the genre's inception. Players can change gears using manual or automatic transmissions and upgrade the parts of vehicles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players don't have to be a gearhead to appreciate the nuances of racing games, either. Whether they are visual or performance upgrades, vehicle customization is a subtle detail that enhances racing noticeably. As an often underutilized feature, vehicle upgrading provides seemingly boundless potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated February 6, 2025 by Vlad Mazanko:
   </strong>
   Since extensive car customization became a staple of the racing genre, car enthusiasts have come to expect it in every new racing game, whether arcade-style, realistic, or open-world. For the most part, developers have worked to meet these expectations, with nearly every modern racing game offering some level of customization, both performance-based and visual. These options range from minor tweaks, such as changing rims or adding unique vinyls, to more significant modifications like full widebody kits.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Each year, car customization reaches new heights, providing players with unprecedented flexibility across hundreds of in-game vehicles. To make it easier to find the best racing games with deep performance and visual customization, this list has been updated to include more recent and previously overlooked titles that meet these criteria. Additionally, image galleries have been added, and the list has been
   <strong>
    reorganized chronologically
   </strong>
   , starting with the most recent releases.

  Still in Early Access,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tokyo Xtreme Racer
   </em>
  </strong>
  has already gained recognition among car enthusiasts and tuning fans. As the latest entry in the long-running
  <em>
   Shutokō Battle
  </em>
  series, first introduced in 1994, this marks the franchise's first new release in 19 years (excluding mobile titles). It brings back everything fans love: intense racing on Tokyo highways, unique Spirit Point Battles, a flexible progression and perk system, signature handling, and rivals with distinctive cars and bold driving styles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike some racing games with extensive customization,
  <em>
   Tokyo Xtreme Racer
  </em>
  features real-life licensed cars and parts. While its customization options are somewhat barebones at this stage, there's strong potential for visual tuning to expand in future updates. Given that the game launched just weeks ago, players can expect additional content and improvements in the coming months.

  may not blow players away with its performance or customization systems, but there's still some fun to be had in the game's garage. While it includes a fairly wide selection of vehicles, players can upgrade power levels by tweaking engine or transmission parts, pushing some stock models to absurd power levels on par with high-performance supercars.

 <p>
  In terms of visual customization,
  <em>
   Solar Crown

  aligns with previous

    The Crew Motorfest

  </strong>
  is the natural evolution of
  <em>
   The Crew 2

  , sharing many vehicles and upgrades with the previous entry. Players of
  <em>
   The Crew 2
  </em>
  can even transfer their owned car roster into
  <em>
   Motorfest
  </em>
  , starting their adventure in O'ahu, Hawaii, with dozens of rides in their garage. In terms of car customization, both Ubisoft titles are almost identical, although
  <em>
   Motorfest
  </em>
  expands the available vehicle and upgrade part list for players to unlock, purchase, and tweak.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a fresh, exotic setting and tons of thematic racing playlists to accomplish,
  <em>
   The Crew Motorfest
  </em>
  further blurs the line between
  <em>
   The Crew

  and the
  <em>
   Forza Horizon

  When it comes to realistic racing experiences, few games can compare to
  <strong>
   <em>
    F1 23
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Granted, this realism can be a little restrictive in some respects, and many will prefer racing on streets rather than on tracks. If neither of these things is a deal-breaker, however, then racing game fans would do well to check the game out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the racing itself, customization in
  <em>
   F1 23
  </em>
  is a lot more grounded than in other racing games, with far more emphasis placed on performance than visual modifications. Selecting the right engine, tires, and turbocharger can make a huge difference to how a car drives and will be essential for those hoping to consistently finish on the podium.

   <em>
    Need For Speed Unbound
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latest installment in the iconic series that all but pioneered visual car customization in gaming, and
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  is potentially one of the best in the series in this regard. From swapping engines to several exotic widebody kits that can transform one's ride beyond recognition, it is a great title for players who want to spend hours in their garage tweaking every little detail of their vehicle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  also greatly benefits from Criterion's dedication to making it a true live-service racing title that receives constant content updates, adding new cars to the roster and entirely new racing disciplines like drift and fan-favorite drag events for players to enjoy. Add the anime-infused visual style of the game that cannot be mistaken for any other game on this list, and fans have a
  <em>
   Need for Speed
  </em>
  game that represents a much-awaited step in the right direction for the series.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Gran Turismo
  </em>
  series styles itself more as a driving simulator than a racing game these days, though that's not to say that there isn't still plenty of racing to be done. The series' most recent installment,
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  , also places a lot of emphasis on tuning, with players able to tweak and tailor both the appearance of their cars and their performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, upgrading cars in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gran Turismo 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  can be incredibly expensive, with tire sets often costing more than an entirely new vehicle. Still, for those who want complete control over just about every single aspect of their rides, few games are better. The fact that there are more than 500 cars to choose from certainly helps, as does the ability to create and share custom decals and liveries.

  Where the
  <em>
   Gran Turismo
  </em>
  series strives for realism, the
  <em>
   Forza Horizon
  </em>
  franchise is geared more toward fun, and that's certainly something that racing game fans can expect to find in abundance while playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Forza Horizon 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The game features hours and hours of entertaining activities with which to keep players busy, one of which is its extensive set of vehicle customization options, including spectacular wide body kits by real-life manufacturers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  places more emphasis on how the cars look rather than how they drive. Creating and sharing liveries feels a lot more intuitive, and the bright and vibrant visuals of the game allow the wide variety of paint types and colors to shine. Of course, there are some mechanical upgrades available as well, but it's the surface-level alterations that take center stage here.

  Photorealistic graphics ensure that players have an immersive experience while playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Car Mechanic Simulator 2021
   </em>
  </strong>
  . As the name might suggest, the game allows players to test their skills as a mechanic while also serving as a highly detailed and incredibly enjoyable racing simulation game.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a multi-level garage at their disposal, players won't need to worry about having space for their vehicles and can instead focus on getting their hands dirty. They'll need to repair and customize their vehicles and are given access to over one thousand parts to get them running exactly how they want them.

Players can share their favorite visual designs online, explore each other's creations in the garage, and check out top-voted custom variants.

 <p>
  In terms of both performance and visual customization,
  <em>

  </em>
  delivers a wide range of options, allowing players to transform cars into powerful off-road or drift builds. While it may lack the ultra-exotic body kits seen in

  there are still plenty of choices for players to show off their style.

  From a vehicle customization perspective
  <em>
   ,
   <strong>
    Assetto Corsa
   </strong>
  </em>
  (as well as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assetto Corsa Competizione
   </em>
  </strong>
  ) is a knockout title. It allows players to build their vehicles and tracks and even share their designs with other players. What's more, the customization tools at their disposal are some of the same ones used by the game's developers, which ensures that no design ever feels out of place in the game's hyperrealistic engine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The immersive racing game is widely recognized as being one of the most realistic racing simulators out there, comparable with the likes of
  <em>
   Forza
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gran Turismo
  </em>
  in many respects. Players come for the vehicle customization but stay for the robust car lineup and excellent racing mechanics, the latter of which is greatly enhanced by the use of a steering wheel and foot pedal.

  Rising high from the ashes of the old
  <em>
   Colin McRae Rally
  </em>
  series, Codemasters'
  <em>
   Dirt Rally
  </em>
  games are the cream of the crop when it comes to the realistic rally-driving experiences that they're able to offer. Few racing games require players to focus on physics quite like they do, making the series' most recent installment,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dirt Rally 2.0
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a great option for fans of off-road driving.
 </p>
 <p>
  Solid driving mechanics aren't all that the game has going for it, though, with vehicle customization also being incredibly important. Granted, there aren't too many things outside of suspension settings for players to tinker with, but getting this just right can have a huge impact on the way that a car performs. The ability to create and use custom liveries is also nice, allowing players to express themselves through their rides.

   <em>
    Forza Horizon 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has seen a spike in popularity recently due to the game being delisted from digital storefronts at the end of 2024. The game remains playable across PC and Xbox platforms for every player who owns the title. As a racing game,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 4
  </em>
  is almost identical to
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  except for the location but also features dozens of unique vehicles that still haven't been added to the latest entry and possibly never will be.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a title capable of providing both arcade and simulation experiences,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 4
  </em>
  allows players to fine-tune every ride, directly influencing its speed, acceleration, downforce, and handling characteristics. The visual customization aspect might not be the strongest here, with relatively few vehicles offering full widebody kit upgrades, but there's always the option to add more "Sport" vibe to every ride thanks to visual parts such as spoilers, bumpers, and rims. Not to forget the wide selection of user-created liveries available for every taste.

  Not nearly as popular as many other games on this list,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Street: The Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still worth considering for gamers with a passion for extensive car modification. While its roster of vehicles is limited by modern standards and consists entirely of fictional cars with some real-world resemblances, the game offers a highly flexible, detailed, and authentic tuning system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can build their dream ride piece by piece, using a vast selection of branded aftermarket parts. Another standout feature is the game's destruction system, which adds an extra layer of chaos and aggressiveness to races. However, its physics, graphics, and handling models may not meet every player's expectations. Still, with its strong emphasis on street racing and automotive tuning culture,
  <em>
   Super Street: The Game
  </em>
  is a worthwhile pick for arcade racing fans seeking deep car customization in an overlooked title.

  There aren't many modern racing games out there that aim for a pure arcade experience that is a ton of fun without worrying about the realistic side of things.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Wreckfest
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one such title that has garnered a loyal fanbase because of its dedication to making racing games with fun demolition and destruction mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Creating paints and forming liveries is pretty engaging as is, with the car's tuning being another avenue of customization as well. Players who form a custom car with a ton of love and care would try to avoid having their vehicles trashed... although that is easier said than done.

  As a startup franchise,
  <em>
   The Crew
  </em>
  didn't hold much appeal to the racing game community. The first title, in particular, often felt a little lethargic due to the infuriating AI racers that players competed against. Fast-forward to
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Crew 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , however, and the series is starting to look like a decent endeavor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can race using a variety of vehicles, including boats, motorcycles, as well as touring or F1 cars. The game also contains robust car customization, allowing players to change out body parts for better performance and add decals or vinyl types to improve visuals.

  As its name suggests,
  <strong>
   <em>
    CarX Drift Racing Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  is primarily focused on drift events, featuring a unique handling model along with advanced support for steering wheels and VR devices. Despite its seemingly niche appeal, the game has gained significant popularity on Steam, thanks to its accessibility for players of all skill levels, whether seasoned racers or drifting newcomers.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   CarX Drift Racing Online
  </em>
  uses fictional names for real-life cars, enthusiasts will easily recognize models resembling the Ford Mustang, Nissan Skyline, and other iconic rides. The game also boasts a highly detailed tuning system, offering a wide range of customization options. Players can modify body kits, individual parts, and liveries, as well as create and share their own setups and designs with the community.

  Much like recent
  <em>
   Need for Speed
  </em>
  titles,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Need for Speed Payback
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers a vast car roster paired with extensive visual customization options. However, the game introduces several key differences from its predecessors. First, nearly every new visual modification is locked behind a challenge that players must complete before unlocking it. While this adds variety to the gameplay, some tuning enthusiasts may find these extra hurdles frustrating when upgrading their vehicles early on.
 </p>
 <p>
  More notably,
  <em>
   Need for Speed Payback
  </em>
  features a unique performance upgrade system. In keeping with the game's Vegas-inspired, casino-themed setting, car upgrades are randomized and vary in rarity, obtained through loot boxes. While initially controversial, this system ultimately proved fitting for the game's progression, influencing mechanics in other racing titles.

 <p>
  While it doesn't delve quite as deep as some of the genre's other titles that dabble in customization, it does have everything that players will need to get the best out of their cars. The lack of bells and whistles may be disappointing to some, but those just looking to tweak their cars for maximum performance while adding a little bit of flair to the exterior will find everything they need to do right here.

  offers a complete package when it comes to car customization. If anything, it could perhaps be argued that more emphasis is placed on the customization than the racing itself, although some players will see this as a good thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The racing simulator allows players to add a great deal of customization to their vehicles. They'll be in charge of repairing the vehicle when needed, as well as tuning it for the best performance. What makes

   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  is easily one of Nintendo's most potent weapons in their arsenal, as the iconic series has been at the forefront of some of the industry's most incredible releases. But while a majority of the games in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise have been made by Nintendo, there have been a few special occasions that saw them loan the IP out to another developer, resulting in some of the most fascinating entries in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it was Capcom doing wonders with handheld
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  or Grezzo showing just how much love and appreciation they have for the series, some of the franchise's most outstanding titles haven't even been made by Nintendo. These games have done an admirable job at staying true to the core values of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  , while also striking out to create something unique, as other developers have used everything that makes the series so special in order to create their own vision of this legendary franchise.

  Conceived as a remake of the very first game in the series by Capcom, its development resulted in a duology that started with
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Taking influence from other handheld
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games like
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  takes place in a top-down 2D world with absolutely spectacular sprite art and feels like the perfect representation of what the series used to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  This incredible handheld action game showed outstanding care and appreciation for the series, as Capcom was able to capture the spirit of adventure and joy that
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  is known for wonderfully.
  <em>
   Seasons
  </em>
  formed one half of a terrific experience, as it pairs up perfectly with its Game Boy counterpart, offering a stronger fighting and combat-based experience compared to the puzzle-heavy second chapter. Both of the
  <em>
   Oracle
  </em>
  games are available on Nintendo Switch Online, making this remarkable handheld action title easy to play today.

  Over the years,
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  has cultivated an expansive genre of game known as Musou, generally referring to a large-scale hack-and-slash combat game with numerous enemies and characters battling on-screen. Famous franchises like
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  have been given the Musou treatment by developer Omega Force, but one of their best efforts came in the form of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity
   </em>
  </strong>
  for Nintendo Switch in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking place one hundred years before the events of
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  explores the time seen during the flashbacks, chronicling Ganon's rise and setting players off into a huge, epic battlefield that utilizes all the franchise's most iconic races. With its enormous scale, satisfying combat, and epic story,
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  is one of the Switch's most impressive titles and one of the most fascinating non-Nintendo-developed
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games of all time.

  Capcom had a solid grip on
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  by the time the Game Boy Advance came out, as they seemed to know what made the franchise tick and were able to create some absolutely incredible games, releasing their best effort with the series with
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  in 2004. Development picked up immediately after
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ages
  </em>
  , with Capcom wanting to explore a fairy tale story within the realm of Hyrule and introducing the Minish, also known as the Picori, and shrinking Link down to their size in order to go on a grand adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  is a charming, delightful game that also sees Link face off against someone other than Ganon, as the nefarious wizard Vaati serves as the game's main antagonist. Featuring one of the franchise's most incredible soundtracks, outstanding dungeon design, and a fantastic combat system,
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  remains one of the most overlooked entries in the series. It was recently made available on Nintendo Switch Online, making it easier than ever to experience this classic game today.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
   </strong>
  </em>
  was originally released on the original Game Boy in 1993, and was a historic release for the series, as it put a larger focus on story and narrative than any previous game had before. Link's quest to escape Koholint Island by waking up the Wind Fish is still one of the franchise's best stories, which developer Grezzo took to heart when they produced a full 3D remake for the Nintendo Switch in 2019 and captured all the spirit and warmth of the Game Boy classic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  on Switch makes use of a charming hand-crafted art style, feeling like an approximation of the puppets seen on marketing material during the release of the original game in 1993. With sharp, focused combat that feels exceptional, faithful recreations of the classic dungeons and an awe-inspiring soundtrack, Grezzo's work on Link's Awakening is easily the best non-Nintendo Zelda game, as it expertly brings a classic title into the modern era and feels unique at the same time.
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
  </em>
  is available now on Nintendo Switch.

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  has been a runaway success, proving that raw power is not the be-all and end-all for consoles. Through a combination of Nintendo's first-party games, a solid selection of triple-A third-party titles, and all the indie projects anyone could ever want, the Switch has amassed a stellar library that can match most platforms in terms of quality and quantity.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  are two of the greatest games of the last decade, and they debuted within the Switch's debut year. There is also always a chance that the best
  <strong>
   Switch game

  has yet to be released. In just 2023,

  Compared to the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, the Nintendo Switch's February 2025 lineup is relatively lacking, with quite a few major third-party games skipping the console. However, that does not mean players have nothing to look forward to, as the month still includes a handful of noteworthy Switch releases.
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  is arguably the month's biggest title, at least for Nintendo's system. Presuming it runs well on the hardware, Firaxis' 4X game should be able to keep someone engaged for months on end.
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  is still massive after all these years, and the sequel seems set to continue that momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered
  </em>
  should be interesting. Unlike its predecessor, this compilation will be covering three of Lara Croft's lesser adventures, including arguably the worst game in the
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   Angel of Darkness
  </em>
  needs to undergo substantial changes to be made playable.

  Maintaining the momentum of its predecessor, March 2025's Nintendo Switch lineup looks good so far and features an exclusive that should be one of the better JRPGs of the year.
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  is receiving a definitive edition, with the Nintendo Store description explaining that it will incorporate new story elements. While that is quite exciting, this spin-off is primarily known for emphasizing combat, even more so than the mainline entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, March 2025 seems to be defined by JRPGs.
  <em>
   Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster
  </em>
  should offer plenty of value for money, with both games being considered classics in their own right. If someone prefers a completely new game, they should keep an eye on
  <em>
   Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land
  </em>
  , and Gust's latest project is set to revamp the franchise's combat.
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire: A Lord of The Rings Game
  </em>
  is also an exciting prospect as a slice of life sim.

  April 2025's Switch lineup has barely begun to take shape, and it might be a while longer before the month starts to come into focus. Still,
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time
  </em>
  seems to be targeting an April release, and Level-5 has a good track record for the most part.
  <em>
   Mandragora
  </em>
  is another 2D side-scrolling Soulslike that looks very good.
  <em>
   Poppy's Playtime
  </em>
  should also make the jump to the Nintendo Switch.

  2025 has a long way to go before reaching its final form, and only a handful of months have any titles at all. However, quite a few Nintendo Switch games have announced plans to debut within the year, even if they have opted to hold back on specific dates. Assuming it comes out,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
  </em>
  could very well be the console's biggest game of 2025, and "the console" qualifier might be unnecessary.
  <em>
   Little Nightmares 3
  </em>
  will introduce co-op to the platform-horror series.
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mouse: PI For Hire
  </em>
  all look great.

  and
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>

 <p>
  In fact, this is what makes
  <em>
   Tyranny

  Though the original
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games rely more on player-made builds and aren't the most difficult isometric RPGs, they are known for not holding players' hands, offering little visual help on where to go to advance in both the main stories and side quests. In
  <em>
   Fallout 2
  </em>
  , while traveling through the Wasteland in search of the G.E.C.K., paying attention to dialogues is crucial.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is because, normally, it is through these dialogues that characters can figure out where they need to go for their next objective. Sometimes the details are straightforward, but other times, players must think a bit and grasp the subtle hints in between the lines to fully understand the information. This makes the game one of the most satisfying Sci-Fi isometric RPGs when it comes to exploration.

  Breaking away from the genre's usual format,
  <em>
   Planescape: Torment
  </em>
  offers a gameplay approach focused on rich, philosophical dialogues, prioritizing player choices over combat. Despite having lighter mechanics, the plot of this isometric RPG is far more complex, delving into existential themes throughout its narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  The choices made by players can be intricate and influence the development of the story, whether in a broad sense, altering several events, or on a smaller scale, such as how certain characters react. As the secrets of the narrative are revealed, players encounter one of the best stories ever crafted for an isometric RPG.

  Transporting players to an original world developed by Larian Studios,
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  is a game that manages to be complex in multiple layers, with good options for character customization and deeper mechanics such as crafting. Additionally, the game features charismatic and interesting characters that develop well throughout the story.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what truly makes
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  a hardcore isometric RPG is its combat. Not only do players need to position characters well during each encounter, but they must also pay attention to the surroundings. Enemies can use these to their advantage, destroying objects or combining specific spells to increase damage and the area affected.

  Though also based on tabletop RPGs,
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 2
  </em>
  is inspired by the rules of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, an older edition that is less accessible to players used to modern entries in the series, like 5e. The game's complexity lies in the system differences, which can cause some confusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, it takes time for players, especially newcomers to the genre or those accustomed to the modern entries, to get used to these mechanical differences, one of the most noticeable being the difference in Armor Class. These elements make
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 2
  </em>
  one of the most complex isometric RPGs ever made and a true masterpiece for players.

  An Isometric RPG Known For Its High Difficulty
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Age of Decadence
  </em>
  is an isometric RPG that stands out for its narrative complexity and freedom of choice. Set in a post-apocalyptic world inspired by the Roman Empire, the game offers multiple paths and factions, allowing players to experience different and realistic approaches, from diplomacy and political intrigue to direct combat, where every decision impacts the story deeply.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to its branching narrative,
  <em>
   The Age of Decadence
  </em>
  is known for its high difficulty. The turn-based combat is unforgiving and requires careful planning, as even a single mistake can be fatal. With no linear progression or "safe" quests, players must prepare for constant challenges, whether through strength, intelligence, or manipulation, making it a hardcore experience.

  Based on the tabletop RPG of the same name,
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Wrath of The Righteous
  </em>
  challenges players to face a large horde of demons through various battles that can test their patience. The game also features a wide array of classes and races, allowing for a unique character customization.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, even on normal difficulty, without an optimized build, players will encounter difficulties progressing, as truly powerful enemies may appear at unexpected moments. At the same time, because of these challenges,
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Wrath of The Righteous
  </em>
  is one of the best isometric RPGs for players who enjoy optimizing each character to overcome challenges.

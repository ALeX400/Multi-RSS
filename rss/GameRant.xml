  <em>
   <strong>
    Dark Souls
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the most important video game trilogies ever made, building upon the foundation of
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  and becoming a massive hit courtesy of the first game's unexpected success. Exploring multiple decaying worlds and battling against imposing bosses is a huge part of what makes this series so special.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's easy to see why fans would want to check out more games in the same vein, and the existence of the Soulslike genre is proof enough of this. If players want to enjoy some excellent combat, explore a dark fantasy world, or face off against larger-than-life bosses, then these titles will be right up their alley.

  The gothic and Lovecraftian horror of
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  helped differentiate this game from
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , even if the core gameplay loop was similar in many ways. Players explore an interconnected world and fight against nightmarish threats as they aim to end the Nightmare they're stuck in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , the combat of
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is meant to be faster-paced, and prioritizes aggression over everything else. While knowledge of prior FromSoftware games is valuable, players must discard the passive approach to combat if they're too used to staying behind a shield in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  .

  Before
  <em>
   Salt &amp; Sanctuary
  </em>
  came out, metroidvania Soulslikes were a novelty that indie gaming hadn't experimented with. In many ways,
  <em>
   Salt &amp; Sanctuary
  </em>
  opened the floodgates for this genre combination to dominate the indie market.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , players can pursue varied builds by investing in certain stats with the Salt they've collected. Combat is challenging and death causes players to rage as they drop all their Salt, giving them just one opportunity to recover this hard-earned resource before it's lost forever.

  If
  <em>
   Salt &amp; Sanctuary
  </em>
  experimented with the combination of metroidvania and Soulslike elements, then
  <em>

  perfected it. After all, there's a reason why fans can't stop pining for

  Hallownest is another decaying world with tragic figures that the player is forced to take down during their travels. Combat and rewarding exploration in

  are easy things to point out when highlighting this indie game's similarities with
  <em>

  Before the breakout success of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , FromSoftware experimented with another hardcore action RPG series. The
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  games may be dated, but
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  fans who can appreciate these titles as a product of their time will love what FromSoftware has done with this underrated franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most fans agree that
  <em>
   King's Field 4
  </em>
  (also known as
  <em>
   King's Field: The Ancient City
  </em>
  ) is the best game in the series. The verticality and interconnectedness of the world is something that fans of the first
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  game will appreciate, with combat design also being prioritized by the developer despite their limited resources.

  It can be confusing to recommend
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen
  </em>
  , especially since two games exist with the same moniker. However, as long as fans don't mind some uninspired level design, they'll love the innovative ideas of
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen

  Players who want to enjoy a unique take on Soulsborne combat that is slightly more forgiving will have a great time with
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  . Players must inhabit one of many Shells in the world that embody different builds and add variety to the gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the rigidity of builds in the
  <em>

  </em>
  games didn't sit right with experimental players, then
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  will be very welcome. Players can try out every Shell in combat and see what suits their playstyl. It helps that this Soulslike is notably easier than
  <em>

  , courtesy of a forgiving Harden mechanic.

  It was only a given that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  was going to be a massive success, given FromSoftware's mastery over designing rich and visually distinct worlds. The Tarnished will struggle numerous times as they explore The Lands Between, but there are always new avenues to explore for the player to get stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  This helps ease the repetitive grinding fans had to deal with in other games if they were too weak to handle a boss. If anything,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's freedom may cause players to get incredibly strong and take out any enemy standing in their way, which might be cathartic for

 <p>
  After the tutorial phase is over in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , fights against large monsters start becoming increasingly difficult. Players will need to not only learn the ins and outs of their chosen weapon but also understand what makes the monsters tick. A key piece of the puzzle for getting a fight started on the right foot is sneak attacks.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Sneak attacks are devastating openers to a fight that can immediately put the monster on the back foot and allow players to quickly build up their weapon-specific resources at the very start of the fight and even inflict Wounds if they're lucky. Not only that, but performing a successful sneak attack is the only way to obtain the Hunter-Assassin trophy. Here is how they work.

  There are two instances when the Hunter can perform a sneak attack on a monster.
 </p>
 <h3 id="at-the-start-of-a-fight">
  At the Start of a Fight
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sneak attacks can be used to initiate combat with an unaware monster. Take note of the monster's movement patterns and line of sight before sneaking toward it. Make sure it's facing away from you when you approach and that you have some sort of cover to hide behind for when it turns its eyes in your direction.
 </p>
 <h3 id="after-the-monster-runs-away">
  After the Monster Runs Away
 </h3>
 <p>
  After a monster takes a significant amount of damage, it's very likely that it will run away to a different location. After a monster relocates, it will lose aggro. Now, hunters can approach this monster stealthily, just like at the start of the fight, and re-engage it using a sneak attack.

  A prerequisite to a successful sneak attack is the ability to hide from monsters. There are multiple ways to achieve this.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Hold the
   <strong>
    crouch key
   </strong>
   and approach the monster from behind. Doing so reduces the noise you emit while moving and is required for a quiet approach.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Use bushes
   </strong>
   and tall grass to hide from monster vision. Pressing Crouch inside a bush essentially renders you completely invisible to all monsters nearby. Bushes you can hide in are highlighted with a green glow.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use a
   <strong>
    Ghillie Mantle
   </strong>
   to give yourself partial invisibility for a short duration.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has announced the Powerful Potential event kicking off on March 5. March's first event will introduce the first new Pokemon of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's 18th season, Might and Mastery, beginning on March 4 and ending on June 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  The season's debut Pokemon is Kubfu, which was introduced in Gen 8 with the release of The Isle of Armor, the
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  DLC where Kubfu plays an important role as part of Mustard's Master Dojo. This Legendary Fighting-type Pokemon has the form of a small bear with gray fur and two white ribbons of fur behind its head, which it uses to build power by pulling on them. Known as a Pokemon that trains hard, Kubfu evolves into Urshifu Single or Rapid Strike Style, depending on which scroll is used.
 </p>
 <p>
  Increasing the availability of Gen 8 monsters,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO will
  </em>
  add Kubfu during the Powerful Potential event, which will begin on March 5 at 10:00 AM and end on March 10 at 8:00 PM local time. In this period, players will find the pocket monster through a new free Special Research story, which will be available to claim from March 5 at 10:00 AM until June 3 at 9:59 AM local time. It's important to note that Kubfu cannot be traded, transferred to the professor, or transferred to
  <em>
   Pokemon Home
  </em>
  .

  Meanwhile, 2, 5, 7, and 10 km eggs will hatch Charcadet, which, for the first time in the game, can be shiny. A new
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Timed Research will be available, and completing the tasks will reward trainers with a Charcadet encounter and items. During the event, the distance required to hatch eggs will be halved. Trainers will also have one- and six-star Max Battles and one- and three-star raids to join. An $8 USD ticket will be available, with rewards such as two Premium Battle Passes and an encounter with Dynamax Kubfu. Completing Field Research tasks will give players encounters with critters like Alolan Raichu and Hisuian Typhlosion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Powerful Potential event is the first of the new
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  season, which has other equally exciting activities in store for trainers. One of them will be the Community Day featuring Fuecoco, the beloved Gen 9 starter, which will take place on March 8. Totodile, another fan favorite, returns for Classic Community Day on March 22. The month also features battles with Dynamax Raikou on March 15 and 16 and Mega Absol Raid Day on March 23.

  No matter what main weapon you choose to use in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  , you'll always have your Slinger equipped on your offhand. Your Slinger can be used to gather resources from a distance, but also in combat by firing different things at an enemy.
 </p>

  Depending on the ammo you have equipped on your Slinger, the effects will range greatly. While there are a few types of Slinger ammo to choose from, some of them work very differently than others. Here's how to get different types of Slinger ammo and how it all works.

  There are two main types of Slinger ammo to choose from, the
  <strong>
   permanent kind that you craft and the temporary kind that you find while exploring the open world
  </strong>
  . Found Slinger ammo is marked on the map with the Slinger icon that resembles a bow over three arrows. The color of the icon will also tell you what elemental affinity that ammo will have. Once you pick up any of these types of Slinger ammo, it will immediately be equipped and you'll drop any other type of picked-up Slinger you already had equipped.

     You can't keep environmental Slinger Ammo outside of keeping it loaded, so picking up another plant will drop what you have equipped.

 <p>
  If you do have a crafted type of Slinger Ammo equipped, and you choose to pick up an environmental Slinger ammo, your
  <strong>
   crafted Slinger Ammo will be kept in your reserve
  </strong>
  , though switching back to it will drop your environmental Slinger ammo. You can also get some Slinger ammo types from smaller monsters like at the beginning of the game.

  The secret Crowned Anglerfish can be found in the
  <strong>
   Abyssal Zenith fishing pond
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  . This pond is located in the third layer of Mariana's Veil, submerged in the ocean’s darkness and depth. Since it takes a good five to ten minutes to reach it from the surface (Roslit Bay), setting your spawn location to Challenger’s Deep (second layer) will save you a lot of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, hop into the ocean on the trench side, keep going down, and follow the blue and gray leaves—they’ll lead you straight to the Abyssal Zenith entrance. Once there, you’ll have to navigate through tunnels while dodging incoming anglerfish guards before reaching the layer’s surface and accessing the pond. It’s a grind to catch the Crowned Anglerfish, so changing your spawn point to Abyssal Zenith will make things much easier. And just a quick heads-up: You’ll need to complete the
  <strong>
   submarine Ice Upgrade
  </strong>
  to unlock this area.

  Unlike the Magma Leviathan and Frozen Leviathan, the Crowned Anglerfish takes the longest to bite. Even with the perfect setup, reeling it in is a big challenge. Here’s what you need to keep in mind before going after it:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Preferred Bait:
   </strong>
   Truffle Worm
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Weather:
   </strong>
   Foggy
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Time:
   </strong>
   Night
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Season:
   </strong>
   Autumn
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Resilience:
   </strong>
   3%
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Progress Speed:
   </strong>
   -95%
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  First things first, stocking up on
  <strong>
   Truffle Worms
  </strong>
  is a must. You can get them from Volcanic and Coral Geodes, but farming a lot of them individually takes forever. If you’ve got the in-game cash, it’s way easier to buy them in bulk from the Desolate Pocket and Traveling merchant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once it’s Autumn, use
  <strong>
   Smokescreen Totems
  </strong>
  to switch the weather to foggy and
  <strong>
   Sundial Totems
  </strong>
  to get the right celestial cycle. Also, luck is everything for getting Crowned Anglerfish in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , so stack as much as possible using
  <strong>
   Server Luck, Merlin Luck, and Aurora Totems.
  </strong>
  Even with maxed-out luck, you’ll probably need to fish through multiple Aurora Borealis events on a single server before hooking one. If you're short on currency, just hop into public servers with high-luck stats.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly, your fishing rod matters a lot. The Abyssal Zenith bestiary is full of slow-biting fish, with legendary to mythical ones having a brutal -60 to -80 Progress Speed. A bad rod will waste too much of your time (and luck), so here are
  <strong>
   some of the best rods
  </strong>
  for catching a Crowned Anglerfish in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Tempest Rod or Challenger’s Rod
   </strong>
   – Great for high lure speed, extra luck, and reduced progress speed.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Rod of the Forgotten Fang
   </strong>
   – After three perfect catches, it guarantees a Crowned Anglerfish instead of a Megalodon.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    No-Life Rod
   </strong>
   – Best for quick farming.
  </li>
 </ul>

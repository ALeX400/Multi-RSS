      Shiny Pokemon in the set are not available in Wonder Picks, forcing players to open booster packs.

  While unexpected due to the recent launch of the Triumphant Light expansion at the end of February and the datamined release of another set at the end of April, Shining Revelry took
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  by storm. This is because the set includes several critters and characters that had never been part of the game before, as well as the rare titular cards for shiny Pokemon. There are various shiny Pokemon cards to collect in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , and some of them may just be the rarest and most sought-after of the expansion. However, there is a catch to collecting all the cards in Shining Revelry, and players may have to open many more boosters than past sets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Genetic Apex was the first set in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , and it's still the largest to this day. However, with plenty of cards being added with new almost monthly expansions now, the overall collection is already quite hard to complete. Yet, many fans mainly play the game to crack open some booster packs and collect the cool cards
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  has to offer. When it comes to Shining Revelry, though, players have to expect a hard time completing the set due to restrictions on shiny critters.

  It's unclear at this stage if this is intended, a bug, or a case of miscommunication on The Pokemon Company's part, but the official
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  website lists shiny Pokemon cards in Shining Revelry as intended for the Wonder Pick mechanic. However, shiny Pokemon don't appear for players in Wonder Picks, and based on reports online (such as Reddit, Twitter, etc.), this seems to be a widespread phenomenon. It may be that shiny cards have a different rarity than 1-star and 2-star cards, hence why they don't show up in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  's Wonder Picks across the board. Still, it's bad news for completionists.

 <p>
  Completing all
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  sets is already virtually impossible for free-to-play players, but Shining Revelry takes things up a notch. By making all the 14 shiny Pokemon cards in the game unavailable for Wonder Picks, fans will have to rely exclusively on opening booster packs to get them. This means that it may be a very long time before players can complete the set, and it requires devoting resources to it rather than other ones, which is also problematic with the cadence of new expansions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can still spend
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  's Pack Points for the shiny cards in Shining Revelry, but non-Ex critters cost 1,000 Pack Points each, and Ex ones cost 1,350 Pack Points, meaning one would need to open 200 booster packs for a single non-Ex shiny or 270 for one Ex shiny card. This is incredibly grindy for free-to-play fans, and it makes it extremely unlikely to get all shinies without ever spending a cent. At the same time, Shining Revelry redeems itself with a free shiny Cyclizar promo and a starter deck (complete with one Ex card).

  Why Shining Revelry's Shiny Pokemon May be Easier to Get in the Future in TCG Pocket
 </h3>
 <p>
  The issue remains, though, and getting all the cards in Shining Revelry may prove to be an uphill battle. It's unclear at this moment if shiny Pokemon cards will be tradeable, as Shining Revelry won't be tradeable in its entirety for a month, but there's hope. At the very least,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  's late 2025 trade changes may make shiny critters tradeable if they are not by then. Either way, Shining Revelry is one of those sets where players can't expect to go in and complete it for free in a reasonable amount of time - unless the Wonder Pick issue is indeed a bug that will be fixed. For now, fans can hope that the expansion will be more accessible in the near future.

 <p>
  Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk is taking personal responsibility for changes to the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  soundtrack. Some fans of the original games from just after the turn of the century have noticed some classic songs missing from the soundtrack announcements for
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
  </em>
  , and while Hawk seems to have no problem with those songs, he was also the driving force behind swapping them out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the success of
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2
  </em>
  in 2020,
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
  </em>
  was officially revealed in early March 2025. Fans don't have to wait long for the remake of the pair of classic skateboarding games from 2001 and 2002, as the launch date is set for July 11.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first glimpse at the soundtrack for
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
  </em>
  came around the middle of March, as an official playlist on Spotify listed 20 songs that will be included in the game. Last updated a few days ago, that same playlist has now doubled in size, showing a mix of songs that were included in the original pair of games and some alternate tracks recorded by some of the same musical artists featured in the original pair. Posting on his official Instagram account, Hawk explained that he was the person responsible for the changes to the soundtrack, and he hopes fans will have fun discovering new music based on his choices. "So listen and enjoy the ride," he noted. "More to come… both old and new."

  While the game is being developed by Iron Galaxy and published by Activision, Hawk's name is the one in the title, and he doesn't seem to be above using his influence to craft the course of its direction. About a week ago, a reported last-minute roster change in
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4
  </em>
  was also rumored to be attributed to Hawk himself. According to a claim made on a popular skateboarding podcast, Hawk personally demanded embattled former MTV star Bam Margera, an expert skateboarder in his own right, make a return in the remake despite development on the game being mostly complete already. Hawk's reported demand went beyond reusing older content and mentioned getting Margera into a studio for body scanning.

  Unlike the soundtrack changes, the roster change report has not been confirmed by Hawk himself. Despite it being just a rumor at this point, some fans are speculating that Margera's alleged return could also hint at remakes of the
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Underground
  </em>
  series, in which Margera also played a major role.

  Now it's time to buy a pirate ship. First, you'll need a boating license, so head over to the ‘Activities’ tab and get one under ‘Licenses.’ After that, go to
  <strong>
   Assets &gt; Shopping
  </strong>
  and choose a dealership that sells boats. Now look for a pirate ship in the list. If it’s not there, just age up and check again.

 </h3>
 <p>
  Now that you’ve got a ship, start sailing and wait for a shipwreck to happen. It’s a random event, so it might take a while. When it finally happens, the game will give you some choices that will decide whether you will survive or not. We picked
  <strong>
   ‘Call the Coast Guard,’
  </strong>
  and it worked, but other options might save you too.

  Your Zois in

    InZOI

  can have different ambitions to excel in their in-game life, which you can set during character creation or later adjust from the profile card. If you've assigned the Neat Freak ambition (under Stay Healthy) to one or more of your Zois, leveling up their Housework skill is important for promotion.

  Even if your Zois don’t have this ambition, many of their tasks still need to be done to keep them happy and productive. A higher Housework skill helps them manage daily chores with ease and even opens up financial opportunities. For example, one of the subskills lets Zois craft homemade furniture, which can be sold for a good profit. For those unsure, here's

  The easiest way to raise your Housework skill level is by keeping your home clean. You can tell if it needs a touch-up by looking around or checking the cleanliness meter. Just grab some
  <strong>
   cleaning supplies
  </strong>
  like a mop, broom, or vacuum, and start tidying up. Do this every day to upscale your skill level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep in mind that each tool has a different efficiency and costs some Meows, so it's good to save up for better ones to clean more rooms at once. Players can also have their Zois
  <strong>
   do laundry
  </strong>
  to boost the stat.

  Over time, some electronics in your Zoi's home—like the computer and TV—will start to break down. If left unchecked, they could even cause a fire, destroying furniture or even burning your Zois to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  While you can hire a skilled technician from the Pocket Market for 100 Meows, it's wiser to have your Zoi handle the repairs. Not only does this save money, but it also ranks up their Housework skill, making them more skilled at home management. To
  <strong>
   fix broken items
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , just interact with the object and select the 'Repair' option. The more repairs your Zoi does, the higher their skill level will get.

 <p>
  Finally, you can upscale your Zoi's Housework skills by having them craft custom furniture. To do this,
  <strong>
   purchase a Furniture Workbench
  </strong>
  from the Build Mode menu and put it to use. If you're having trouble making furniture this way, there's also a
  <strong>
   custom crafting option in Build Mode
  </strong>
  that makes the process easier. The items you create can be used to decorate your home or sold for extra cash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a quick heads-up: if your Zoi gets uncomfortable, they’ll struggle with chores and
  <strong>
   won’t be able to improve their Housework skill
  </strong>
  . Thankfully, you can check their mood meter to see if something’s off and figure out what’s causing it. Most of the time, Zois feel uncomfortable due to hunger, so just have them grab a meal and then try doing housework again to level up their skill.

  Marvel Games has surprised fans with the announcement of a new game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Cosmic Invasion
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It is developed by Tribute Games, the same people behind
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge
  </em>
  and it follows the same arcade beat ‘em up gameplay style. As a result, it already feels like a throwback to games like
  <em>
   Captain America and The Avengers
  </em>
  or Konami’s
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  arcade game.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the announcement came a first look at the gameplay and the seven characters currently confirmed to be playable in the game. They not only look like they’ll be fun to play solo, but also for classic local co-op, allowing players to mix and match different Marvel superheroes and anti-heroes for dynamic team-up abilities and animations.

  Armed with a vibranium shield and super-soldier strength,
  <strong>
   Captain America
  </strong>
  is one of those characters who always seems to show up in Marvel games, especially ensembles. In
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  , he seems like the default brawler character who charges in and deals as much damage as possible, which is typical for Captain America.
 </p>
 <p>
  If allied with a range-based character like Storm or Spider-Man, he would be the ideal vanguard. It is unconfirmed whether Captain America can throw his shield, but it is to be expected since that shield is as deadly as any bullet or psionic blast. It would be criminal to have a Captain America game without his signature ability to ricochet his shield.

  For over twenty years,
  <strong>
   Spider-Man
  </strong>
  has been Marvel's poster child in movies, animation, and video games, earning billions of dollars of profit for Marvel and Sony alike. Similar to Captain America, if there is an ensemble cast of Marvel superheroes, there is a good chance that Spider-Man will be part of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spider-Man is shown to have all the staples expected of the character. He’s a nimble and agile fighter with a lot of strength and an affinity for implementing his web-slinging into his combat. As a result, he will likely be useful on the ground and in the air, able to swing up and take on flying enemies with ease.

  Despite fans wishing
  <strong>
   Venom
  </strong>
  would get their own game, they relish it whenever they appear in a Marvel game, from
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  to the
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  trilogy.
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  is no different. The character has gotten some of the most impressive sprite animations, taking full advantage of the symbiote physiology.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of gameplay, Venom is shown to be a complete tank that attacks and can hit multiple enemies at once, using its giant mouth and symbiotic tendrils. They may have more health than other characters, since they are known to be able to take on god-like beings and survive.

  From the movies to the video games,
  <strong>
   Wolverine
  </strong>
  is another icon of the Marvel lexicon due to being unlike any other superhero. He has been in so many Marvel video games that his inclusion in
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  is anything but surprising, as he is a violent character with a lot of anger issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his adamantium claws, Wolverine is known for his berserker rage and rapid attacks, which makes his name rather fitting. His gameplay is shown to be all about speed, slashing his foes for a lot of damage per second. He is also shown to be able to pounce on his enemies and impale them with his claws.

  The world is fortunate that Storm turned out to be one of the most caring and selfless people, because she is a powerhouse of a character, able to control the weather as easily as a person can blink. In the comics, she can summon lightning, conjure tornadoes, and raise a tsunami, which makes her one of Marvel’s most powerful characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  properly adapts the character with all the weather abilities fans would expect, combined with the ability to fly. Her flight can be used to escape dire situations while also taking the fight to aerial enemies, but thankfully, her combat is just as viable in the air to keep the combat smooth or help her allies from above.

  Of all the cosmic superheroes featured in Marvel, Phylla-Vell, also known as
  <strong>
   Quasar
  </strong>
  , is not who fans expected to be included in Marvel Cosmic Invasion. There is nothing wrong with the character, however. She is not only a fun character, but is also a powerful being with abilities that are on par with, if not stronger than, Captain Marvel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quasar’s addition to the roster enhances its diversity. Not every Marvel game needs to feature only well-known A-list heroes like the Avengers or X-Men. One of the standout elements of Quasar’s gameplay is her Quantum Sword, which provides her with greater range compared to most melee characters. Additionally, her ability to fly gives her superior mobility on the battlefield.

 <p>
  Video games and animation have been the only places that
  <strong>
   Nova
  </strong>
  has been able to shine, as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to bring the character to life, despite a lot of potential and direct ties to the Guardians Of The Galaxy. Fortunately, he is confirmed to be in
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  as another flying character who can charge in, using his Nova Force to blast enemies with a mix of melee and ranged attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is unclear which version of Nova appears in the game, as the comics have two popular variants: Richard Rider and Sam Alexander, each providing a different personality for the cosmic superhero. It will be interesting to see how much of Nova’s powers are depicted in
  <em>
   Marvel Cosmic Invasion
  </em>
  , as the character features regenerative properties and can perceive threats before they hit him.

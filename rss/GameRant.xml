  The strategy game genre is one that is broad and diverse, offering an array of experiences that vary wildly in complexity and challenge. However, some of these titles can feel like there's only ever one solution to any given situation, and when this solution becomes obvious, it can suck the fun out of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some strategy games, however, attempt to circumvent this design problem by offering players a tremendous number of approaches to take. Games such as
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  offer basic combat but champion player agency by providing a great number of options. Meanwhile, titles such as
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  provide multiple approaches in the form of numerous victory conditions.

  Arguably one of the most accessible roguelike deck-builders,
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  remains a strategic game through its diverse variety of potential strategies and synergies. Each run is made unique by giving the player a choice of starting decks, and this is only elevated by the random Jokers (passive upgrades) and distinct cards that can be acquired and even upgraded throughout each run.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  can begin to feel somewhat repetitive due to the simplicity of its moment-to-moment gameplay, a loop that's heavily based on Poker and score-attack games. However, the diversity of available strategies ensures the game remains fresh for a good while.

  This dark, Gothic turn-based strategy game is a harsh and unforgiving experience that not only offers multiple strategies, but encourages them. In
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  , players are given the task of managing a roster of not-so-stalwart adventurers and sending them into dangerous dungeons populated by Lovecraftian horrors.
 </p>
 <p>
  The end goal is to rid the land of these creatures, but the journey is a long and arduous one. Thankfully, the experience is packed with variety; not only are there a multitude of character classes, but each has multiple ability options and can even be equipped with a variety of unique items. Furthermore, only four adventurers can go on any given mission, meaning that players must frequently switch up their party and experiment with different strategies.

  is an accessible auto-battler with a truly elegant design that combines elements of traditional auto-battlers and games such as
  <em>

  . This results in a loop that's both simple and strategic, elevated by a truly diverse set of potential strategies and synergies.

 <p>
  In the game, players are given the task of building a small squad of pets, buffing them with unique items and doing battle in asynchronous multiplayer. The variety of pets and items, as well as the randomization within its gameplay, typically result in unique squads each match. Optimal strategies do pop up, but the game's weekly mode switches up the roster of available pets and items on a regular basis, helping to keep the experience fresh.

  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has found a handy skip at the start of the DLC that can quickly take them to Scadu Altus. While that area itself is not terribly far away, the path is filled with dangerous enemies, so this can help players reach the area within a matter of seconds after starting the
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's been close to six months since
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC launched, and the game is still shattering records. FromSoftware revealed
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's final sales number, stating that it sold a whopping 28 million units since launch. Recently, FromSoftware also announced a new game set in the same universe,
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  , which instilled a lot of excitement throughout the community.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  subreddit, user GPdevotion reveals an interesting path that many might've missed. They pointed to a faster way to reach Scadu Altus after entering the Lands Between which involves using the gravestone wall near the Church of Consolation in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. The crafty Redditor showcases a series of nerve-wracking jumps with Torrent, allowing them to traverse cliff. Ideally, these gravestone cliffs only allow players to go down and not up, but this trick involves jumping on rocks in between to make the skip possible.

 <p>
  A few Redditors mentioned that some speedrunners used this trick to reach Scadu Altus in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, which has sparked a debate in the community. Many are intrigued about how players find routes like this, considering their obscure nature. While some believe that it just merely trial and error, others think it also involves looking at the game's files to find areas that can be exploited for such skips. In reality, it's likely to be a combination of both.

  This is not the only case where players found something new in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  recently. For instance, one player discovered a method for defeating Margit in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  that was previously believed to be impossible, which involved making him fall off the cliff where his fight takes place. The fact that players continue to discover things in both the base game and expansion so many months after their respective launches is a testament to the community's dedication.

  There are a few different mission types that players can choose to complete in
  <strong>
   <em>
    7 Days To Die.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Some, like buried treasure missions, are pretty straightforward. However, there are some jobs that are incredibly tough to complete. As you progress through the trader tiers, you'll unlock tougher missions. Some of the toughest missions in the game are infested missions. Players can opt to charge into a building filled with all sorts of undead enemies and take them all out.

  To start any mission, you'll need to pay a trader a visit. On a standard map, there are 5 different traders; Rekt, Jen, Bob, Hugh, and Joe. For the most part, it doesn't really matter which trader you speak to. The things that do matter are the mission location and the mission tier. The higher the mission tier, the more difficult the mission. Also, the biome where the mission takes place plays a role in how tough the enemies will be. For example, a mission completed in the forest is far less likely to have lots of ferals when compared to a mission that takes place in the Wasteland.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Infested missions can be started after you have unlocked tier 2 missions.
  </strong>
  To unlock tier 2 missions, you'll need to complete a total of 10 tier 1 missions. Infested clear missions are considerably harder than standard clear missions. You can expect to come up against more zombies than normal. Not only that, but the zombies tend to be tougher zombies, like radiated zombies, cops, and ferals. Tier 6 infested clear missions are by far the most difficult missions in the game. However, by the time you have gained access to tier 6 missions, you should be well-armed and ready to take them on. No matter what tier the mission is, the objective for infested clear missions remains the same; eliminate all enemies within a certain area.

 <p>
  Once you have arrived at the POI (point of interest) where the mission takes place, you'll need to activate it by interacting with the marker in front of the building/area. Activating this marker means that you can't leave the area. If you stray too far from the POI, then the mission will fail. Also, if you die during the mission, this will cause you to spawn outside the mission area, meaning that if you die, you fail the mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every location in the game wants players to go a certain way. Inside each POI there are several trigger points. A trigger point is an event that takes place once the player crosses a certain threshold within a POI. This can be anything from the floor collapsing to a horde of zombies jumping in from above. To avoid this,
  <strong>
   take an alternative route through the POI.
  </strong>
  The way that the game wants you to go is usually lit up by torches, lanterns, or any other type of lighting. If you avoid following the designated path, then you'll also avoid accidentally triggering a dangerous trap.
 </p>
 <p>
  One helpful tip when clearing dangerous locations is to always carry a handful of building blocks. That way, if you ever fall into a trap, you can quickly build your way out of it. Also, you can use the blocks to hop up the side of a building, avoiding the main path, and allowing you to take the zombies by surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to any clear mission, as soon as a zombie has been activated, it will appear as a red dot at the top of the screen.
  <strong>
   The larger the red dot, the closer the zombie is to you.
  </strong>
  Using this, it's possible to keep track of the zombie's rough location, preventing you from getting overrun.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for killing the zombies, just like almost every other zombie-based video game, the head is their weak point. While a few cracks to the head are usually enough to take down most enemies, there are a few with special abilities that are worth keeping an eye out for:

 <p>
  When you get to the final room during an infested clear mission, you'll see lots of top-tier loot containers. While you are going to want to search all of the containers, you should also be careful. Most infested clear missions save the largest number of zombies for the loot room. Once you step inside, there's a high chance that you'll be swamped by zombies. Before going into the loot room/area, make sure that you are fully healed, your weapons are durable and reloaded, and that you know your way out. One key rule for survival is to always know your existence. If things get too dangerous, you'll need to get out, fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have cleared all of the zombies, your mission objective will change, and you'll need to report back to the trader to claim your reward. Before leaving, be sure to grab all of the valuable loot from the final room. One big difference between a regular clear mission and an infested clear mission is the loot.
  <strong>
   On top of the standard loot crates, you'll find an infested cache.
  </strong>
  This box usually contains enough ammo, magazines, and other quality items to make the mission worthwhile.

  <strong>
   Once you have returned to the trader, you'll be able to choose a reward.
  </strong>
  The reward you get is random. However, the quality/rarity of the rewards available depends on a few factors:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Game Stage
  </li>
  <li>
   Loot Stage
  </li>
  <li>
   Tier Selection
  </li>
  <li>
   Skillpoint Selection
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Your game stage goes up naturally while you play. While the same is true for your loot stage, there are a few things you can do to boost it. Lucky Looter is a skill that helps to bump up your loot stage. There's also the treasure hunter's mod that further increases it. As for your tier selection, the higher the mission tier, the better the rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The final thing you can do to get the best rewards is invest points into the perk A Daring Adventurer.
  </strong>
  This increases the number of Dukes you get for completing missions. Also, at rank 4, this perk allows the player to select two rewards instead of one upon completing a mission. This is a real must-have perk for those who enjoy completing missions. The extra Dukes are a huge help. However, being able to grab two rewards can be incredibly beneficial, especially if they are rare rewards such as solar cells, crucibles, or legendary parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  After you've claimed your rewards, it's always a good idea to sell any unwanted items you picked up during the mission to the trader. Each Duke you make in a sale gives you 1XP. While it doesn't seem like much, if you sell items in large quantities, it's possible to get thousands of XP with just the click of a button.

  One could argue that
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games live and die by their roster of playable Vault Hunters and the quality of the loot, as those can be the most appealing bits of new games and what drives the hype - and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  is likely to be no different. In fact,
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's Vault Hunters already received backlash for what some fans described as "bland design," further showing how iconic the four playable characters (not counting DLC Vault Hunters) can be for the series. With four main games preceding
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , now is a good time to look back and see where each of these playable characters is.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not all
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  Vault Hunters survived the events of the series, and those who didn't are extremely unlikely to return in
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , if not in flashbacks or maybe even lookalike NPCs.
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  can be a whacky series when it comes to its story and humor, so it's not impossible to see familiar faces in some shape or form in
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  - and some of them have already been confirmed by the recent trailer. So far, the series has amassed a total of 20 playable Vault Hunters divided as follows:

   4 in

   Borderlands
  </em>
  games that died. Shot by Handsome Jack in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , Roland's death was the catalyst for some key events in the series, but he is unlikely to be seen again in the future.

 <h3 id="brick">
  Brick
 </h3>
 <p>
  Alongside other recurring characters within the series, Brick is in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , albeit in a small role mainly dedicated to one story mission and some side quests. Still, he is currently alive and presumably spends time with Mordecai and Tiny Tina.
 </p>
 <h3 id="mordecai">
  Mordecai
 </h3>
 <p>
  Similar to Brick, Mordecai returned in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  for a short time. He tragically lost his trusted companion, Bloodwing, in the events of
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , and then came back in
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  with a new pet of the same species called Talon. Both Mordecai and Talon are alive.
 </p>
 <h3 id="lilith">
  Lilith
 </h3>
 <p>
  Initially presumed dead after the events of
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , Lilith is alive ahead of
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  and will likely still play a huge part in the events of the game. It's unclear if her human form has been changed after the end of
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  , but she is bound to make an appearance in the sequel.

 <p>
  Not much is known about Axton after the events of
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , but he does come back in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  's Arms Race DLC as a commentator for the reality show-like game mode. He is alive ahead of
  <em>

  </em>

 </p>
 <h3 id="salvador">
  Salvador
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the same spot as Axton is
  <em>

  's Salvador. Another of the main four Vault Hunters in the game, Salvador shares the stage with Axton in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  as an ECHO caster in the Arms Race DLC, and is currently alive.
 </p>
 <h3 id="zer0">
  Zer0
 </h3>
 <p>
  Zer0's role in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  is not as small as other recurring characters, and he is involved with the Maliwan vs. Atlas plotline. Despite the boss fight eerily resembling Zer0 in
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  , he is alive and still serves under Atlas.
 </p>
 <h3 id="maya">
  Maya
 </h3>
 <p>
  Maya died in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  in what some fans label as Ava's fault. Ava is a Siren in training in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , and she inherits Maya's powers after the Calipso Twins are defeated. Since Maya met her demise, she most likely won't be seen in Borderlands 4.
 </p>
 <h3 id="gaige">
  Gaige

 <p>
  The first DLC Vault Hunter in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games alongside Krieg, Gaige came back in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  for the Guns, Love, and Tentacles DLC. Like most past Vault Hunters who came back in
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  , she is alive at the end of the DLC.
 </p>
 <h3 id="krieg">
  Krieg
 </h3>
 <p>
  The playable Psycho Krieg got his own DLC in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , which is dedicated to him dealing with the aftermath of Maya's death. With the sad and yet humorous nature of the DLC, Krieg is still alive at the end of it.

 <h3 id="nisha">

  and
  <em>
   BL4

  are unknown, but they are presumed alive.
 </p>
 <h3 id="moze">

 <p>
  Last but not least, Moze shares the same fate as Amara and FL4K, as she was playable in

  Thankfully there are plenty of fun and immersive games online that can help both beginner and more experienced players make some new virtual friends. From fantasy, sim, and action to FPS online games players can get lost in all kinds of thrilling worlds while making friends and improving their gaming skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some of these games, players can join clans and meet lots of people at once and get guidance or simply have some fun together. However, there are some excellent options for introverts too who prefer to play and communicate with only one other gamer. They can too find breathtaking online open-world games and sharpen their gaming skills during online co-op adventures. Unfortunately, there are quite a few gamers who have to deal with toxic players online, but there are also plenty of really chill and kind players and communities who are always welcoming toward newbies.

   Online games are more than just a hobby to have some fun in. Thanks to voice chat support in most multiplayer games, they are now a means of communication and hanging out with friends, especially in MMO games where virtual hangout exists!
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The social features in multiplayer games sometimes move one step forward and become a hub to find new friends. It's happened to a lot of gamers that they have a come across a nice person in an online game, and they have stuck together for a long time.

  is quite an unforgiving shooter experience, as a single bullet in the right spot will guarantee a kill. It requires a lot of focus and dedication to collect the right equipment and put them to good use. So, it's safe to say that the game has a really long learning curve.
 </p>
 <p>
  The players, however, can randomly join other players if they want to, and this is a big opportunity to find some great friends who have each other's backs in challenging situations. Even without joining someone in matchmaking, the proximity voice chat will allow the player to talk to strangers on the map, and who knows, maybe a good soul is there!

  Since

 </p>
 <p>
  The sheer amount of creativity in this game is evident in the many servers that exist for players to check out. It's easy to find other players to spend some time with. The carefree nature of the game makes it easy to have fun with other players, although older players should know that the majority of players in this game are pretty young.

  <em>
   Hell Let Loose
  </em>
  is a large-scale tactical shooter where communication is key to success. And where there is communication, there can be friendships too. Each player is assigned to a squad, where they should contact the squad leader and receive orders from them. The squad leaders themselves, though, receive orders from the commander, who is usually an overly experienced player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most
  <em>
   Hell Let Loose
  </em>
  servers kick players for not communicating or not having a microphone. So, the player has to actively report about their position and the situation they are facing, and this creates some magnificent friendships within squads, which encourages them to play again and again.

  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  is one of the most fun and beautiful massively multiplayer adventure games in which players can become legendary pirates and explore adventures and a treasures-filled open world. Players can not only create their characters and join narrative-driven campaigns but can experience their favorite pirate stories in a whole new way while going on an epic adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gamers will have to explore, sail powerful pirate ships, show off their swordplay skills, loot, find treasures, and conquer territories to become one of the greatest pirate legends who ever set sail. It's a more complex game, so beginners might want to check out useful guides on how to make money and other tips or try to go on adventures as a single player before joining one of the groups online and making new friends.

  The world of
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  is quite unforgiving and what that dictates to players is not to trust each other. Every
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  player has at least tasted a betrayal once after trusting someone in-game and befriending them. However, there are indeed good experiences where players have trusted and helped each other in difficult circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything in
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  is in extreme condition. Players might decide to be friendly because they need resources. Still, when the relationship begins, the bonds between survivors get stronger, especially when they see how their friends support them in risky situations. So,
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  is indeed a great place to find real friends, though it might be a bit tough.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Snap
   </strong>
  </em>
  's latest season adds more of the Young Avengers to the game. With more cards, locations, and characters being added to
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  , the developers continue to try to make timely additions. Coming from the success of the recent Maximum Effort season with Deadpool being the main focus, the Young Avengers are next in line.

 <p>
  Several members of the Young Avengers have already made their debut in the game. Patriot decks were previously some of the most overpowered stacks available. America Chavez has had her ability nerfed a bit because some fans deemed it too powerful. Iron Lad
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  decks are a good choice for those looking for unpredictability. However, even with this selection of cards, there's a lot more from the Young Avengers IP that
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  could introduce soon, and it looks like that time is now.

 <p>
  The latest season introduces more Young Avengers to
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  . According to the
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  website, Season Pass character Kate Bishop adds two random arrow cards from a selection of four to players' hands. The first week's featured character is Marvel Boy, who gives three 1-cost cards +1 Power after every turn. This might be very handy for those Patriot decks in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  that rely on 1-cost cards. Wiccan and Speed, Scarlet Witch and Vision's children, also make their in-game debut. Wiccan adds a +2 Max Energy if all Energy is spent before the turn the card is played, while Speed gains +1 Power for each turn where all Energy is used up. Lastly, Emperor Hulking copies the text of a random 6-cost card.

 <p>
  In addition, two new locations will also be added to the game in the form of the Destroyed Mansion and the Clubhouse. The Destroyed Mansion might be something that Darkhawk users will enjoy, as it adds one rock to the location and one Vibranium to a player's hand. Although several
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  players have found Darkhawk counters. The Clubhouse offers +1 Power to cards at other locations once it is filled. Again, this might be something that fits well with the Patriot and Marvel Boy cards.

 <p>
  Several new
  <em>

  </em>
  albums will also be introduced. The Flaviano album rewards a Galactus OK Emote upon completion. A Miss America album also grants players with several America Chavez-themed rewards at several intervals. Plus, a new Jubilee variant, avatar, and emote will also be available soon. It looks to be an interesting month for Young Avengers fans as
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  's new additions will make things interesting.

 <p>
  Consumables are found literally all over the place in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deathbound
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Unlike a lot of other Soulslike games, this one really wants you to use Consumables as you find them. However, not all Consumables are equal in this game, and a lot of them are a lot more sparse than you might think.
 </p>

 <p>
  Unfortunately, at least in our experience with the game, there aren't any NPC vendors in
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  , meaning you're not able to stockpile certain Consumables nearly as much as Soulslikes which do have vendors. Thankfully, some enemies drop certain items and some areas seem to refresh the Consumable lootable items on the ground, so stockpiling is still possible (at least to an extent). With all this new information in mind, why don't we take a look at all the Consumables in
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  overall, and talk about some of the best ones?

  Listed above are all the Consumables we could find throughout our
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  playthrough, and as you can see there are quite a lot of them. For the most part, these
  <strong>
   Consumables can be broken down into three overarching categories: Healing Items, Buffing Items, &amp; Throwables.
  </strong>
  Healing Items in this game are actually pretty rare, and there are really only three items in the game overall that'll directly heal any of your Essences.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Buffing Items are the most common, with each one typically getting rid of some Status Ailment and then raising your Tolerance to said Ailment for the next minute or so. And finally, there are Throwable Items, which are comparable to the Firebombs in the Dark Souls games AKA items you'll throw at the target you're locked onto that can deal direct damage and often inflict Status Ailments as well.

       Honestly shouldn't even count as a 'Consumable' as this is the equivalent of your Estus Flask in Deathbound. You gain 4 of these on each 'life' with them auto replenishing any time you die and respawn or interact with the Phylactery. Just remember, this heals your active Essence while siphoning health from your inactive ones, so it's not as simple as just using it for a flat heal.

       This is one of the main ways Deathbound takes a concept that other Soulslikes use, and switches it up a bit. In other Soulslikes or even Dark Souls itself, there are often items that are basically condensed versions of whatever the 'currency' is in the game, allowing you to use them to get that last little bit of currency to gain another level up. In Deathbound, however, Crystallised Essences also heal your active Essence for a flat amount when used, and even the Small Crystallised Essences heal for about as much as your Essence Enhancer. Of course, you're also running the risk of losing the very same Experience you just popped this item to gain, so it's a bit of a high-risk high-reward option.

       Next up is what we determined to be the best Throwable item in Deathbound, the Freezing Liquid Flask. These are found relatively often in the first few areas of the game, but they become a lot more rare the further you explore (and Fast Travel is sadly not unlocked until the last 10-20 percent of the game). When used, it'll Freeze whatever enemy you hit with it (most enemies are frozen with one Flask), allowing you to readjust, heal up, and then even position yourself behind the enemy with Anna to backstab them, if they're human-sized that is.

       This includes the Jar of Strength, Eye Drops, and Blue Grass, with the recommended item of choice being the one that matches the damage type you deal the most. If you're using Tehkri the most, you'll want to use Blue Grass, if you rely on Anna's Crossbow a lot, use the Eye Drops, and then of course use the Jar of Strength for any Melee Damage builds. These items are relatively common and are a massive damage buff that last for a whole minute each use.

       Anaesthetic is our last Consumable recommendation on here, and it's pretty deceptive at first as to the actual 'use' of this item. Your mileage may vary, but for us, the combat of Deathbound felt pretty awkward and restrictive a lot of the time, which made just swinging until the enemy goes down a better choice (a lot of the time) then actually worrying about Morph Dodges, Perfect Blocks, and so on. And, in those scenarios where you just want to have a DPS race with the boss of choice, Anaesthetic is great, as it makes it a lot harder for the enemy to knock you out of your attack animation.

  And those are, what we feel to be, the best Consumables in
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  . You may notice that none of the items that raise your Tolerance are on here as well as the Ancient Seeds, and that's simply due to the fact that Status Ailments don't matter against a lot of the bosses in
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  , and even if you are inflicted with Burning or Corruption, you can usually easily outpace the damage it deals with the innate lifesteal you gain on your inactive Essences by dealing damage.

 <p>
  If you're really struggling with a boss that deals a lot of Buildup, they're obviously worth using, but they are far from the 'best' Consumables you can find in the game. For the Ancient Seeds as well as all the other Consumables not mentioned in the table above, it really just boils down to them being difficult to find. Again,
  <em>
   Deathbound
  </em>
  has a Fast Travel system, but you don't unlock it until really the final stretch of the game, so if you wanted to go back to a previous area to see if the environmental Consumables had respawned, you have to tediously make the trek all the way back, which no one is really going to do.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have gathered online to show off their "almost perfect" Shiny Pokemon, which were just a few points shy of being a "Hundo" Pokemon. Hundo Shiny Pokemon are very rare in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  due to extremely low encounter rates, but limited-time events like Community Day can boost the chance of encountering such a Pokemon in the wild.

 <p>
  Shiny hunting is a recurring activity for the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  community, nearly eight years after the game's launch. Thanks to the game's long-term support from developer Niantic,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  continues to receive new limited-time events and Pokemon, ensuring that players have plenty of chances to encounter and catch Shiny Pokemon in the wild. If lucky, players may also encounter a Shiny Hundo Pokemon with max attack, defense, and HP stats. These elusive Pokemon are highly sought after by the community, as most players are more than likely to encounter Shiny Pokemon with imperfect stats if the opportunity to catch a Shiny presents itself.

 <p>
  Reddit user Austinmg11 shared a screenshot of their "almost perfect" Shiny Giratina from
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , and other players in the community are chiming in with their similarly imperfect Shiny Pokemon. Austinmg11's Shiny Giratina has perfect attack and HP stats, but its defense stats are just a few points away from being the max possible value. Fellow Pokemon players Longjumping-Fox5521 and Deviant-420 shared their Shiny Celebi, which both have imperfect stats that exclude them from ever reaching Hundo status. It appears that other players in the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  community, including Reddit user ajf48, have encountered and caught an imperfect Shiny Celebi as well.

  Although these Shiny Pokemon do not have perfect stats, they're still useful in raid battles and other activities in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . In addition, select Pokemon such as Shiny Charizard and Shiny Venusaur may benefit from Mega evolutions, allowing them to become much stronger than their counterparts. Moreover, those players who recently obtained a non-Hundo Lunala and Solgaleo in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  may still fuse those Pokemon with a Hundo Necrozma to receive an equally powerful Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma.

  Players will have an opportunity to hunt for more Shiny Hundo Pokemon when the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Community Day events for August arrive. Firstly, the Community Day Classic event featuring Beldum will begin on August 18. The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Community Day event featuring Popplio will begin a few weeks later, on August 31. Both of these new events will have boosted encounter rates, which also increase the chances of encountering a Shiny Pokemon in the wild.

   <em>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  has stolen the spotlight. Its release has driven the
  <em>
   COD
  </em>
  Community back to its roots. The game brings back memorable maps and a nostalgic UI which reignite the spirits of the OG fans.
  <em>

  The variety of different weapons in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is what makes it such a good game to play. Since the debut of
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  , players have been trying to find the right weapons to use. Having the most overpowered weapon in the lobby is a goal many players wish to accomplish. While some players are fans of the ARs, others love the SMGs, but there are also players that are absolutely crazy about marksman rifles. This guide helps players select the best weapon with the help of this Top 10 list.

    Updated on August 6, 2024, by Mehrdad Khayyat:
   </strong>
   Marksman Rifles might never reach the popularity of assault rifles or SMGs in Call of Duty unless they rule the meta. Surprisingly, that was the case with Kar98k when it was added to the game back in Season 4.

 <p>
  Although the weapon is now nerfed, Kar98k is still quite powerful in long-range battles as it has the highest effective range among the best marksman rifles that a player can choose from. With that massive meta shake-up, it is worth going over the ranking and making some changes.

 <p>
  The Lockwood MK2 is a high-power and lever-action rifle that is suitable for mid-range gunfights. It has great mobility and amazing accuracy. The recoil of the gun is pretty balanced and has good handling. It is a fun weapon to use with great stats to back it up.

 <p>
  Lockwood MK2 has the shortest effective range among all the weapons on this list, which makes it pretty weak against targets that are more than 7 meters away from the player. While having the highest Headshot Damage, the weapon is only suitable for close quarters and game modes where enemies are not too far away.

  EBR 14 is a returning weapon from the previous
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  . It uses 7.62x51mm NATO rounds, making it a powerful gun to use. The EBR inflicts great damage and has a fast firing rate. It also has a great range, making it a worthy weapon to use in long-distance fights.

 <p>
  Despite all these stellar statistics, EBR 14 is quite a heavy weapon, making the player character move slower than usual. This could be a massive downside in small maps where players have to move a lot to avoid getting shot at and to surprise their opponents.

 <p>
  The TAQ-M is an amazing Marksman Rifle, it just doesn't rank higher than other options players have. It uses the 8.5mm Sniper round, making it easily one of the best rifles to use at long ranges. It offers great accuracy while providing great handling.

 <p>
  Overall, TAQ-M is quite balanced in most of its statistics. It offers a decent perfect range for a marksman rifle while keeping both upper body and headshot damages high enough to remain effective. The ADS Time is also short, which is another plus for this weapon.

  In the bottom three, players can expect the Tempus Torrent, a highly versatile and hard-hitting gun. While using the 7.62 rounds, the gun offers a decent damage range and great accuracy.

 <p>
  It has increased mobility and enhanced handling. Match this gun with the right attachments, and the result will be one of the most lethal Marksman Rifles in the game. However, similar to Lockwood MK2, Tempus Torrent is also a heavy gun, which makes the player character move at a slower pace than the other enemies.

 <p>
  The SA-B 50 isn't a bad weapon by any means, especially since it's a swift and impactful Bolt-action Rifle. This rifle excels in providing significant long-range support. Supported by sniper ammunition, the SA-B 50 boasts exceptional damage capabilities, making it a formidable choice.

 <p>
  Looking at the damage units, SA-B 50 is a tempting option on this list, especially knowing that it is lightweight enough to let players move at a significantly higher speed. Effective range is the only part that SA-B 50 falls short, but for close-quarter game modes, this should not be a big deal.

 <p>
  The KVD Enforcer, an
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  weapon, uses 7.62 ammo rounds, making it highly capable of destruction with a huge damage range and accuracy. The right attachments would make this gun unstoppable.

 <p>
  The weapon is quite capable in long-range gunfights, and thanks to its considerably brief ADS time, players will have a better chance of shooting the first shot at the opponent with this weapon, especially in maps and game modes where constant movement is inevitable and players cannot stay stationary and hold angles for a long time.

  The MCW 6.8 secures a spot in the top 4, being hailed as the new DMR of Warzone. Renowned for its sheer lethality, this firearm stands as a powerhouse during combat. Its marksman attributes include exceptional accuracy and an impressive damage range.

 <p>
  Looking at the statics, MCW 6.8 should have been placed behind KVD Enforcer, but that could only happen by ignoring the recoil. MCW 6.8 comes with an easily controllable horizontal recoil, which makes it a better gun for steady fires. It also has a much higher bullet velocity.

 <p>
  Number 3 on the list is the MTZ Interceptor. It is rated so highly due to its ability to shut down any enemy attack within seconds. This rifle uses the trusty 7.62 ammo rounds, making it great for long-range gunfights. The MTZ has great accuracy, which mixed with its recoil control makes it a must-have weapon.

 <p>
  Sacrificing some range to gain more damage on the upper body and headshot shouldn't be a bad idea, especially if the weapon still remains strong in mid-range fights. That is the exact quality expected from the MTZ Interceptor, which comes with a higher ADS time but a lighter weight compared to MCW 6.8.

  The number 2 undisputed marksman rifle is the DM56. It uses the 5.56 NATO rounds, making it a terrific force. The gun has an excellent fire rate along with the ability to smash everything in its path. The mobility of the weapon allows players to move around easily during fights. It is the King of this category and is unchallenged.

 <p>
  Although DM56 has the lowest damage rate among all weapons listed here, it comes with 20 rounds per magazine, which is almost as high as an assault rifle. Reloading in fast-paced gunfights is one of the major nightmares for every player, and DM56 will help a lot with that.

  Kar98k is the only weapon here that is capable of keeping its effective shots in ranges above 50 meters. When the weapon was first deployed into Modern Warfare 3, it was an absolute beast, until Sledgehammer Games nerfed its damage rate as well as bullet velocity.

 <p>
  Despite all the nerfs applied, Kar98k is still the best marksman rifle in Modern Warfare 3 for sharpshooters. For players who don't miss their shots easily, Kar98k is an absolute killing machine to work with, especially in Warzone and game modes with larger maps.

  It's no secret that celebrities all over the world enjoy video games. While not everyone has time to play games as much as they'd like, even the most decorated Olympic medalist of all time plays
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  . However, this may be the first known instance of an Olympic winner enjoying the ink shooter

  It recently came to light that Yared Nuguse really enjoys

  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  , and has featured an image of himself wearing a
  <em>
   Splatoon 3

  jacket based on Grizzco and the Salmon Run game mode.

  Splatoon 3 Player Brings Home the Medal for Team USA
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  players have special reason to celebrate, then, as the middle-distance runner for Team USA just brought home the Bronze medal in the Olympic 1500 Meter race. It was an incredibly close race, with Nuguse coming in third at 3:27.79, with the Silver medalist passing him by just one one-hundredth of a second. His fellow Team USA compatriot won Gold at 3:27.65, meaning the three racers were only separated by a quarter of a second at most. While there may be other Olympians who like
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  , it doesn't seem any of them have been outspoken about it like Nuguse.

  Many
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  fans seem delighted by the fact that someone who's so proud of being a fan of the series is now also an Olympic medalist. While Nuguse's races in the 2024 Olympics are over, the racer has also previously won Silver in the 3000 m World Indoor Championships in 2023. His record for indoor mile running also places him as the second-fastest indoor mile runner of all time.

  Somehow, Nuguse manages to find time to train to this level of expertise while playing
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  on the side. Perhaps the portable nature of the Nintendo Switch makes this easier for the athlete. In any case, as gaming becomes even more widespread and accessible, chances are many more Olympic athletes will list video games as one of their favorite hobbies in the future when they're not practicing their sport.

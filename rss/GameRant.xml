  The Iron Rivet Set is a reward for defeating Red Bear inside the Northern Nameless Mausoleum in Rauh Ruins. Reaching the Northern Mausoleum requires unsealing the sealed spiritspring near the Rauh Ruins Map Fragment. The stacked sealing stones can be found just a little ways away.

  Ancient Ruins of Rauh can be reached by entering the small cave entrance directly north of the Moorth Ruins, on the northern edge of the pond, with ghostly fingers (marked in the screenshot above). Follow the path west, and itâ€™ll take you to the
  <strong>
   Ancient Ruins Base
  </strong>
  . Follow the road southwest, avoiding the stone golems, and youâ€™ll find the Rauh Ruins Map Fragment Stele to the right; the sealed spiritspring should be right behind you. Head up the hill, hugging the wall next to the spiritspring, and youâ€™ll reach the stacked sealing stones behind a broken-down wall. Destroy them to unseal the spring and jump up with Torrent to reach the
  <strong>
   Red Bear boss fight
  </strong>
  . Defeat the Red Bear to obtain the Iron Rivet Set and the Red Bear Claw.

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Gives The Elder Scrolls 6 an Interesting Dilemma to Consider</title>

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's reveal trailer dropped several weeks ago, and many fans of the series were surprised by the art style that was represented in the trailer. While
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  has never been a realistic series, and the art style in
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  has never remained consistent between games, the simplified, 3D cartoonlike style of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  trailer was a step in a very unexpected direction for many fans. The release of the gameplay trailer shortly after showcased a less cartoony art style, but it is still clear that the art of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is in a different direction to that of its predecessors.

  It's been a while since Bethesda has released any substantive news about
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  's development, including its possible art style.
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series differs from
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  in that its art style remains relatively consistent from installment to installment, with only the improvements in game development technology and narrative design marking any real changes. While there are many good reasons to change
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  's art style, there's also a clear case to keep the art style the same.

 <p>
  Setting has proven to be one of the most important factors in the art style in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  , as it defines the architecture, landscape, and design of even organic beings such as people and animals. For example, the horses in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  , found in a very temperate Cyrodiil, are far more graceful and leaner than the stout and hardy horses found in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . With
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  's rumored move to Hammerfell would come the opportunity to lean into another different art style, and hopefully one that is more visually striking than
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  's.

 <p>
  It has also been 13 years since
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's release. Game development technology has taken massive steps forward, and it may be time to give
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  a revamp. While the art style in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  is fine, it's not unique or distinctive in any way, and refining the art style could go a long way in defining the series, especially after such a long gap between
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Alternatively, Bethesda could choose to leave
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  's art style unchanged. Consistency across a series is desirable to retain its identity and, while this is less common in video games than it is in TV shows and movies, consistency is important for brand awareness and genre for audiences. As seen with the reception of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's reveal trailer, pivoting the art style too much can result in backlash from some fans, who may feel as if the spirit of the games is lost.

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  already has interesting art to draw from thanks to the many cultures present in Tamriel. Dunmer, Nord, and Redguard art all have visually striking and distinct styles that would be difficult to translate exactly to a 3D video game, but could absolutely influence a unique art style that still remains true to
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  . If
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is set in Hammerfell, the location and culture of the Redguards could prove to be the perfect opportunity to create a more stylized art style that makes
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  immediately identifiable.

  Fans were quick to notice that a new item recently added to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  closely resembles a piece of jewelry seen in the reveal trailer from
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  . This new item is found within
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  and acts as a tease for Rockstar's highly anticipated next entry in the world-renowned franchise.

  Over a decade later, Rockstar's
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  continues to be a monolith in the gaming world. Praised for its rich open world, robust gameplay features, and insane storylines,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is still very much a tentpole moment in video game history, with the game's online component,
  <em>
   GTA Online,
  </em>
  still seeing millions of players daily. Recent reports show engagement in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is actually growing, likely due to the excitement surrounding Rockstar's next entry in the franchise. Officially unveiled late last year, Rockstar finally gave fans a brief look at
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , complete with new characters, settings, and, most notably, substantial graphical improvements. With still over a year until its expected release, fans are eagerly anticipating getting their hands on
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , with one player noticing an aspect of the game has already made its way into
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  .

  Reddit user DogWifDreads noticed the striking resemblance a certain necklace in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  had to the one seen during the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  trailer. "I was rewatching a trailer breakdown, and I noticed that the necklaces seen here in the trailer have been added in go with the Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC," said the user. There's certainly no denying the similarities between the two pieces of jewelry, with the new
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  necklace practically being a carbon copy of the one seen in the trailer.

  While

  </strong>
  is still very much alive, the brief glimpse Rockstar shared of

  last year set the internet on fire, with the video receiving nearly 200 million views on YouTube. The next chapter in the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto

  series takes players to Vice City, Rockstar's take on Miami, Florida, meaning players will likely have access to a wider range of vehicles, including planes, boats, and, of course, exotic cars. An official release date for

  is yet to be announced, but rumors indicate Rockstar is planning for a Fall 2025 release.

  Obsidian Entertainment is bringing its experience with classic RPGs into a world of first-person combat with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Avowed
   </strong>
  </em>
  later this year, and this title is set to feature a streamlined approach to player progression that fits the shift. The studio has a history with titles that have utilized both traditional class-based systems and those revolving around skills alone alike, and it appears that both of these styles have gone on to inform its latest effort. It might be true that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is set within the same universe as
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  , but its lack of classes indicates that it actually takes more influence from the streamlined designs of action games.

  While
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has faced
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  comparisons since its initial reveal, its similarities to an experience like
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  have become more apparent with each of its recent showcases. Instead of adhering to the explicitly defined classes found in RPGs like the
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  titles,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's progression is made up of skill trees that represent different playstyles. This seems to encourage players to create versatile builds that favor multiclassing over the typical archetypes of the genre.

  The three primary skill trees that make up the bulk of

Points can be assigned across these trees freely due to the lack of classes, and they can also be reallocated at will to adjust around specific scenarios. Various types of spells are all within this single spellcasting tree, and the presence of complementary sources of additional magic skills further highlights

A companion-focused tree suggests skills centered around party interactions and tactics, but specifics remain unknown in gameplay shown so far. Given that these demigod-like beings are associated with the gods of Eora, there may even be an inherent ability to access magic across all builds.

  Leaving the Class System of Pillars of Eternity Behind
 </h3>
 <p>
  There was a robust set of classes and their intersecting subclasses in the second
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  title, but the layers provided by these distinctions have been broken down in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . Magic could be split between spells types like Faith, Arcane, and Nature which caster classes had access to, but these will now all presumably be available under the umbrella of the general Wizard tree. Now that many of the previously available talents and abilities of
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  are likely to be consolidated into a lower number within
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's skill trees, there might be an inevitable overlap that technically gives the player traits of a multiclass no matter what route is taken.

 <h3 id="the-versatility-of-grimoires">
  The Versatility of Grimoires
 </h3>
 <p>
  On top of whatever offerings will be present within Wizard skills, there are also confirmed to be spells that are exclusive to Grimoires in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  that can be found in the world and equipped for casting. This not only expands the possibilities for investing in purely non-magical skill trees while still having access to these spells, but also building unique takes on casters that also utilize what the Wizard has by default. Between the constant ability of the player to remake their entire build and this kind of freedom in accessing choices within combat,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is shaping up to be an engaging platform for experimenting with styles beyond the conventional bounds of RPG classes.

 <p>
  While leagues of players have tried the free title,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  isn't getting entirely favorable reviews. On its Steam page, the co-op game currently has a "Mixed" rating based on 5,349 user reviews. Out of these, only 2,269 reviews are marked as positive, with some players liking the game overall despite facing some technical issues. On the flip side, negative reviewers criticized the game for being too similar to popular online looter shooters like
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  , as well as for its perceived "pay-to-win" elements. A few user reviews suggested that, while
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  's gameplay doesn't seem to be an issue, its story may need some more work.

  As soon as the game launched, some players revealed that they had not received their in-game purchases despite completing their payment. Developer Nexon has acted quickly to remedy the issue, while also issuing compensation for
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  players as an apology. Given the prompt way in which the devs are responding to player feedback, many players are eager to see how
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  performs over the next few weeks and if the game can sustain or grow its initial popularity.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a beloved indie farming RPG that simulates a peaceful life in the idyllic Pelican Town. After taking over their grandfather's farm, players can grow, charm and quest their way through the game to unlock achievements, secrets and to have an all around wonderful life. Since its release in 2016, the game has gained a passionate and loyal fanbase which has supported developer ConcernedApe at every turn.

 <p>
  To further show their affection for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , many fans of the game have created extensive, well-developed mods that allow players to explore the game even further. Mods are typically downloadable content that allows fans to adjust games to include certain aspects that the original game does not have, such as new farming equipment or easy teleportation. Some mods are built exclusively to facilitate the mechanics of the game, while others introduce entirely new areas or NPCs to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>
  There's a multitude of unique mods that show immense dedication and care, including some that broaden the dating pool for players that are looking for love.

   One of Stardew Valley's biggest strengths is the seamless way it integrates the lives of dozens of NPCs into the game's overarching storyline, making the player feel for these bits of code, and sometimes, even fall in love. After hundreds of hours and multiple playthroughs, however, the lives and wants of these NPCs can seem a bit figured out, diminishing the spark that was there before. To remedy this and keep the game fresh, mod authors have seen fit to add their own marriage candidates to the pool of potential
  </em>
  <em>
   bachelors and bachelorettes of Pelican Town
  </em>
  <em>
   as a way to give players that feeling of discovering a new love all over again. The best of these are mods that introduce complex, multi-dimensional characters who feel as if they were a part of this wonderful whimsical world all along.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Polyamory Sweet mod
  </strong>
  is a little unlike the others that add additional or new marriage candidates. Instead, this mod introduces the concepts of polyamory and consensual non-monogamy to Pelican Town and allows players to have multiple partners at a time. So, while it doesn't exactly
  <em>
   add
  </em>
  partners, it opens up the dating pool substantially.

 <p>
  For functional reasons, the player will likely have one main spouse (which can be changed freely), but other than that, they can have multiple partners and spouses, which will bring unique rooms to the house. It also allows the player's other spouses to attend new weddings, other NPCs to kiss, and lets multiple characters sleep in one bed. This mod is all about free love, and gives players the chance to get to know all the people in Pelican Town on another level. It even adds a new NPC (non-romanceable) to oversee the custom items that help players manage their life, and the mod is regularly updated by its creator.

  There are plenty of custom NPCs in the world of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  mods, and gamers all over the world work hard to tailor the game in a personal way.
  <strong>
   Shiko
  </strong>
  is a great example of the kinds of NPCs that fans are making, and is a great way to see how much they can add to the
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  experience.

 <p>
  Shiko is a cool ex-model who moves to Pelican Town for a little peace after her life of stardom. This effortlessly-stylish icon comes with her own set of heart events and is completely romanceable, meaning players can marry her and have her move out of the Stardrop Saloon and into the farmer's house. Any player who wants a mysterious and glamorous partner will absolutely love this mod.

  <strong>
   Isla
  </strong>
  is another custom NPC mod, adding a mysterious new character who's a little harder to pin down than the usual Pelican Town singles. Isla is an aqua-haired NPC with a mystical nature whom the player can meet if they venture to the beach at the right time. Getting to know her will reveal brilliant secrets, and slowly, the player can grow a beautiful relationship with her.

 <p>
  Isla is a very cool and unique custom NPC unlike any other denizen of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , which gives players a really fresh romantic experience. She prefers sea-based gifts and comes complete with all the heart events, as well as her own spousal room if players decide to marry her. She even has different seasonal outfits, just like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley's
  </em>
  1.6 update, and attends Pelican Town's various events - with her own dialogue and location.

  This mod does add a "new" marriage candidate, but not quite in the way players may think.
  <strong>
   Romanceable Rasmodius
  </strong>
  specifically makes Rasmodius a marriage candidate and brings 6 unique heart events as players grow their relationship with him. It also adds dozens of new dialogue lines for Rasmodius and adjusts his behaviour post-marriage. The mod works alongside
  <em>
   Stardew Valley Expanded
  </em>
  , and will need that installed to work properly.

  <strong>
   Romanceable Rasmodia
  </strong>
  works with
  <em>
   Stardew Valley Expanded
  </em>
  or Romaceable Rasmodius to make a female iteration of Rasmodius that is romanceable. It literally turns Rasmodius into Rasmodia, and will adjust the game to fit Rasmodia's character without changing too much else. It's a perfect option for players who don't really want to switch up their game, but would like to see a cool Witch in the forest tower instead of a Wizard.

  This mod adds a blonde named
  <strong>
   Aspen
  </strong>
  to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  in an immersive way. With the mod is implemented, Aspen seems a part of Pelican Town just as much as anybody else, with a detailed backstory and understandable reasons for being there. Due to the blockage caused by the Joja facility, she finds herself stuck in Pelican Town and can't return to her own farm, which is a little ways away. As a result, she slowly integrates into the daily goings-on in this quaint corner of the world, makes friends of her own, and is fully a part of the town by the time the player meets her.

 <p>
  Aspen is fully romanceable with hundreds of lines of dialogue, heart events up to year 3, and a lot more. The mod is still in development, and the mod author plans to add more content in new updates, but it is fully playable in its current state.

  This brilliant
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  mod adds three wonderful new NPCs, and one of them -
  <strong>
   Sterling
  </strong>
  - is available for players to fall in love with. It's a mod that specifically builds on the East Scarp mod, so players should be sure to download that one first. All three new characters, Henry, Mia, and Sterling Cooper, have unique dialogue and outfits that change based on the event and location.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":912} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The main draw of this mod is the new storyline it adds to the East Scarp area, but Sterling is a great new addition to the marriage pool. Although he's a little bit lost, his genuine nature makes him a very endearing and a brilliant new choice for players - particularly since he's unlike any other marriage candidate so far. The mod also adds new recipes for any players who enjoy cooking. It's worth noting that the mod does not change the weather, and the title is more for dramatic impact.

  The
  <strong>
   Adventurer's Guild Expanded mod
  </strong>
  elaborates on the monster aspects of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and adds completely new lore on where they come from, as well as additional information about the mines. Players can even become friends with a little monster companion who will come to live in their house.

 <p>
  Most importantly, this mod adds two additional NPCs - Marlon's children - who move to Pelican Town to start a monster research wing of the Adventurer's Guild.
  <strong>
   Gabriel and Zinnia
  </strong>
  move to the Stardew Valley as young adults, and each of them have 6 unique events at different stages of their relationship with the player. This mod adds a whole new dimension to the mines/monster sections of the game, and both new NPCs bring something fresh to the dating pool while also giving the player a little more insight into Marlon's backstory.

  In this mod,
  <strong>
   Juliet and Jessie
  </strong>
  are two additions to Pelican Town with drastically different demeanors and mannerisms. Where Julie is brash, flirty, and wears her emotions on her sleeve, Jessie is a motherly, understanding, and always ready to lend a helping hand. Both are clerks at JojaMart due to different reasons, but they couldn't be more different. Both live in a manor behind the community center and are seamlessly integrated into the lives of the residents, offering comments about other NPCs in certain situations.

 <p>
  Both Juliet and Jessie are romanceable, though Juliet only becomes available as a potential love interest after the community center is fully completed. The mod is feature-complete in its current state, but more add-ons are planned for the future as well.

  This charming mod focuses on the story of
  <strong>
   Lunna
  </strong>
  , a mysterious woman who is not quite what she seems. Lunna will be under the care of Rasmodius, the reclusive wizard found in Cindersnap Forest.
  <strong>
   Lunna: Astray in Stardew Valley
  </strong>
  adds three brand new dateable NPCs: Lunna, Bianka and Raphael.

 <p>
  Players will have to play through Lunna's story in order to meet Bianka and Raphael, but once they do, all three characters are romance options and players can marry any one of them. There are also exclusive recipes that can be unlocked for any
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  cooking enthusiasts. This mod adds an extra spark of magic and exploration, allowing players to visit Lunna's home, Umuwi, if they're persistent enough with her story.

  <strong>
   Downtown Zuzu
  </strong>
  is a cool, expansive mod that adds an entirely new area to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>
  Downtown Zuzu is more urban than Pelican Town, and offers a huge amount of new places to explore and characters to meet. Some of the best places in this mod include a busy mall, a lovely high street and an airport.

 <p>
  Regarding romance, Downtown Zuzu adds 6 brand-new dateable NPCs. Each of them are unique and interesting in their own right, ranging from shy goth-girl
  <strong>
   Gwen
  </strong>
  to uppity Joja CEO
  <strong>
   Kristoff
  </strong>
  . This mod adds an entirely new dimension to the game and the dateable characters are very much integrated into the complex new areas of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley.
  </em>

  Longtime fans of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  will likely be familiar with the
  <strong>
   Stardew Valley Expanded mod
  </strong>
  . It is a massive mod that adds absolutely everything to the game, expanding on the world, NPCs and even the types of fish players can catch. The amount of care and dedication put into this mod cannot be overstated.

 <p>
  Along with the incredible amount of content players get from it, Stardew Valley Expanded also adds 6 new dateable characters. The familiar face of the Wizard is among these, which will delight any players who have been keen to romance
  <strong>
   Rasmodius
  </strong>
  . However, there are 5 other brand-new characters with carefully created backstories and dialogue, such as daring adventurer
  <strong>
   Lance
  </strong>
  or classy mother
  <strong>
   Olivia
  </strong>
  <strong>
   .

  <strong>
   Looking for Love
  </strong>
  is a great mod that allows players to romance some of the other single, but previously unavailable NPCs. Some
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players, particularly older ones, can be disappointed that most of the bachelor/bachelorette NPCs are young adults. There are many players who wish to romance some of the more mature and endearing singles in Pelican Town.

 <p>
  This mod will allow players to date the likes of
  <strong>
   Gus, Clint, Marnie
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Pam
  </strong>
  . In total, it adds 9 of the unmarried, classic
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  NPCs to the dating pool which offers players new dialogue, events and spouse rooms. It is worth noting that this mod specifically builds on another mod named Siv's Marriage Mod which, unfortunately, has not been updated since 2017. Looking For Love offers updated files and relevant fixes, and is more reliable for players who are looking to dive into this new pool of dateable characters.

  Alongside
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  Expanded and Downtown Zuzu, the
  <strong>
   East Scarp mod
  </strong>
  adds an entirely new area of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  for players to explore. It includes new homes, shops and secrets to uncover, as well as a group of 10 new dateable NPCs. This allows players to experience new romance events, areas and a brand-new bird-watching aspect.

  These dateable NPC's cover a broad spectrum, including
  <strong>
   Sen
  </strong>
  , a mine-dwelling shadow, and
  <strong>
   Aideen
  </strong>
  a well-spoken, Victorian-era enthusiast. These new marriage candidates also tie in with familiar
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  faces, such as
  <strong>
   Tristan
  </strong>
  , a rebellious but charming adventurer, who is (non-canonically) Jas' father.

  <strong>
   Ridgeside Village
  </strong>
  is another enormous mod for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley,
  </em>
  adding an entirely new village along with an incredible slew of over 50 NPCs. Longtime fans of the game will be satisfied for months while playing through all the new content, including a vast field of dateable characters. This also makes it perfect for replays, allowing gamers to choose different partners and options each time.

  Ridgeside Village offers 22 new marriage candidates, some of them obvious bachelors and bachelorettes, and others more difficult to romance. Among the bachelors are
  <strong>
   June
  </strong>
  , a gentle pianist, and
  <strong>
   Ian
  </strong>
  , a kindhearted and reliable laborer. A few of the bachelorettes include
  <strong>
   Alissa
  </strong>
  , another farmer with a flair for the arts, and the awkwardly adorable
  <strong>
   Flor
  </strong>
  . For players after the trickier dateable NPCs, there are a few secrets to winning their hearts. For example,
  <strong>
   Irene
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Anton
  </strong>
  can be marriage candidates, but players will have to dedicate time to reaching their 8 heart events in order to pursue them. Others, like
  <strong>
   Daia
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Jio
  </strong>
  , are unlocked after certain events and stories are completed.

  Players will be getting a lot of loot while going through dungeons and fighting enemies in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </strong>
  </em>
  . With each character being able to use any weapon, there are many different builds that can be tried out, with gear pieces acting as additional bonuses for whatever build you're going for.

  Lots of gear can be equipped right when it is found, while others will be unrecognizable and require the players to appraise them. Other pieces of gear will be fairly strong, but can also be purified to make them even stronger; here's how to do both.

      Blessed Water is a key item necessary for purifying gear in Metaphor: ReFantazio. This article has been updated to include the two major methods in obtaining more of them, as they are not a naturally farmable item that players will find a ton of unless you are already going out of you way in every dungeon you explore.

  Unrecognizable gear won't be in your equipment menu, and instead be in your main inventory with a question mark in the icon for whatever type of item it is. To appraise the item and make it usable,
  <strong>
   head to either a general store, armor store, or blacksmith
  </strong>
  . Any store can appraise any unrecognizable item, and the resulting options and cost will be the same.

 <p>
  Appraisal will be the third option when interacting with the shop owner of each option, with a fee appearing along the right side of the screen. Before appraising anything, it is best to save before doing so, as appraisal can lead to a few results. Each unrecognizable item
  <strong>
   can be appraised into multiple possible items
  </strong>
  , all being at about the same level stat-wise. The quality of the unrecognizable is determined where it is found, so it's best to get anything appraised right away.

  Rare weapons and armor signified with blue and red icons, will have higher stats than the basic gray items, but they can be purified at a church. Purifying a piece of gear
  <strong>
   unlocks its full potential, increasing its base stats and giving it a special passive effect
  </strong>
  . Purifying gear is done at a church, with purifying being the second option. The following menu will show all the rare gear pieces you have the what the results will be for each after they are purified.

 <p>
  Unlike appraisal, the effects of purifying an item are predetermined. All items
  <strong>
   will require one Blessed Water
  </strong>
  to be purified along with a cost that scales based on the stats and rarity of the weapon. Gear pieces can only be purified once, and the bonus effects are permanent.

  Blessed Water is a fairly common item that can be picked up off the ground while in a dungeon, designated with the light blue light on the ground. These items do not respawn while you're in the dungeon, so farming them with this method is not possible. For those wanting to farm Blessed Water, they are a
  <strong>
   common drop from Imitec enemies
  </strong>
  , also known as mimics.

 <p>
  While they won't for sure drop a Blessed Water each time, players can use the Thief Archetype and use the
  <strong>
   Steal skill to always get a Blessed Water when successful
  </strong>
  . This Archetype is unlocked after defeating Heismay and getting him to join your party shortly after. While only one can be stolen from an Imitec at a time, these enemies will respawn in some dungeons, making this a fairly farmable method to stock up on Blessed Water.

      <title>EA FC 25: 15 Fastest Players, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  Speed is not everything in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  , but it is a key factor to consider when acquiring new players. While it is different from one squad to the other, most players usually consider Pace, Shooting, and Dribbling as three important factors when buying new players, especially if they are not defenders.

 <p>
  Having a player with a top-notch pace does mean they will be quick at transitioning the ball from one side of the pitch to the other, but if the pace is not accompanied by decent dribbling and physical ratings, then the player will not have much success with holding possession of the ball. However, it is still interesting to find out what players offer the highest pace in the game.

 <p>
  Transferred from rival side Al-Shabab to Al-Hilal this season, Muteb Al-Harbi is the fastest player in the Saudi Arabian league and also one of the fastest left backs overall in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . For those who are looking just for pace, Al-Harbi could be an easy steal at a really low price.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":981} -->

 <p>
  Regarding the other stats, however, the players shouldn't expect much from Al-Harbi. Despite having a pace of 93, all his other stats are below 70, and some are even below 60, which doesn't make Al-Harbi a solid defensive player, unless for those who want to recreate the current squad of Al-Hilal.

 <p>
  Despite raising a lot of interest in the transfer market throughout the years, Inaki Williams has remained loyal to Athletic Bilbao and he is still one of the fastest players in La Liga. As a wide midfielder, Williams' speed could help a lot of squads to have a fast piston on the right for attacking scenarios.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":916} -->

 <p>
  Next to his top-notch pace, Williams also has a high Physical stat, which helps him beat the defenders coming his way in 1v1 battles. This is a big plus for Williams compared to faster players like Vini Jr or Adeyemi, as they are quite easy to counter when opposed to more than one defender.

 <p>
  While having a better overall rating than Al-Harbi, Kevin Schade also does not offer anything special other than a magnificent pace rating. The player has a pretty low physical stat, but a decent dribbling rating. The latter could help him actually to benefit from his pace while performing technical move sets.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":905} -->

 <p>
  The fact that Schade is a Brentford player, could make him a cheap and viable option for improving the chemistry in Premier League-based squads, but in the long term, players will probably find much better options as a winger from the Premier League that may not match the speed of Schade but can deliver a balanced set of skills.

 <p>
  Trinity Rodman is one of the best right midfielders in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  , which comes with perfectly balanced ratings all around, making her an ideal choice for players looking for a budget squad with stellar pistons. With a pace of 94, a dribbling of 83, and a high enough physical rating, she's pretty skilled at running along the wide edge of the pitch and cutting inside.

 <p>
  The only problem with Rodman is the fact that she cannot fit into European squads perfectly. She is from the United States, and she also plays in the NWSL. So, there is no way she can earn chemistry points with a European-based squad.

 <p>
  Washington Spirit must be blessed to have two speedy midfielders on the right side of the pitch. Playing in the same position as Rodman and sharing the same Pace stat with her, Rosemond Kouassi is just another excellent pick for the budget squads.

 <p>
  Her overall rating is lower than Rodman's, and that is more significant when comparing the physical capabilities of the two players. Rodman offers better stats all around, but Kouassi might be better suited for European squads than Rodman, as she is from Cote d'Ivoire, and there are quite a lot of players from this region playing in the European leagues.

 <p>
  Although he is a Bayern Munchen player, few fans may actually know about him. Nestroy Irankuda is still quite young to be considered as a squad player in the main team of Bayern Munchen. He joined the club's second team this season but has also been registered as a viable option for the first team.

 <p>
  Irankuda comes with a superb pace and a decent physical rating, which can improve over the years as he ages. However, the other stats like shooting and dribbling need more work. He could be a decent option to apply some Evolutions onto, but overall, players can find better right midfielders from Bundesliga in the Ultimate Team at the moment.

 <p>
  AC Milan's shiny star, Rafael Leao made it to the top fastest players of EA Sports FC yet another year. He is an incredibly talented winger and arguably the best-in-class in Europe. For any Serie A-based squad, Rafael Leao is a dream pick.

 <p>
  Not only does he offer an excellent pace, but Leao is also quite skilled at dribbling, which allows him to benefit from his pace in more than just running along the edges. The physical rating is also decent, allowing him to be capable of cutting inside the penalty area and taking risky shots.

  Collecting Kylian Mbappe from a pack in Ultimate Team is everyone's dream, but all the players are lucky enough to experience it. That's when a striker like Tabitha Chawinga draws more attention. Surely, she doesn't have the skills or ratings of Mbappe, but she is the closest striker to the French star when it comes to Pace.

  Chawinga has impressive dribbling capabilities, which is almost rare for a striker. She also delivers a good physical, making her an ideal pick for all attacking scenarios, be it through balls or wide crosses.

 <p>
  Playing in the Premier League and having a pace of 95 does give a lot of value to Minteh, but he still lacks a lot of other good skills as a right midfielder. Minteh could be a solid choice for a starter squad without spending much, but as the player grows in Ultimate Team and acquires more Gold players, he will gradually begin to move away from the starting 11.

 <p>
  That being said, Minteh could be an ideal option for increasing the chemistry level in the Premier League-based squads without paying a hefty price. Evolutions probably won't improve him much, but he can later be used in completing SBCs.

  Another fast player from AC Milan. Theo Hernandez has been a crucial player for the Italian side in recent years, and having a consistently stellar performance has allowed him to make it to the top-notch defenders in the Ultimate Team for some years now.

  Theo Hernandez is one of the extremely rare players in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  who offers green-level stats in every single field. He is great at both defending and attacking. Few players have the pace of Theo Hernandez in this game, and only a handful of them can perform equally well in both offensive and defensive scenarios. Hernandez is surely a must-have for every Serie A-based squad.

 <p>
  Joining Al Ittihad will probably lower the transfer value of Diaby over time, as he is no longer the best fit for Europe-heavy squads, though the French nationality is still helpful. Diaby is a solid right midfielder with good pace and excellent dribbling skills, but he lacks a decent physical form.

 <p>
  The player is also quite weak in defensive tasks. Not an uncommon thing for a midfielder, but still a liability depending on the playstyle. The good news is applying a few Evolutions to Diaby could help him a lot with covering his weaknesses. So, he is surely an option to keep an eye on.

 <p>
  After Kylian Mbappe, Vini Jr is the most skillful player in Real Madrid and, of course, the best winger in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . His dribbling skills are unmatched, and when combined with a pace of 95, Vini Jr becomes unstoppable to every defender.

 <p>
  Not that he is superior in physical stats, but he can maneuver with the ball so fluently that few defenders can predict his next move. For players that are familiar with his dribbling skill sets, Vini Jr is the best player to pick from the transfer market, though his quite expensive.

 <p>
  For players who are afraid of fast wingers, Alphonso Davies is a solid counter that works best with Bundesliga-based squads. Due to the lack of Canadian players in major European leagues, Davies' nationality can't help much with improving the chemistry, which is the reason why he has limited usability in the Ultimate Team squads.

 <p>
  That being said, he is a viable option for every team that benefits from Bundesliga stars, and he comes at a decent price in the transfer market. He might not be as perfect as Theo Hernandez, but he is the next best thing for a similar position when it comes to Pace.

 <p>
  Adeyemi is still young and he has a bright future ahead. Borussia Dortmund's German talent could make significant progress in his stats if he takes good care of his skills, but even in his current state, he is a force to be reckoned with, especially when used in a Bundesliga-based squad.

 <p>
  Karim Adeyemi doesn't have the best physical rating, but he is indeed very fast at transitioning the ball from the defensive third to the opponent's half. Every player that counts on counter-attacks for scoring, should consider buying Adeyemi. His combination with a fast enough striker could create a deadly duo.

 <p>
  The best player in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  is also the fastest player. Kylian Mbappe features the highest overall rating in the game, and he is the only player who comes at a pace of 97. But that's not all. The player's shooting and dribbling skills also hit the 90 threshold, making him a dangerous threat to every defense line in the game.

 <p>
  Kylian Mbappe doesn't have a cheap price, but once he's in the squad, he will prove that he is worth every penny spent on him. There are plenty of excellent options for left and right wingers from La Liga, Real Madrid, and France to accompany Mbappe, which is another big plus for the young superstar.

  Battle Royale's Grand Glacier POI, they will catch a glimpse of none other than Edward Scissorhands from Tim Burton's 1990s movie of the same name. This unexpected surprise guest joins a cast of growing characters in
  <em>
   Fortnite

  thanks to the annual Halloween event, Fortnitemares. Yet, Edward Scissorhands isn't just here to trim some hedges, as he's arrived for some sweet dubs.

 <p>
  For those seeking Victory Royale with Edward Scissorhands, the time is now, as the beloved Tim Burton character brings much of his aesthetic to life, even if it does seem a tad odd or uncomfortable to hold a gun when every finger is a sharp knife.

  If players head to the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Item Shop in-game or on the web, they will be able to purchase Edward Scissorhands for 2,000 V-Bucks. The skin is a recent addition as of October 15, at 8 PM ET, and he comes with a few goodies that fans of the character can appreciate. However, it is worth noting that Edward Scissorhands surprisingly does not come with a LEGO Style to use in
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , meaning this scissor-bound Tim Burton character is relegated to singing in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival and cranking 90s in Battle Royale.

 <p>
  The reason Edward Scissorhands costs a whopping 2,000 V-Bucks is due to the fact he comes with a total of 4 items. Including his outfit, Edward Scissorhands also comes with his own Scissor Hands as a Pickaxe, the T-Rex Topiary as a Back Bling, and the three-person Ice Sculptor emote.

  For those who need even more Edward Scissorhands in their life, then they can spend 2,500 V-Bucks to grab a 5-item bundle involving the Johnny Depp character. The Edward Scissorhands Bundle costs 2,500 V-Bucks and will save players a total of 500 V-Bucks if they were to purchase the Edward Axe-Hands Guitar for the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival mode separately. The Edward Scissorhands Bundle essentially makes the Edward Axe-Hands Guitar half-price, since it's a separate purchase for 1,000 V-Bucks. Either way, here's everything in the 2,500 V-Bucks set:

  just revealed a new 12-month subscription offer full of mounts and pets, including the adorable Startouched Furline and the fiery Lava Drake. Complete with rewards for both
  <em>
   Classic
  </em>
  and modern
  <em>

 <p>
  For the last several years,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  fans who purchase bulk subscription plans have earned in-game loot for doing so, usually in the form of mounts and pets for both modern and
  <em>
   Classic WoW
  </em>
  . The 6-month rewards typically cycle out in January and July each year, while the 12-month offers refresh every October.

  for a year ahead of time not only save $2 every month, but also get the Startouched Furline Skyriding mount and the Gigantic Grrloc ground mount for modern

  <em>
   Classic
  </em>
  . If that were not enough, fans will also unlock the Charming Courier mount and Swoopy pet from the current 6-month subscription deal, plus the next mount and pet when the offer rotates in January 2025.

  The Startouched Furline is a night-themed version of the Sunwarmed Furline that came to the cash shop in October 2021, featuring a cute hooded outfit and moon-touched paws, while the Gigantic Grrloc is an orange recolor of the purple Ginormous Grrloc mount from last year’s 12-month subscription offer. On the other hand, the Lava Drake is a molten reskin of the iconic dragon model that fits perfectly with
  <em>
   WoW: Cataclysm Classic

  ’s upcoming Rage of the Firelands patch.

  This new subscription offer also teased the Lunar New Year mount and pet coming in the next six-month subscription offer. The January cycle of subscription offer rewards is always themed after the Chinese Zodiac and element of each year, as the Auspicious Arborwyrm did for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  in January 2024 for the Year of the Wood Dragon. 2025 is the Year of the Wood Snake – and the silhouette teased in the 12-month subscription offer seems to line up with that description.

 <p>
  Players can switch over to a 12-month subscription at any time between now and October 2025 to get these new items, even if they already have play time remaining. That said, the Charming Courier will go away in January when the rewards cycle out, so fans who want to pick up the current six-month subscription offer for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  will want to do so before then.

  No matter which choices you made up to that point, the Siege of Weisshaupt doesn't go well during
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Because of what happened, many Grey Wardens have relocated to Lavendel in the Hossberg Wetlands.

 <p>
  Of course, not all the Wardens are dealing well with their big defeat. It's enough to make Warden Greta nervous, which is why she sends Rook on the side quest "Lives Spared." You'll find her near the southern Lavendel beacon after the Weisshaupt quest of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

  Greta knows that several Grey Wardens have gone missing, but she doesn't know where they went. To learn more, you'll have to search the town to find clues, and the game's quest markers aren't completely helpful in showing you where to find them. Here's where to look:

  The notes reveal that the missing Wardens are trying to make up for the events at Weisshaupt, and they've gone to the Blighted Grove area to meet up. Follow the quest marker to the Grove, and search for a fallen Warden. He should be near the center of the search area, lying on a flat rock under a dead tree. Investigate him to get one more note. This will point the way to where the other Wardens went.

  The remaining Grey Wardens have gone to the Lost Village, another area in the northwest corner of the Wetlands. You may have explored this area before, but currently a blight growth is blocking the way forward. You only need to destroy one blight boil to open it up, but you'll need to use Davrin's Blight Hunter ability on the blight abscess before it'll start glowing.

 <p>
  The moment you enter the Lost Village, you'll have to fight a group of darkspawn. Fortunately, none of the enemies are especially dangerous, and they don't respawn. Once they go down, you'll need to destroy a blight tower to reach the Wardens. To activate the tower, you'll need to destroy three boils:

  Doing this lets you destroy the tower, and that lets you blow a hole in the blight on the east wall. On the far side, you can jump across the water to reach the last stand of the Wardens, and their last survivor. Before you speak to him, be sure to grab the Memento on the wall, open the chest, and pick up the Codex item next to it.

 <p>
  While the settlement system in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not be the best-received part of the game, it can still be a deep and exciting experience for players to dive into if they want. Being able to liberate a settlement and then work with the civilians there to keep it gives players a handful of places they can visit around the Commonwealth. The only issue is that there are a lot of things in the wild that want those settlements wiped out, both human and not.

 <p>
  This is why players need to arm their settlers so that
  <strong>
   they can fight off any threats
  </strong>
  that may wander too close or into their settlement. This allows players to go off and do their own thing, like completing one of the numerous side quests in the game, and the settlers can take out their enemies by themselves. However, not every weapon is as good as the rest. Just as it is with finding the right weapon for the playable character, the same goes for equipping the setters with the right weapons. Here are the best weapons to give to settlers for their defense.

 <p>
  The Minigun is not exactly the best weapon for a player to use in the game thanks to its ammo type. It can be tough to get enough to use over a long period, so players usually avoid using it except for special situations.
  <strong>
   However, this isn't the same with settlers
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Since settlers won't run out of ammo, players can give them that initial batch of ammunition, and they'll be set up with a minigun. Plus, seeing an entire settlement whip out their miniguns to take out a simple Radscorpion is
  <strong>
   one of the funniest things
  </strong>
  that can be seen in the game.

  One of the best parts of working with settlements in the game is the overall theme of the Minutemen. These characters model themselves after the famous group
  <strong>
   from the period of the Revolutionary War
  </strong>
  , and as such, it can be fun to roleplay that entire thing.

 <p>
  Equipping settlers with Laser Muskets is one of the
  <strong>
   easiest ways to do this
  </strong>
  , as the game doesn't have any actual muskets. While George Washington sure didn't sail the Delaware with lasers, this is as good as it can get and makes the roleplay a little more realistic.

 <p>
  The Institute Rifles may not be the flashiest weapons in the game, but that doesn't mean that they
  <strong>
   can't be useful in their way
  </strong>
  . They offer plenty of accuracy and are easily found in the world to give to settlers.

 <p>
  They also can do decent enough damage to take out
  <strong>
   just about any enemy
  </strong>
  that could come across the settlement. It's not going to require the settlers to get in close to their targets, so they have a better chance of staying alive.

  The AK-47 came to the game through the Nuka World DLC, offering a new weapon that can be modded to
  <strong>
   fit into several different molds

  . It can be an assault rifle, sniper, or SMG to suit any situation that may come up, especially defending a settlement.

  Even better, it has a very distinct sound to its fire compared to other weapons, which can be

   a great signal for the player.

  They hear the sound of AK's going off, and they know something is happening at a settlement nearby.

  Sometimes a player needs to decide between weapons that look cool, and weapons that get the job done easily. Or, if they're lucky, they can have
  <strong>
   a gun that does both, like the Laser Rifle
  </strong>
  . It boasts some good stats and damage, with enough accuracy to land more shots than it misses.

  <strong>
   just plain entertaining

  Not every firefight in a settlement is going to allow for ranged attacks. Some settlements are smaller than others and will require players to use weaponry that can be

  </strong>

  The Missile Launcher
  <strong>
   can be a great option
  </strong>
  thanks to its high damage. If the enemy that rolls up to a settlement is a bigger one like a Deathclaw, then a Missile Launcher is great for taking it out in no time at all. Plus, they're pretty easy to find and supply to the settlers.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic the Hedgehog
   </strong>
  </em>
  is currently running better and faster than the franchise has for years. These heights are only growing thanks to the shared spotlight between Sonic and Shadow in current series projects. Not only has
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  been released to positive reviews and praise from fans, but
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  sees the two famous hedgehog rivals duke it out on the silver screen this December.

  2024 was dubbed the Year of Shadow early on, which led to the release of
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  back in October, giving the remastered
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  a new recent counterpart in the form of
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  . Shadow's new solo campaign is the shining jewel of the collection, earning the set an 80% rating on OpenCritic, the second highest on the review aggregator under
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  . Despite this, somehow the
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  franchise has only one nomination through the
  <em>
   Knuckles
  </em>
  TV show at The Game Awards, rather than
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , which highlights some strange trends for the hedgehog and his friends at the ceremony.

 <p>
  Throughout The Game Awards' going-on ten-year history, the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  franchise has only gotten a proper nomination four times. While the fact that these nominations are more common recently seems to suggest that the series is getting noticed as its newest era is just beginning, the pieces of
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  multimedia get nominated at The Game Awards are a bit strange when looking at fan and critical reception. Currently,
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  is regularly found in the Best Family Game and Best Adaptation categories as of 2022, but only once, no matter what projects the franchise had at the time.

 <p>
  Fans could argue that
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 2
  </em>
  deserve their nominations. However,
  <em>
   Sonic Superstars
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Knuckles
  </em>
  are a bit more questionable when looking at critical and fan reception.
  <em>
   Superstars
  </em>
  is a great 2D romp with friends, but it arguably wasn't an installment worth nominating quite like
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  seven years prior.
  <em>
   Superstars
  </em>
  sits at a 60% on OpenCritic. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  earned higher reviews without getting a single mention from The Game Awards 2024.

 <p>
  This is made even stranger by the fact that
  <em>
   Knuckles
  </em>
  got nominated, when critics and fans have pointed out that the show hardly focuses on the titular echidna at all. It's often derisively called "The Wade Whipple Show" by fans, and apart from featuring Pachacamac from
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  and The Flames of Disaster and Iblis from
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 2006
  </em>
  , it did hardly any proper adaptation of the games to really qualify for the video game adaptation award. That makes the fact that
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  went without a nomination even harder to accept.
  <em>
   Knuckles
  </em>
  getting recognition for hardly featuring one
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  character while Shadow's campaign earns praise as a new gold standard for
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  rereleases seems like a baffling contrast at first glance.

 <p>
  While it may be easy to feel frustrated at the lack of appreciation thrown
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  ' way, one could argue that there was no place for it at The Game Awards this year. Sonic may have a place in the Best Family Game category sometimes, but
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  ' heavy themes of loss may have firmly kept it out of that category, alongside the fact that the collection is a single player experience.

  In terms of the other categories at The Game Awards, it's hard to say if
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  measures up to other well-received titles like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Astro Bot,
  </em>
  as 2024 was a great year for plenty of other games than just Sonic and Shadow's revisited adventure. Fans who wish to see the two hedgehogs gain some recognition should keep their eyes on the Players' Choice award once again this year, just in case it's one of the 30 voting options yet to be revealed.

  <em>

   </strong>
  </em>
  , with a handful of new bug fixes and stability improvements across both Xbox Series X/S and PC. Patch 1.1.9.0 is available to download and install now on all supported platforms, and comes just days after the highly-anticipated simulator launched to a myriad of server issues and in-game queues that left
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024

  <em>

  </em>
  , Asobo Studio announced back in June that it would be releasing a sequel in November. With its predecessor being a smash hit for its mind-blowing realism, fans were eager to see what the studio would cook up for its next installment. Unfortunately, fans were left disappointed by
  <em>

  </em>
  , largely down to the massive server issues that were present on launch day, which resulted in a large portion of the game's player base sitting in virtual queues without the ability to play. Asobo acknowledged the issues in a post on Steam, apologizing to the game's community and noting that it was working "around the clock" to provide new updates.

  Asobo's server issues have led to a negative review score for

  <em>

  on Steam, but the studio is now attempting to rectify its mistakes by releasing the game's first update. According to the official patch notes, which can be found further down this article, the new

  update aims to fix various crashes across the title to improve the overall stability and performance, while also fixing a few bugs, such as a missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in and a fix for players getting stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.

  Alongside the launch of a new update, Asobo published another post on Steam to announce it has "made continued improvements that provide smoother access to the simulator." While

  's player count quickly plummeted due to the server issues, it now appears as though things have been ironed out, meaning fans may start to return to the title and get a chance to experience the highly-anticipated sequel.

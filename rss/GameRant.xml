 <p>
  For over a century, literary monsters such as Dracula, the Mummy, and Frankenstein's monster have thrilled and chilled audiences, especially when adapted into films by
  <strong>
   Universal Studios
  </strong>
  . This has coined the common term: Universal Monsters, which has been adapted into many movies from the 1920s to the 2020s.

 <p>
  The Universal Monsters have been a staple in pop culture for decades, ranging from blockbuster movie reboots to inspiring Marvel comic books to getting video game adaptations. While the Gothic horror monster genre has only lent itself so far in video game form, some monsters have shined in the digital realms as both hero and villain alike.

 <p>
  Typically, Count Dracula is depicted as this larger-than-life villain with godlike powers, but Frogwares took a step back with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dracula: Origin
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Similar to their famous
  <em>
   Sherlock Holmes
  </em>
  games, Frogwares remains loyal to the source material, with Dracula being a tragic yet ominous figure who seeks his long-lost lover reincarnated in the form of Mina Harker.

 <p>
  Like in Bram Stoker's Dracula novel, the titular villain is not the main focus of the story, but his villainous presence is felt throughout the point-and-click adventure. Most of Dracula's story is told through research conducted by the players, who control Abraham Van Helsing on his journey across England, Egypt, and Transylvania to hunt the vampire.

  Instead of the Monster that audiences think of, the player controls a newly made creature created by Victor Frankenstein in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Frankenstein: Through The Eyes Of The Monster
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Thanks to FMV cutscenes, the player is constantly being heckled and taunted by a more sinister version of the mad doctor played by Tim Curry, who relishes a hammy yet evil performance.

 <p>
  The story of Frankenstein has always raised the question as to who the true monster is: the walking corpse or the doctor who created it. The game makes it clear that Victor is the true evil, similar to how Hammer Pictures depicted him with Peter Cushing.

  Based on the 2004 movie of the same name,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Van Helsing
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings many iconic monsters together, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, and even Jekyll and Hyde. Like the movie, the action-adventure embraces a more over-the-top gothic action-adventure to bring the monsters to life, creating a shared universe akin to a Marvel movie.

 <p>
  The game itself is a shameless clone of
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  , which fits the popcorn blockbuster style of the movie. Hugh Jackman of Wolverine fame reprises the role, adding to the faithfulness to the movie and fighting all the different Universal monsters makes for an underrated PS2 adventure, even if it doesn't do anything new for the genre.

  In one of the rare times where the game was superior to the movie,
  <em>

  </em>
  deviated from
  <em>
   The Mummy
  </em>
  reboot by creating a Metroidvania game where the player controls a soldier of the Prodigium organization led by Henry Jekyll. They must go up against Princess Ahmanet, who was the main villain of the movie, but that is the only real connection to the movie.

 <p>
  As wild and random as it is,

  . It reverses roles with Dracula as one of the monsters working for Frankenstein's Monster, who is the main villain. The Monster is that classic square-headed design reminiscent of Boris Karloff's portrayal but given superpowers.

  As the unnamed warrior, the player must fight Dracula, Death, a Wolfman, Medusa, and other monsters to make their way to Frankenstein. The result is a difficult but fun experience in
  <em>
   Frankenstein: The Monster Returns

  , especially for those looking to satisfy their Universal monster niche.

  In

They are also not easy to kill, as the player controls Sir Galahad, who is put through the wringer to slay the beasts using knives, firearms, and special gadgets.

  At first, the story of Gabriel Belmont in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  seems like a regular story in the long-running franchise. However, in a clever twist, it turns out that the main antagonist is not Dracula because Gabriel is Dracula in the rebooted timeline, showing a tragic fall from a heroic warrior to the villain that the world fears.

 <p>
  The story would even continue with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which goes full-force by allowing players to play as Dracula the vampire lord with all his godlike power to turn him into an anti-hero. This portrayal of Dracula was unlike any other in the Castlevania franchise, and possibly for the better, as it would go on to even inspire Universal movies such as
  <em>
   Dracula Untold
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In many ways,
  <strong>
   Bombs
  </strong>
  are as important to
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  as almost any of the classic weaponry. From early in the series, cracks in a wall meant it was time to hoist a bomb overhead, launch it, then collect whatever juicy loot the destruction revealed. So it is no surprise that, regardless of Link being absent from the main role, Nintendo and Grezzo made
  <strong>
   Bombs
  </strong>
  an important part of Zelda's arsenal in
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </strong>
   .
  </em>

  Thanks to
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's new Echo mechanic,
  <strong>
   Bombs
  </strong>
  come in several different forms. Before Zelda gets her hands on the more traditional form of Bombs, she will likely discover two important Echoes: the
  <strong>
   Bombfish
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Zirro
  </strong>
  . Of these two, the Bombfish has the most practical applications, so we will focus on finding them first.

  <strong>
   Bombfish

  can be found at several locations in

   Jabul Waters

  <strong>
   River
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Sea Zora

 <p>
  After you complete
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom'
  </em>
  s first major dungeon, Suthorn Ruins, you'll have the option to go to Jabul Waters or Gerudo Desert. You can either wait until this point to get the Bombfish, or you can head there as soon as you get access to the open-world. If you plan to explore early in the game, then having the
  <strong>
   Bombfish Echo
  </strong>
  will be hugely beneficial.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Zirro
  </strong>
  is another enemy that produces bombs, though in this instance it is not as practical as the Bombfish. The Zirro is a floating mushroom that drops bombs. Zelda can pick up the bombs that are dropped and then use them as she sees fit. The timing of the explosion is pretty fast, so you have to move quickly.

  Zirro are found in Eldin Volcano, not far west of the entrance to Goron City and the nearby
  <strong>
   Smoothie Shop

  . Look for bombs hitting the ground, and you'll know you are in the right area. These Echoes can be fun, but the Bombfish has far more uses.

  Just like acquiring
  <em>

  's Bow and Sword, Zelda will have to face Link's evil doppelgänger to acquire the more traditional style of bombs. In this case, Zelda will encounter Dark Link as she makes her way through Eldin Temple, the final dungeon in the Eldin Volcano region.

  Once you reach his chamber, Link will try to defeat you with bombs exclusively. First, you will stand below as he throws bombs down to your level. There is a layer of cracked blocks that make up the floor and some smaller walls on the side. As they break, you can access climbing walls that allow you to reach Link.

  You can climb up and attack Link from the high ground, using arrows or any other weapon you choose. In Phase 2, Link becomes much more aggressive, throwing multiple bombs at once. When he is defeated, he will reward you with permanent access to Bombs.

  Bombfish are the best tool to use in these instances because they are limitless. They do not rely on energy, and can be summoned anytime as an Echo. They also work underwater, though their movements can be less predictable. If you are having trouble getting them to destroy a specific object, use

   Bind

  once their timers have been triggered.

      <title>6 Best JRPGs That Let You Build Your Own Town</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  It can be costly to buy a house or to even build one. That’s why a lot of people nowadays can get their kicks not only building one house digitally, but a whole town. There have been city-building games for ages from classics like
  <em>
   SimCity
  </em>
  to more modern ones like
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . Even a game like
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  dabbles in the genre.

 <p>
  Have there been any JRPGs that have done the town-building concept well too? It may be surprising to find out that these games do have city planning mechanics in one way or another. Let’s hop to work and let these gems speak for themselves.

  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  is an action RPG with so many mechanics in it. At its core, it is a time-traveling RPG wherein the stars, Max and Monica, must go through different eras to rebuild towns that an evil mastermind is destroying. To rebuild these towns, players have to jump into dungeons randomly set up akin to a roguelike.

 <p>
  Getting different materials, including NPCs, will allow players to reset things back to how they used to be. While players are free to remake towns in their image, putting things back a certain way can get them bonuses. For example, an NPC may want to have their house by a river.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest Builders 2
  </em>
  is a sequel that lets loose on a lot of boundaries the first game had. The first game was a
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  spinoff and an attempt to take on
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  wherein players could venture out, fight monsters, and make towns. These towns reset after each chapter, making players feel like their progress was destroyed the second they pressed forward.

 <p>
  The reset mechanic was dialed back in the sequel, the combat was refined, and players were given more tools to build and craft at their leisure. Perhaps one of the best things was the co-op island wherein players could work together to build a paradise. While it still didn’t offer as many building mechanics as
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest Builders 2
  </em>
  excelled in other areas namely the RPG department.

  <em>
   Ever Oasis
  </em>
  begins with a young adventurer displaced in a desert region. To thrive, players have to create a town which will in turn help their level progression. Getting shops to get better equipment, for example, is part of the loop. There are traditional leveling-up mechanics as well and it plays like a
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  Once players get the right NPC and shop set up, many of the shopkeepers can become party members. These NPCs will have skills that can help players get through dungeons like going through small holes or breaking apart giant rocks. It’s not an RPG with a massive set of town-building mechanics, but they are at the core of the experience.

  <em>
   Fire Emblem Fates
  </em>
  was split in-between two releases at first:
  <em>
   Conquest
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Birthright
  </em>
  . Both games had a mode called My Castle wherein players could establish a town square. In this town square players could set up shops which would help the growth of their kingdom overall.

 <p>
  Each game gave a different flavor to My Castle. The family in Conquest was more medieval-like while the family in Birthright was based more on samurai. Like
  <em>
   Ever Oasis
  </em>
  , the mechanics players could wield in My Castle in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Fates
  </em>
  was limited, but it was a cool addition to introduce to the
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series.

  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  is a fairly new turn-based RPG with a pretty in-depth town-building mechanic. About a third of the way through the game, the protagonist, Ichiban, will get washed up on an island called DonDoko Island. Here he is greeted by mascots one would find at an amusement park or something.

  The goal is to clean the island up by collecting trash like cans and sweeping up sludge to make it livable again. Materials collected can be used to craft things like benches which can be placed around the island. It’s so intricate that it feels like it could be its own game. Sega may want to hold onto that idea for a spinoff in the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series who are not shy about weird spinoffs from zombie shooters to pirate adventures.

  <em>
   Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom
  </em>
  is all about retaking a kingdom. The hero, Prince Evan, gets his throne usurped by a rat-like people who invaded. To get it back, Evan is aided by the literal President of the United States who got sucked into this fantasy world. Together, they will recruit party members and soldiers to fight back against small outposts using Pikmin-like mechanics on the world map.

  There is a new castle created to act like a home base and getting enough NPCs and materials will allow players to build something new like a shop which will boost things like morale for the kingdom. These upgrades will be built in real time, meaning there is a cooldown timer and some of them take hours. It’s a bit of a borrowed mechanic from mobile-based gacha games.

  During both the intermission and the competition in

  , money spawns on the floor at different points. They come in two types, namely
  <strong>
   Pink Cash
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Gold Cash
  </strong>
  . The former will give you $1-3, while the latter offers $15-25. Of course, it is a priority to collect Gold, but the Gold Cash spawns much less frequently.

  , you should not rest here. Instead, you should try to complete the obby. Each time the
  <strong>
   challenge changes randomly

  and five minutes to choose a suitable look in

  During this, you need to use different poses to show your look from the best side. And, if most other players vote for you, you will take

  The environment is everything when it comes to
  <strong>
   horror
  </strong>
  games. Sure, adding a ton of jumpscares to the game will earn it a place in the horror genre. Yet, to truly succeed in the vast world of horror games, the environment has to be creepy enough to create that sense of unsettlement.

  This is a title that most people wouldn’t expect to see on this list. While usually termed as a shooter or a thriller,
  <em>
   Bioshock
  </em>
  has created one of the best horror environments within the horror genre. Set in an alternate reality of the 1960s,
  <em>
   Bioshock
  </em>
  lets players explore the eerie underwater city of Rapture, the home to strange mutated characters.

  The protagonist, Jack, discovers the city of Rapture after being the sole survivor of a plane crash. Confronting weird monsters throughout the game, players have to fight their way through the city while struggling with moral dilemmas. Overall, the game's art style, environment, and mechanics have made it one of the best-selling horror franchises for a reason.

  Having a unique pencil-drawn art style,
  <em>
   Mundaun
  </em>
  is aesthetically frightening. As one of the most distinctive horror games in the genre,
  <em>
   Mundaun
  </em>
  is inspired by Swiss culture and folklore. Set in a remote mountainous region of Switzerland, this game focuses on the theme of dark mystery.

 <p>
  While the environment of the Swiss Alps adds beauty to the art style, the addition of spooky landscapes, unsettling creatures, and abandoned structures makes it haunting. On top of that, the need to survive against these supernatural creatures gets the adrenaline pumping. With its environmental storytelling adding even more depth to the horror aspect,
  <em>
   Mundaun
  </em>
  is truly a beautiful yet haunting experience.

  When it comes to creating a truly haunting atmosphere, few games do it better than
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  . As a survival horror,
  <em>
   Outlast 2
  </em>
  embraces the themes of darkness and cults. The game follows the journey of its protagonist, Blake, who discovers a dark village inhabited by a cult, worshiping The Walrider.

 <p>
  The atmosphere in this game is as unsettling as it can get. As the player navigates through this village, all they have to their defense is a camera, since Blake doesn’t fight. So, the best bet is to evade and hide from evil creatures. And, keep an eye on the batteries of the camera, because if they run out, it’s pitch black darkness.

  While most horror games embrace the first-person perspective,
  <em>
   Darkwood
  </em>
  stands out by introducing a top-down system. Serving as another survival horror,
  <em>
   Darkwood
  </em>
  takes place in a dark, eerie forest filled with unforgiving evil creatures. The main task is to gather resources from the mysterious woods and survive the deadly nights.

 <p>
  Throughout the game, the player meets strange characters that add to the game's lore and depth. In addition, the game adds the aspect of a randomly generated environment. So, while the key locations remain consistent, the rest of the locations keep changing, adding unpredictability and horror. Overall,
  <em>
   Darkwood
  </em>
  does a great job of creating suspense and fear without relying on jumpscares.

  is a must-play for all horror fans.

  Widely regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  was ahead of its time. Originally released in 2001,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is set in the fictional town of Silent Hill, Maine. The game focuses on protagonist James Sunderland, who receives a letter from his deceased wife, stating that she’s waiting for him at Silent Hill.

  Lost in confusion, James visits the town, only to discover a place full of fog and dark secrets. The town serves as a manifestation of its visitors' fears, adding a layer of psychological horror. Throughout his journey, James struggles with the concepts of guilt, grief, and trauma. Overall, from its soundtracks to gameplay,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is a rollercoaster of experience. And, the multiple endings factor adds even more to the replayability.

  If there’s any game that’ll have anyone screaming at the top of their lungs in terror, it’s
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  . With a first-person system, this is one of the scariest horror games to exist within the genre. The game is set in a haunted mansion, featuring the Baker family. The main protagonist, Ethan Winters, visits this eerie mansion in search of his wife, Mia.

 <p>
  Throughout the game, players have to explore the mansion, collecting pieces of information and resources. And, as with some of the best
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, resources are scarce. So, running out of bullets mid-combat gets that adrenaline pumping like no other. On top of that, when the environment is this spooky, the scarejumps hit even deeper. Combining the factors of a terrifying atmosphere with creepy characters,
  <em>
   RE7
  </em>
  is haunting, to say the least.

  Set in the universe of the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  serves as a direct sequel to the 1979 film. As the name suggests,
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  does a great job of creating an atmosphere that makes players feel unsettled and isolated. Set in a space station, players control Amanda Ripley as she struggles to deal with an alien onboard, stalking her through the environment.

 <p>
  On top of its spooky nature, the alien learns from the actions of the player, making its moves all the more unpredictable. And, when set in an isolated environment, this becomes horrifying. With its tense gameplay and atmosphere, this game requires you to evade danger and survive, all while keeping you on the edge of your seat.

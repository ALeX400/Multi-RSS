  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  player missed out on a helpful feature in the game for three in-game years. Other
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players have shared in their commiseration, with some noting that they were oblivious to various helpful elements of the game themselves for far too long.

 <p>
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  isn't a difficult game to learn, but mastering
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is an entirely different matter. The game doesn't force players through lengthy tutorials to introduce every single element of the game, so some fans can end up overlooking details and functions that could have been helpful early on.

 <p>
  Reddit user and
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player midnightbake is one of those people, who shared how they didn't know that the upgraded watering can can water more crops at once. For three of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's years, they apparently watered their crops one-by-one or relied on sprinklers, despite having upgraded the tool. While it might strike some fans as a simplistic thing to overlook, some players noted that they had also been confused when they upgraded the watering can because of its capacity. Upgrading the watering can with Clint allows farmers to use it more per refill, so it seems some players thought the improvements ended there.

  Players Have Similar Issues With Other Stardew Valley Tools
 </h2>
 <p>
  Some
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players apparently didn't even bother upgrading some tools like the hoe, not knowing that it, too, can handle more than one square of dirt at once. This works in the same way as the watering can, as all players have to do is hold down the action key. A grid will appear on the ground, indicating where the earth will be watered or tilled, depending on the tool being used. Further upgrades expand the size of the grid, which can significantly shorten the amount of time needed to set up one's crops at the start of a
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  season.

 <p>
  While realizing a helpful detail like this was overlooked for so long might embarrass some players, many of the smaller details of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  get missed. For example, some players didn't know about
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's fishing channel, or that it's possible to regain energy in multiplayer mode via lying one's bed without sleeping for the night. Some fans consider using resources like the wiki or
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  guides to be a must playing the game due to the number of hidden mechanics and unspoken resources in the game.

  is a game that many fans enjoy playing for years on end, or who regularly revisit to start a new farm. While the player may have missed out on the watering can's full capabilities during their first three years, from this point on, farming should be a lot easier for them.

  Middle school student Koyuki Himekawa discovers that the mobile game
  <em>
   Magical Girl Raising Project
  </em>
  has a big secret. Very rarely, a player is chosen to become a real magical girl by the mascot, Fav. Becoming the magical girl Snow White, Koyuki feels as if she's accomplished her dream, but there soon arrives an announcement that there are too many magical girls. Competitions will be held to decide who loses their powers.

 <p>
  While it all seems relatively benign at first, the magical girls soon realize that losing their powers also means dying. With their lives now on the line, the magical girls begin fighting to maintain their powers and for survival, resulting in a bloodbath that belies the anime's seemingly cute premise.

  Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato get hit by a train while attempting to rescue a drunk man. To their surprise, they do not die, but instead awake in an empty apartment with several other people. They soon learn that they have been selected by a being called Gantz to fight against strange otherworldly monsters, and are given a variety of equipment and weapons to do so. They earn points for every kill they make, and if they can earn enough points, they can return to their normal lives.

  Ganta Igarashi is the only survivor of a massacre that slaughters his entire class. Framed for the murder, Ganta is sent to a prison known as Deadman Wonderland, which doubles as an entertainment park for the rich and corrupt. Fitted with a collar that injects poison into his veins, Ganta can only survive by eating a candy-like medicine, which he can only obtain by participating in the prison's many deadly games.

  <em>
   Deadman Wonderland
  </em>
  paints a unique picture of a bizarre prison where a prisoner's life is constantly on the line. While the tension of Ganta losing his life is a constant factor, the story puts more focus on the mystery of the person who truly killed Ganta's classmates, as well as the unique powers the prisoners gain while in the prison.

  Makoto Naegi is excited about going to Hope's Peak Academy, where the brightest and most talented high school students attend. His excitement is dampened by the sudden appearance of Monokuma, who declares that the students are all being imprisoned at the academy for the rest of their lives, and that they can only leave if they kill another student without getting caught. Though the students initially refuse to do such a thing, the bloody class trials soon begin nevertheless.

  Kaname Sudo receives an invitation from his friend to join something called Darwin's Game. When he does, he finds himself thrown into a real-world survival game, where one wrong move means death. Having already lost two friends to the game, Kaname decides to find the game's creator and stop Darwin's Game once and for all.

  <em>
   Darwin's Game
  </em>
  is a straightforward survival game story, where losing means death. With supernatural powers to mix up the action,
  <em>
   Darwin's Game
  </em>
  can feel like a battle manga at times, but the stakes are still plenty high.

  Ryota Sakamoto is one of the top players in a video game called

  <em>
   Btooom!

  Yukiteru Amano is a loner with no friends, other than his imaginary friend Deus Ex Machina. One day, his phone starts recording events that haven't happened yet, which are surprisingly accurate. He soon finds out that his imaginary friend is not so imaginary, and is in fact the God of Space and Time. Deus is looking for a successor, and has given several people Future Diaries in the form of cell phones. Losing their Future Diary will kill them, and the one remaining winner will be allowed to succeed him as God.

  <em>
   Future Diary

  was fairly popular when it first released, due to it featuring the yandere heroine Yuno Gasai. The series has an interesting take on the survival game concept, and its bloody and violent story has led to its popularity.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has recreated some of the game’s popular characters by using LEGO. On its release in 2023,
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  became a hit with fans and critics, setting multiple records for players on Steam and winning multiple Game of the Year awards.

 <p>
  The RPG is based in the world of
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  , and players can meet an eclectic cast of characters. Players even have the option to romance a lot of the NPCs in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , along with the flexibility to approach any situation however they want. One player has taken inspiration from this level of freedom and has come up with a clever way of taking the more popular characters in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  and recreating them in the real world.

 <p>
  One fan who goes by the username of Lopiz38 on Reddit has recreated some of the memorable characters from
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  in LEGO form by only using bricks found in the recently released
  <em>
   LEGO Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  Minifigure collection. The post shows Shadowheart, Karlach, Gale, Lae’zel, Wyll, Withers, and Astarion from the game all recreated as recognizable LEGO minifigures that come complete with similar-looking items and weapons found within
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  . Lopiz38 rounds off the collection with their own version of Tav, the default player character.

  At the time of writing, the replies to the post have been positive, with most replies praising how well Lopiz38 was able to recreate the characters from

  in such detail. Fans have already requested that the OP tackle other characters from the game, such as Minthara. The original poster sadly confirmed this wasn’t possible owing to the lack of materials from the sets to create an accurate representation.

  The versatility of the
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  extends far beyond being a handheld gaming device. It can function as a working desktop PC running its built-in Linux OS, or players can use it as a retro gaming device to play classic games using an emulation program.

    Updated September 4, 2024, by Michael Llewellyn:
   </strong>
   The PS2 emulator is a powerful progam that works beautifully through the EmuDeck program. The EmuDeck program allows users to run multiple emulators at once and play their favorite games via the Steam Deck's Gaming Mode. However, with the handheld receiving frequent updates, players must enable Developer Mode to maintain the program's functionality. As such, this guide has been updated to include the steps that must be followed to install Developer Mode on the Steam Deck.

     Be sure to check the Developer Mode settings after every major update. These updates can occasionally switch off CEF Debugging by default.

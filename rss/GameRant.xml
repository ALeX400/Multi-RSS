  Obsidian Entertainment's hit survival exploration game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grounded
   </em>
  </strong>
  sees players shrunken down to the size of insects as they attempt to survive in what is, at times, a very inhospitable backyard. With plenty of RPG mechanics, there are many different ways in which players can approach the game. A wide variety of weapons, armor, and mutations enable deep customization and can vary playstyles dramatically.

  From powerful melee classes to light and dextrous archer builds, players have sought all kinds of combinations of tools in order to craft the most effective "builds." While it is up to each player which style or build they would prefer, some do carry advantages that are hard to compete with in terms of sheer power within the game. These are some examples of the most fun and experimental builds in

    Updated October 2, 2024 by Andrew McLarney:
   </strong>
   Grounded has recieved several updates over the course of its lifespan so far, with some introducing new weapons and mutations, while others have nerfed certain overpowered weapons and given players more of a challenge again. Each build focuses on a different combination of weapons and mutations, and all are relevant as of Patch 1.4.5.

 <p>
  The Stun Prodder is one of the more eccentric and interesting builds to play and represents a fun challenge for players who may be looking for an alternative approach to the game. While it is still relatively overpowered, the Stun Prodder build focuses on stunning enemies and bludgeoning them once they are in their stunned state. This works either against single or multiple enemies since the upgraded Prod Smacker has an Area-of-Effect ability.

 <p>
  As a primary weapon, the maxed-out Stun Prodder will provide a powerful charge and will be capable of causing great damage to enemies too. The Entomologist Badge accessory will further this damage output, and Black Ox Armor will provide adequate protection. Meat Shield, Coup De Gras, Cardio Fan, and Trapper Peep.r make for the best mutations with this build.

 <p>
  This interesting summoner build focuses on maintaining a distance from enemies and getting a legion of small spiderlings to do all the work instead. It is a diverse build, enabling players to utilize many different weapons and experiment with different playstyles all the while grounded in a summoner build. The aim is to cause chaos and overwhelm enemies with a variety of attacks from different sides, all the while debuffing enemies and gaining extra reinforcement throughout.

 <p>
  Using the Bard's Bow and Whittle Widowling Charm in combination with the Bard's Tudor, Moth Armor and a combination of the Sharpshooter, Mom Genes, and Bardic Inspirations mutations are the basis for this build, though players can also use Apex Predator to summon wasps or Mansterious Stranger to summon Mants.

 <p>
  This build centers around the use of spears and corrosive damage to wear away enemies' defenses as well as mitigate any incoming damage - it is also especially useful when dealing with termites, particularly with salty damage. Many of the elements required to craft the items in this build are relatively easy to acquire, making it an interesting and fun build for newer players looking to experiment with varied builds.

 <p>
  The build uses any spear, though the Rusty Spear packs decent enough damage, combined with Fire Ant Armor and a Fire Ant Shield for that extra corrosive bonus. In addition to this, the Thor's Pendant trinket will provide a 10% bonus to almost all the player's stats. As for mutations, Javellineer will provide extra spear damage, along with Trapper Peep.r which can provide bonus critical chances. Meat Shield is also recommended as this build is focused on being up close with enemies.

 <p>
  The Scarlet Lifesteal build is one of the most overpowered builds in the game, and centers around constantly healing while stealing lifeforce from opponents. While it may be difficult to use against some of the more powerful bosses with strong attacks, it is generally a very solid build which should deal with the vast majority of enemies in the game.

 <p>
  The Tick Macuahuitl applies the lifesteal effect to all attacks, regenerating the player's health at a rate of 6% of damage dealt when upgraded. The FIre Ant Shield provided good protection against Corrosive attacks, which are a weak point for this build. The Ladybug armor set will improve the rate of healing, and is fundamental when combined with the Tick Macuahuitl to making this build so powerful. The Meat Shield and Parry Master mutations also combine will to increase defence and health overall.

 <p>
  While much of
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  's gameplay and mechanics may lead players to prefer a melee build, there are still many interesting ways in which players can construct highly effective ranged builds. The Ultimate Archer seeks to utilize all of the game's best weapons and perks for ranged builds, leading a deadly, assassin/hunter-like build that will enable fans to pick enemies off from afar without ever putting themselves in real danger.

 <p>
  Using the Insect Bow along with Feather Arrows will be extremely effective in combination with a maxed-out Sharpshooter mutation. The Marksman's Cap will also provide additional bow damage, and the Aphid Slippers will provide a bonus to movement speed, allowing for the Ultimate Archer to traverse the surrounding environment quickly, while simultaneously unleashing a hail of devastating ranged attacks.

 <p>
  The Punch-Out build is designed to maximize the potential of an unarmed build, which involves various powerful mutations as well as some strong armour. It is a good build for fighting against bosses and enemies who take a lot of hits, since there are some nice stackable effects which can be enhanced through repeated hits.

 <p>
  First, players will want to ensure that they have the strongest armor possible, so the Mother Demon armor set along with the Fire Ant Shield is a good way to go. No primary weapon is needed, since the build focuses on using raw punching power. For mutations, Little Fist is the most important as it will double punch damage and increase with consecutive hits. Parry Master and Coup De Gras are also important mutations for this build as they focus on melee attacks. Mom Genes and Mansterious Stranger can also help by generating minions during combat.

 <p>
  The Mad Whacker build focuses on maximizing the potential of one of the game's strongest weapons, the Pinch Whacker. When fully upgraded, this weapon combines a steady swing speed with high amounts of damage. Despite being slightly nerfed over several updates, players can still get a lot out of this weapon by combining it with the right mutations.

 <p>
  The Mad Scientist mutation is a must-have as it will increase the attack speed and damage of the Pinch Whacker with each consecutive hit. The mutation will also provide a random buff until combat ends when using this weapon. Parry Master is another important one for all melee builds, and players can choose either Meat Shield or Trapper PEEP.R depending on their personal preferences. Coup De Gras and Spicy Safety are also worth considering for their powerful melee enhancements.

  The Ox Wizard is a versatile build making use of staffs and strong armor, resulting in a great balance of both offensive and defensive capabilities. Utilizing the ability to freeze, burn and shock enemies, this build is capable of taking on most enemies in the game. For flying enemies, the Sour Staff can shock them out of the sky, while the Spicy Staff and Mint Staff will also deal with various enemies vulnerable to their respective damage types.

 <p>
  The Ox Wizard utilizes all three Staffs and switches between them, while also equipping the Entomologist Badge accessory will provide a bonus to damage output. The Ox Wizard, perhaps unsurprisingly wears Black Ox Armor from head to toe, and for mutations, Meat Shield and Spicy Safety will increase survivability, while Cardio Fan and Buff Lungs will increase stamina. Finally, Whittle Wizard is essential for this build as it will increase the power of all staffs.

  As many players will know, poison can be one of the most effective damage types to use in the game as it will affect the majority of enemies and can stack up on a single target. Even after the latest patch in which poisons were nerfed slightly, it is still the best overall damage type around which to arrange a character build.

  This build centers around using the Widow Dagger with a shield. Sarah's Charm can be equipped to make this melee build easier to maintain. The Mask of The Mother Demon will provide bonuses to poison, as will the Widow Spaulder and Widow Leggings. In addition to this, the Assassin, Meat Shield, and Coup De Gras mutations will also accentuate the strengths of this particular build.

  The recent announcement of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
   </strong>
  </em>
  has come as a surprise to many fans, with the upcoming project only reinforcing the very impressive rate at which Ryu Ga Gotoku is developing fresh games for the franchise. The game will see iconic character Goro Majima once again take on a protagonist role, with Majima becoming the captain of his very own pirate ship operating off the shores of Hawaii.

 <p>
  The trailer for
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  focuses primarily on Majima as well as a vibrant cast of brand-new characters, with the narrative and setting of the project seemingly being quite far removed from the major events and figures of the wider franchise. While this alone will provide an enjoyable experience, there is still a chance that
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  will surprisingly feature appearances from other main characters like Kazuma Kiryu or Ichiban Kasuga, and it might be best for RGG to leave this as a secret in the run-up to the game's release.

  Smaller-scale spin-off titles are once again becoming a dominant aspect of the
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  franchise. In the past, the mainline
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games were supplemented by the likes of
  <em>
   Dead Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ishin
  </em>
  , which took the IP to wildly different time periods and locations, but the modern
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  spin-offs have found a way to provide this experience while still adhering to the main story and canon of the series.

 <p>
  This was seen more recently with the release of
  <em>
   The Man Who Erased His Name
  </em>
  , which took the series back to beat-em-up combat with Kiryu in the protagonist role, and the upcoming
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  is extending this tradition with Majima. It appears that this will herald a new era of
  <em>
   Gaiden
  </em>
  -style games for the
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  franchise, and
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  can smartly hone in on the fascinating elements of Majima's character that are not afforded enough screen-time in the massive narratives of modern mainline
  <em>
   LaD
  </em>
  titles.

  Majima was fleshed out the most as a character in the events of
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  , and with four decades of plot having occurred since then, it's high time for the fan-favorite character to regain the hot seat. The trailer confirms that the plot of
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  will revolve around Majima suffering from temporary amnesia, allowing the player to get a glimpse into his true mindset without the eccentricity and guard of his past trauma.

 <p>
  The current state of the wider
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  narrative is quite an emotionally charged time for Majima, with his long-time rival and close friend Kazuma Kiryu suffering from cancer. It is confirmed that
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  will take place six months after the most recent story of
  <em>
   Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  , meaning that Kiryu's ultimate fate has a chance of being confirmed in the upcoming game. This would be a major moment in the franchise's story, and the potential appearance of Kiryu or even Ichiban in
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  's biggest narrative moments should come as a total surprise to the player. While certain editions of the game already offer the likes of Ichiban and Kiryu to appear as pirate crewmates, it seems that this is purely cosmetic, with proper narrative appearances still being up for debate.

  Major characters have made surprise appearances in recent
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  titles to great success, with Majima himself even making a shocking entrance in 2020's
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like a Dragon
  </em>
  . This same impact can be recreated in
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  by maintaining a level of uncertainty around which characters will actually appear in the game, with the concept of Majima as a pirate captain being enough to lure fans in without the promise of other beloved characters appearing. While the appearance of other iconic characters may give the narrative of
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza
  </em>
  the late-game emotional punch that it needs, fans should be able to get fully lost in the title's tropical world without initial memories of the past, much like Majima himself.

  With the latest State of Play, gamers got a look at the next chapter of the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima

  franchise. Titled
  <strong>
   <em>

  The upcoming Sucker Punch game is a standalone sequel set 300 years after the events of
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  . It takes place on Mount Yotei, found in the heart of Ezo, today known as Hokkaido. In the early 17th century, this area was outside the control of Japan, and it didn't feature the organized samurai clans of Tsushima Island.

  Mount Yotei is also known as Ezo Fuji, due to its conical shape causing it to resemble Mount Fuji. The Ainu referred to the mountain as Makkarinupuri or Machineshiri, meaning female mountain. This could hint that
  <em>

  </em>
  's female protagonist Atsu will be thematically represented by the mountain, just as Jin is the storm personified in

  Ghost of Yotei is Set in an Interesting Time Period

 <p>
  During the early 17th century, Japan was entering the Edo period, which lasted until 1868 and is marked by Japan being under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. Though this is recorded as a relatively peaceful period, there were some conflicts such as the Seige of Osaka. This was also a time when the concept of ninjas was much more solidified, thanks in part to the Iga ikki confederacy of ninjas based in Iga Province during the Sengoku period of Japan. This gives Sucker Punch a lot to draw from historically when fleshing out the "ghost" aspects of the new protagonist.

  Nature is an important element in
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , and this is seen with the prominence of the wind, used for stylistic purposes and to help players navigate the island. The importance of nature is also highlighted by the wildlife that Jin interacts with to find points of interest. It appears that nature will be a prominent part of
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  , and developers have recorded nature sounds at Shiretoko National Park.

  The park can be found at the northeastern tip of the island of Hokkaido, which is one of the most remote regions of Japan. When speaking to
  <em>
   The New York Times
  </em>
  , Sucker Punch creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell claim that seeing Mount Yotei was the inspiration for setting the upcoming game in the region. Shiretoko National Park is also listed as an influence, and Fox describes it as an "incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water." Despite its beauty, the park is a dangerous place, as Fox highlights, and visitors are warned about bears.

  Sucker Punch has chosen an intriguing location and time period when it comes to

   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , the studio will do its research and deliver an experience that is historically faithful while not sacrificing the fun factor of video games.

      <title>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Could Have Worked Wonders With One of Link’s Awakening’s Best Features</title>

  After impressing
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  fans with the acclaimed
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  remake. Grezzo has returned to do it all over again. However, this time, the studio is blazing its own trail and telling a brand-new story with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . For the first time in the mainline series, players are now experiencing a Princess Zelda-led tale filled with all the classic action-adventure goodness they have come to expect. And while it has been a great adventure, there is one fantastic feature that
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  seems to be missing.

  In the
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  remake, Grezzo introduced the concept of the Chamber Dungeon. This feature lets players customize dungeons and then share them with others to see if they can make it through. Although limited, its existence proved extremely popular, as dungeons have formed the backbone of the entire franchise for years. With the addition of
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Echoes, the feature could have been taken to the next level. But, sadly, it did not make the cut.

  Zelda: Link's Awakening's Chamber Dungeon Was a Great Feature
 </h3>
 <p>
  After the success of
  <em>
   Super Mario Maker
  </em>
  , all eyes were on what other Nintendo franchises might be able to take a similar concept for a spin. Luckily, they would not have to wait too long as
  <em>
   Zelda: Link's Awakening
  </em>
  would end up delivering on that potential with Chamber Dungeons. Replacing the Camera Shop, the Chamber Dungeons served as a brand-new form of side content that dungeon divers could spend hours exploring. Not only did it allow them to customize their own dungeons, but it also served as a great way to earn rewards.

 <p>
  The feature was rather limited, as players could only rearrange the chambers of pre-built dungeons. It may not have been the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  maker some fans were looking for, yet it was a start. It showed that the studio was interested in exploring the concept, and future titles had the chance to take it even further. So, it seems strange that
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  would drop it entirely, especially since that game began its life as a dungeon maker of sorts.

  In a recent Ask the Developer at Nintendo, the studio revealed that one of the original plans for
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  was for it to be focused on customizing dungeons. An early version of the game gave Link the ability to copy and paste objects to create original dungeons, with that concept seemingly driving the development. But, after a year, that concept was replaced by the Echoes players have today, with the dungeon editing feature falling by the wayside.

 <p>
  After spending a year building this game as a dungeon maker of sorts, it seems strange that
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  does not include any sort of Chamber Dungeon-like feature. Additionally, Grezzo was the one who first introduced the concept into the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise, so it would only make sense for the studio's second outing to expand upon it greatly. Plus, with the introduction of Echoes, that feature could have been a true game-changer.

 <p>
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has given Princess Zelda the ability to place down all sorts of different objects throughout her journey. Through those powers, players could have built some fantastic dungeons if given the chance. Maybe they wanted one built around bed puzzles, maybe they wanted another filled to the brim with Bokoblins, or maybe they just wanted a peaceful dungeon with breakable pots around every corner. Whatever form of dungeon they dreamed of
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  could have been the place to build it. But since it did not include it, hopefully, the next Grezzo
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game will.

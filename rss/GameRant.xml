	While
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Ravenswatch
	 </strong>
	</em>
	, the latest punishing roguelike from developers behind
	<em>
	 Curse of the Dead Gods
	</em>
	, is very early in its full development, there's still a ton of depth to the game.

 <p>
	Across the 8 playable characters currently, in
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	, there are a multitude of Talent options that can appear as they level up, each one greatly changing how certain playstyles or abilities work. With that in mind, which ones seem to be the strongest so far for each character?

		Updated May 28th, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
	 </strong>
	 Since the original publishing of this list, Ravenswatch has gone through quite a few updates and general content additions. There are a whole lot more systems in the game now, 2 more playable characters, entirely new stages, a 'final boss' of sorts, and more unlocks for each Hero than ever before. With that in mind, a lot of Talents have been slightly adjusted over time or just reworked entirely, and some characters even had a whole bunch of new Talents added to their pool. So, let's take another deep look at all the Talent options players can pick from during a run in Ravenswatch, and which 5 Talents for each character are the absolute best of the best.

 <p>
	Little Red Riding Hood, better known in this game as Scarlet, is obviously the rogue-type character of
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	. Her abilities are all centered around quick slashes, critical hits, and stealth...at least until the sun goes down. The overall 'vibe' of this setting absolutely gives off some
	<em>
	 Dark Souls
	</em>
	vibes, and the Day/Night cycle helps with this tone even more.

 <p>
	A ton of her potential upgrade options are based around letting her pump out even more absurd bursts of damage or improving upon her default playstyle, which is great. Though to be fair, this also means that many of her Upgrade options don't exactly 'change' the way she's played, which is either a pro or a con depending on the player.

	It feels odd to say that the man with the rats and flute is the 'gunner' of the group, but it really is true with the Pied Piper. He's the only character in
	<em>

	whose attack feels like it's pulled right out of a twin-stick shooter instead of a more typical roguelike.

Additionally, Pied Piper's Defense is his best tool for accumulating Stagger, so players should already be using it near enemies all the time.

 <p>
	Beowulf, while the most 'simple' character in the game to play, is also one of the better options and also a character that fits this game's art style almost perfectly. The raw damage this character can put out when needed is staggering, and that's not even including his Wyrm-enhanced versions.

 <p>
	Currently in the Early Access state of this game, Ignite stack damage scales of the attack stat, which makes almost all of his Ignite-based Upgrades a must-have. Just keep in mind that there are other great options and that Ignite's scaling will very likely change over the course of the game's development.

	Calling the Snow Queen the 'mage' character of
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	might seem appropriate at first glance, but it's not entirely accurate. Almost all of her Icy abilities require her to get up close and personal with her enemies, and she's much more centered around the Chilled Ailment than raw spell damage.

 <p>
	Let's be frank here, Aladdin is pretty broken in terms of power with the current state of
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	. The sheer ability to instantly spawn multiple Magical Objects and tons of Dream Shards right as the game starts (especially if it's a multiplayer lobby) is beyond overpowered.

 <p>
	So, any of the Upgrades that give him more Wishes or are related to them in any way are worth grabbing. Still, the rest of Aladdiin's kit is also good, and the other Upgrade recommendations are mostly based on capitalizing on his maneuverability and the instant DPS of his Power ability.

 <p>
	Melusine is by far the most unique character in terms of play style, though there is an argument to be made that Geppetto is more unique. Regardless, her whole kit is built around this sort of 'move, bunker down, deal damage, move again, repeat' gameplay loop. So, a lot of her best Upgrades tend to utilize this play style in some way. Additionally, there are a few upgrades for Melusine that, when taken, make her by far the best Support option in Multiplayer, so those are a must-have as well when possible.

	Both Geppetto and Sun Wukong were characters added to
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	after it originally came out in Early Access, with Gepetto coming out May 31st, 2023 and Sun Wukong coming out November 16th, 2023. Geppetto is a very unique Hero to unlock and play, as he is a 'summon' type character, but unlike most summon-type characters Geppetto is truly nothing without his summons (in this case, Dummies).

 <p>
	Gepetto's core gameplay loop revolves around placing Dummies, using Power to launch them into the fray, letting the Dummies take aggro so Geppetto or his allies can get some safe hits in, and repeating that process. So with that in mind, Geppetto's best Talent options usually revolve around making this gameplay loop even safer or adding more damage on top without much risk. Here are our personal picks for his strongest Talents overall:

	Sun Wukong in
	<em>
	 Ravenswatch
	</em>
	is the very definition of a high-risk, high-reward character. One of his two Stances, for example, causes him to take 100 percent more damage from enemies (in exchange for dealing 100 percent more damage as well). Thankfully, his other Stance is based around regaining any health lost, so he has a pretty well-tuned kit for keeping himself alive, provided he uses his Defense properly and knows when to go in and when to duck out.

 <p>
	A
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Pokemon
	 </em>
	</strong>
	fan has recently designed a new regional form for Tropius using Mount Fuji as inspiration. Regional forms were first introduced in the seventh generation of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games, and have been hugely popular in fan art since then, as they allow for reimagining popular monsters with a different type.

 <p>
	Tropius is a Grass/Flying-type Pokemon that first appeared in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
	</em>
	. The sauropod-like creature does not have any evolution, and it can only be captured on Route 119, making Tropius a somewhat rare beast. After its debut, Tropius was obtainable in most of the franchise’s newer titles, including
	<em>
	 Pokemon X and Y
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Scarlet and Violet
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	Now, an artist called pianotat decided to create a regional variant for Tropius. However, instead of making an art piece inspired by one of the regions featured in the franchise, the artist decided to use Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji instead. This new version of Tropius is a Rock/Fairy-type creature and comes with a few interesting changes. For starters, the Pokemon is now blue and light pink instead of green and brown, with its new colors representing both Mount Fuji and cherry blossom trees. Apart from that, this new creation still has the same long neck as the original monster, but instead of wings that look like leaves, it has a long coat seemingly made out of cherry blossom leaves.

 <p>
	This is not the only fan-made artwork giving Tropius a new form that has been shared with the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	community recently. Last week, a fan created a baby form for Tropius called Platiny. This new design looked like a cute brown and green dinosaur with a banana peel on its head.

 <p>
	Last year, another fan created a Mega Evolution for Tropius. This creation resembled a more mature version of Tropius, still keeping the same overall design, but using brown leaves instead of green ones, which evoked the idea of an Autumn-inspired version of the Gen 3 monster.

	Regional forms may have first appeared in
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games years ago, but they continue to be popular. A few days ago, a
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fan designed a new regional variant for Larvitar and its evolutions. In this form, the Pokemon was represented using blue, white, and grey colors, and it had pieces of crystal all over its body. The creature’s last form, Tyranitar, was greatly inspired by the classic
	<em>
	 Godzilla
	</em>
	villain SpaceGodzilla, according to the artist, looking a lot like a mighty kaiju.

	<em>
	 Rapid Rumble
	</em>
	offers players various mini-games that can be played either solo or in teams. The reward for victories is FreshTix, the main currency of the title. But, at first, earning them is pretty hard. Therefore, developers regularly add different codes to
	<em>
	 Rapid Rumble
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	As always, these codes can provide you with free rewards in just a few clicks. More precisely, they will help you get a lot of FreshTix right from the first few minutes of the game. But, you should use them as quickly as possible since they are active only for a short time.

	The main motivation of players in
	<em>
	 Rapid Rumble
	</em>
	is the in-game currency. And this is not surprising, since FreshTix can be used to purchase many different UGCs. These items will make your avatar unique. However, some UGCs can cost several thousand FreshTix. Therefore, to earn them faster, you should use
	<em>
	 Rapid Rumble
	</em>
	codes.

	players aren't thrilled with the way that fences decay in the game, but the community is coming through with methods to avoid the mechanic. While some would like to see

	quality of life improvements that make it easier to tend to normal fences, these suggested methods can offer a workaround.

 <p>
	In
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	, there's a few elements that players need to keep an eye on around their farm beyond the crops themselves. Weeds popping up over time, for example, can damage crops, fences, and other tools on the farm. Fences break down over time, requiring players to keep an eye on them and replace any missing parts as they become damaged. However, there are some ways to fence off one's farm without relying on fences that break down.

 <p>
	Reddit user GeraldoofRivia took to the
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	subreddit to lament the way that fences work in the game. While it depends on the type of material used, all fences in the game eventually break down, which can allow animals to get out of their enclosures or mobs to get in on the Wilderness Farm. It's possible to use a Gold Clock to stop the fences from decaying on the farm, but as GeraldoofRivia points out, that takes time and a lot of money to acquire. However, for players who are sick of this problem themselves, there's another workaround: using unusual items as fences.

	How to Avoid Fence Decay in Stardew Valley
 </h2>
 <p>
	One player by the name of jiwufja suggested that players can use
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	's Tea Saplings as fences. These saplings can be placed across every square, don't decay, and don't require any watering. As Tea Saplings remain unless removed by the player, they make an excellent way of creating a permanent fence. Starting in the
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	1.6 update, Tea Saplings that get chopped down drop a replacement sapling, so players can easily move them if they need to expand the space or otherwise change the fence arrangement on their farm.

 <p>
	Another player, JackSilver1410, suggested using Lightning Rods to construct a fence. While
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	's Lightning Rods can be destroyed by spawning weeds, as long as the weeds on the farm are well-controlled, it shouldn't pose much of an issue. It also comes with the added benefit that when a thunderstorm comes, the player can generate a lot of Battery Packs in a single day.

	These methods offer an excellent way of keeping yards fenced in without having to worry about fixing things. However, fans like GeraldoofRivia still wish that there were other methods to keep fences intact for longer - or permanently - when choosing a standard fence for both esthetics and function.

 <p>
	Fortunately, redeeming
	<em>
	 Anime Spirits
	</em>
	codes is not difficult. The whole process of redeeming will take you no more than a few clicks. However, if you are experiencing any problems or have never redeemed
	<em>
	 Anime Spirits

	codes before, follow these steps:

 <ul>
	<li>
	 Launch
	 <em>
		Anime Spirits
	 </em>
	 .
	</li>
	<li>
	 Pay attention to the bottom-left corner of the screen. Above the HP and stamina bars, you will see the Menu button. Click on it.
	</li>
	<li>
	 You will see plenty of buttons arranged in a row when you open the menu. Among them, find and interact with the first one that says Codes.
	</li>
	<li>
	 After doing so, you will open the redemption menu. There will be an input field and a black Redeem button below it. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.
	</li>
	<li>
	 Finally, click on the black Redeem button to submit your reward request.
	</li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1089} -->

 <p>
	If everything is done correctly, you will see a notification at the top of the screen with a list of rewards received. Thus, you will need to redeem every active code if you want to get all possible rewards. Hurry up because each code has an expiration date, after which they become invalid and offer no rewards.

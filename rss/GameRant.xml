 <p>
  Many people assume that most JRPGs have linear storylines where players can't stray from the beaten path barring the odd sidequest or two. While this may be true in the majority of instances, some JRPGs try to stray away from the tropes this genre has been associated with in this department. This has led to players enjoying numerous titles that have done a great job of letting them enjoy non-linear storytelling that grants some agency over the game's narrative progression.

 <p>
  Players can either muck about for hours on end or trigger story sequences in whatever manner they see fit, allowing them to enjoy some fun story segments and some engaging side content at their leisure. Some may prefer a linear sense of progression instead, but there's no denying that
  <strong>
   non-linear storytelling feels more player-driven and adds to the novelty of these unique JRPGs.

  One of the greatest sequels of all time,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Octopath Traveler 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  did a great job keeping players engaged with stellar gameplay, eight memorable protagonists, and storytelling that had its highlights despite some recurring problems from the first game. Each party member's story occurs in a vacuum where the other protagonists are sidelined whenever the narrative kicks it into high gear. This may be a problem for some players, but the travel banter that the party engages in is pretty frequent and helps the cast feel more cohesive than in the first game.

 <p>
  It helps that there's a proper ending to the game that ties everyone's narratives together in a neat bow and ensures that players won't be left hanging after completing each of the eight narratives. This grand finale is a treat for players who progressed through every character's chapter, regardless of the order they completed them, and the end credits do a fine job of showing this non-linear progression by adding scenes from each boss fight in the order that players tackled them.

  Despite an ambitious narrative for an SNES JRPG, it was a shame that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Live a Live
   </em>
  </strong>
  never made it to the West. Thankfully, Square Enix decided to remake this title with their signature HD-2D style for the Switch, allowing players around the world to enjoy one of the most underrated JRPGs of all time, where they can progress through chapters in a non-linear manner while slowly uncovering an intriguing narrative.

 <p>
  Each chapter focuses on a character facing off against a great evil that incorporates the name Odio in some form or another. All of this culminates in two chapters that detail the descent of this antagonist into evil and the heroes coming together in a final chapter to lay waste to Odio's evil once and for all. It's a unique way to approach a JRPG narrative, and players can choose the path of evil too and take out the heroes if they wish, in an excellent non-linear narrative that pulls no punches.

  The World of Balance is mostly linear, barring a segment where players are allowed to choose between three parties when the heroes part ways. It's a nice way to integrate a non-linear section in the first half of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  and serves as a taste of things to come. After Kefka disturbs the balance of the World of Ruin and lays waste to the world, players take control of Celes in the World of Ruin as she strives to reunite the gang and give them the motivation they need to take on Kefka once again.

 <p>
  Stopping this would-be god from causing unchecked mayhem and destruction is easier said than done, and players must explore the world and recruit heroes old and new to face off against Kefka. It's here that the non-linear progression of
  <em>

  rears its brilliant head, with players exploring areas in any order and helping the narrative progress as they see fit leading up to the final fight.

  Fans were been pining for Game Freak to make full use of the Switch's hardware, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Scarlet &amp; Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  seemed like a step in the right direction. The idea of playing an open-world
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game excited many, and the potential of a grand adventure in this game was enhanced considerably when
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  let players fulfill this fantasy. While the game's technical issues and a lack of level scaling were called out by many, there's no denying that the latest
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games have gone a long way in evolving the series.

  If players want to challenge themselves, they can take on tougher gyms with higher-level Pokemon for a rewarding experience. Conversely, they can also smite low-level gyms to gain a sense of satisfaction after putting a lot of work into strengthening their party. This sandbox structure allows for seamless non-linear progression as players enjoy a unique personal journey to becoming a Pokemon master.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has spent an incredible amount of resources to power up their nundo Bidoof. In
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , players search for powerful and rare monsters to add to their collections. But the gameplay experience goes beyond that for some, with them showing their love for even the most regular pocket monsters.

 <p>
  And one of these monsters adored by
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers is Bidoof. Introduced in Gen 4, the Normal-type became highly popular largely because it was often used to learn HMs, earning it the nickname “HM Slave.” But over the years its fame went much further, leading The Pokemon Company to create “Bidoof Day” in 2021, which has since been celebrated annually on July 1. The first celebration of the date is also remembered for the release of the short film “Bidoof's Big Stand,” showing all the love for the charismatic rodent.

 <p>
  Demonstrating that it is also popular among
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players, one trainer spared no expense to power a nundo Bidoof. On Reddit, a user named Alextricity showed their Bidoof with only 78 HP and zero attack, defense, and HP points. In the second image, they reveal the resources used to power up their Pokemon; a whopping 496,400 Stardust, 268 Bidoof Candy, and 296 Bidoof Candy XL. As a result, the little guy that previously had only 226 CP jumps to 560 CP. In comparison, the maximum CP the Normal-type can have is 815 when it reaches level 50.

  The idea of powering up a nundo Bidoof got amused reactions from other
  <em>

  players, who humorously commented that they had “caught God” and “won the game.” Other players used the comments section to showcase the Bidoofs on their collections, including a trainer who owns a nundo. One of the comments suggested that the OP use it as a Buddy Pokemon and level it up until it becomes a Best Buddy, something they revealed they were already doing.

  While Alextricity went viral by upgrading their Pokemon, this isn't the first time a trainer has shown off their nundo Bidoof. After all, although hundos are highly coveted because they are the stronger variant of the pocket monsters in Niantic's game, nundos are not far behind in popularity. Even though they are useless in combat, these Pokemon have an emotional and collector's value, and several members of the community even consider them rarer than hundo, making the capture of a creature of this type equally celebrated.

  A massive leak has hit Game Freak, revealing an enormity of information about the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise. Nicknamed the 'Teraleak', this explosion of information has unveiled, among other things, a smorgasbord of details pertaining to scrapped
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  critters.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series' major leaks have produced a near-endless well of development info for games past and upcoming, detailing unreleased Pokemon, future releases, prototypes, and scrapped character bios. Related to the last category, one scrapped lore story about Typhlosion blew up in particular—its contents akin to the creepypastas about Hypno or Drifloon. Game Freak has since issued a statement about the leaks, stating that, in addition to franchise information, 2,000 pieces of employee information were unfortunately released to the public. Game Freak apologized for the oversight, and has said that it will be contacting affected employees where it can.

  In addition to upcoming and prototype Pokemon being leaked, a good number of scrapped Pokemon have also been discovered. These unused Pokemon have been collected by u/vagrantwade on the r/PokeLeaks Beta Leaks Megathread. In this post, the 'Gen 3 Prototypes' spreadsheet doc can be found (originally compiled by The Cutting Room Floor), which shows off all the lost Pokemon that have been unearthed. Most fall into two broad categories: Orange (those likely to have been scrapped before February 2002) and Pink (those likely to have been scrapped after March 2002). Exact dates are extremely fuzzy, so these benchmarks shouldn't be taken as gospel.

  Orange is certainly the largest category out of the unreleased Pokemon found in the leaks. Many of these creatures have names that haven't undergone the changes most Pokemon receive, chiefly that each name is scarcely deviant from the original Japanese. An example of this in these leaks is the Pokemon Wailmer, shown here to have once been named 'Hoeruko'.

  As with other Pokemon leaks, small details have flown as readily as the big. Many Pokemon listed include developer notes, many of which are evidence as to why these Pokemon were ultimately left behind. The bug-like Bii, purportedly replaced by Wingull, has the note 'I would change the colours'—which lines up with the switch to Wingull, another flying Pokemon but with a different color scheme. Some Pokemon, such as Sudowoodo and Keromeelo, were deemed too similar to other Pokemon, while others received more lukewarm remarks like Rikugin's 'I like the idea, but...'.

  Monorabi, a Pokemon that looks like if Eevee was a fire-type, got one of the least flattering critiques, a simple note that reads 'looks deformed'. Just like other Orange-category Pokemon, all of which purport to be scrapped before February 2002, Monorabi has very few details in its bio—whereas some Pink-category Pokemon have small stories attached.

  Starter Pokemon are among the most iconic for their respective generations, but some get left behind. An example shown in the document is the Pokemon Warabitto, a rabbit-like creature wearing a life preserver who was once destined to be a Gen 3 starter.

  Based on the concept art originally depicting Warabitto, fans have been able to piece together that the rabbit was once going to be the Water-type starter. This means that Warabitto was replaced by the beloved Pokemon Mudkip, though it seems that many fans wouldn't mind Warabitto making a comeback, with the aqueous rabbit fast receiving its share of fanart.

 <p>
  Pink-category critters got further than other Pokemon in the leak, but are unlikely to ever see the light of day. Nonetheless, the fact that these Pokemon got a tad further than those in Orange means that they have more stories to their name. Archeon, for instance, has a number of 'Undecided' notes about its traits, namely that 'its scales have formed into wings' and that 'it has not changed its appearance since the age of dinosaurs'. In fact, other notes in its spreadsheet section call it a 'living fossil', with feathery scales strong enough to cut iron.

 <p>
  Uulon is another Pokemon with thorough lore, with numerous descriptions of its nomadic nature. Puruun is similar, with a good amount of detailing surrounding its diet and love of flight. Evolotto is an odd case with this, as much of the lore surrounding this canceled Pokemon pertains to its ability to evolve into any Pokemon—a trait almost akin to Ditto's core abilities. However, its 'Unconfirmed' section of notes suggest that it evolves through 'transformation' and into 'various' different Pokemon, which muddles the true nature of its concept even further.

 <p>
  Still, as with other parts of these Pokemon leaks, some scrapped Pokemon in the Pink category have critiques attached. Some of these are, again, criticisms related to Pokemon that look too much like their peers, such as Otoma's note 'I want it to be less similar to Poliwag'. More humorous is Kodomon, who's labeled with the note 'Looks like Dragon Quest', which could refer to its smiling face and wide eyes, which are indeed similar to Dragon Quest's famous slimes.

 <p>
  Excitingly,
  <em>

  is introducing some new content and features that fans have been hoping for. One of the most interesting among these is the ability to revive deceased

  subjects, including the castle's leader. Users will need to acquire a Soul Gem to do so, which can drop from Legendary Packs or Heirlooms, with a shop addition to come later on. Dynasty levels have been increased to 300, Sheogorath's Gauntlet has been rebalanced with a chance at unique loot, and players will be able to play the game across multiple devices.

  <em>

  is also introducing a friends and leaderboards system. Players will be able to compare their progress to users everywhere, or just with the friends they have that are also playing the game. The friends system sounds fairly minimal at this time, as there are no mentions of any social activities or ways of assisting one another. However, this could change in the future. Lastly, the game is also adding the option to play in either Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish, and players dissatisfied with their
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls: Castles
  </em>
  subjects or progression can reset completely to level 1, allowing players to start from scratch.

  Given the support that
  <em>

  has received from the developer, players should expect
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls: Castles

  to see many future updates and fresh content added to the title in the months to come.

      <title>Throne And Liberty: How To Get Vitalstones</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/throne-and-liberty-how-get-vitalstones-gigantrite-stellarite/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The Gigantrite has quickly become a sort of mascot for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Throne and Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  since its release; the giant flying whale has become a popular destination for the game's players as they seek to take a ride across Solisium's skies on its back. Of course, the reason they are seeking out the large creature is not just for the fun of it, as the Gigantrite also plays a role in some of the game's quests. As more people have hopped aboard for a flight, many are starting to notice
  <strong>
   various spots around the animal's back that are asking players to have a Vitalstone
  </strong>
  in their possession to interact with them.

 <p>
  While the game clearly asks players to have a Vitalstone to
  <strong>
   interact with these parts
  </strong>
  on the Gigantrite's back, it isn't very clear how to get these items — or even what they are in the first place, similar to other items. A dive into the game's lore will show that they are crystals that hold a good amount of Gigantrite blood in them, and they also possess large amounts of Mana. For those who are looking to get ahold of their own so that they can hop on the whale and use them as intended, this guide has all the information to help do just that.

 <p>
  The Gigantrite itself is the source of the Vitalstones as anyone who is nearby during its flight will notice that it will occasionally
  <strong>
   shed a bunch of items off of its back
  </strong>
  . At these times, players can see a bunch of sparkling trails descending from the whale, signifying that it has shed some Vitalstones.

 <p>
  The problem is that the stones don't always land right where these trails do on the ground. Instead, the Vitalstones seem to appear at set locations nearby where the trail hits the ground. This makes
  <strong>
   following the Vitalstones difficult from the ground
  </strong>
  , which means the best way to track them is to get on the Gigantrite's back.

 <p>
  Staying near its sides, players need to watch out for the shedding to occur, at which point they need to jump off and glide down close to where the sparkling trails are heading. They need to watch for another glowing light to appear on the ground, at the bottom of which
  <strong>
   will be the crystal they are looking for
  </strong>
  .

  Another problem is that each Vitalstone can only be mined by one player, and
  <strong>
   it won't be available to everyone
  </strong>
  . Once a player has gotten to it, it will disappear for everyone else. This makes it a bit of a race for anyone who is looking to get one as they have to reach it before anyone else can.

  Fortunately, if a player is able to get to the crystal, they can get a good chunk of Vitalstones and Rare Marind to add to their inventory. These can then be taken on top of the Gigantrite to
  <strong>
   exchange for Stellarite Element
  </strong>
  , which, in turn, can be used to craft Stellarite. This can be used to
  <strong>
   deal 10% damage against enemies in the game
  </strong>
  , so it's certainly a useful item to have.

  The
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series is full of epic empire-spanning stories that fans will find easy to get into, and
  <em>
   Genealogy of the Holy War
  </em>
  is no exception here. The plot is set in the continent of Jugdral, which is rife with conflict that's orchestrated by a maniacal cult.
 </p>
 <p>
  The plot takes place over two generations and is as epic as it sounds. After working in the interests of Grannvale, players band together to take out the cult fracturing this nation instead of engaging in meaningless infighting with other countries.

  game with impeccable writing. The overbearing sense of dread that encroaches on players as the world inches closer to destruction is something that will unnerve fans time and time again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world of Termina serves as a darker take on the upbeat land of Hyrule and features some creepy NPCs and monsters that Link must take out. It's an adventure full of memorable events that will leave behind a lasting impression after players finally avoid the destruction of the world.

  One of the strongest parts of
  <em>
   Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem
  </em>
  is an ambitious story that spans across millennia and is as unnerving as they come. Switching between perspectives across these timelines lends to the narrative's epic feel and helps it stand out in the eyes of many.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with this, the engaging survival horror gameplay and ingenious fourth-wall breaks help
  <em>
   Eternal Darkness
  </em>
  stand out as one of the most underappreciated Nintendo games of all time. The combat may be rather janky, but that's a small complaint in the grand scheme of things.

  Out of all the games in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  series, most people consider
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  to boast the best story. The gameplay can be frustrating in the eyes of many, but people won't mind mastering the motion controls as long as they get to enjoy the game's grand narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  The compelling setting of the game coupled with its placement at the very start of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  continuity gives its story a ton of leeway to tell an original tale that isn't bogged down by the past. Link's adventures to acquire the Triforce and take out the foes standing in his way are a huge part of what makes
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  such a magical experience.

  There is a surprising number of merchants that the Sole Survivor can buy goods in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Most sell similar things like ammo, food, junk, etc. Some of the merchants have rare and unique items that are available for purchase. These rare and unique items can make it much easier to survive in the Commonwealth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the player is interested in solid armor pieces that boost their stats, one-of-a-kind weapons with special rare effects, or lots of junk, there are a few merchants that are worth paying a visit to pick up their cool and unique pieces. Just keep in mind that some of these items aren't cheap, so it's important to load up on Caps first.
 </p>

  <em>
   The traders of Fallout 4 all have interesting stories to tell. The original list covers all of the core traders alongside some of the lesser-known ones. This update will go into more detail regarding the background of some of the traders mentioned below.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some traders have lived their lives in isolation, while others have built up a well-earned reputation for being rather dangerous individuals. For those who enjoy learning about various NPCs, this update will offer plenty of information about some of Fallout 4's local traders. This update will also update some of the listed items sold by the vendors to showcase more of their stock.

    <p>
     It is important to note that players can get their hands on some great merchants at their settlements. However, only one of them made it onto the list below. This is due to bugs. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that affect settlement merchants in
     <em>
      Fallout 4.
     </em>
     These bugs can make it impossible for console players to trade with certain settlement merchants.

    Junk, Random Items:
   </strong>
   A Random Array Of Items (Can Sell The Reckoning When Assigned To A Weapon Shop)

   <strong>
    A Recruitable Trader
   </strong>

 </ul>
 <p>
  Smiling Larry is one of the most difficult merchants to track down. He is a random encounter that players can trigger by visiting certain locations on the map. Since there's no guarantee that he'll spawn, the player may need to repeatedly reload their game to find him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the player has found Smiling Larry, they can purchase his wares. He doesn't have all that much in his inventory.
  <strong>
   However, if the player recruits him and sends him to one of their settlements, then he can be placed behind a Trading Emporium, and he will sell the Reckoning
  </strong>
  . This weapon is a unique variant of the Ripper. It makes whoever uses it take 15% less damage while standing still. While it's not exactly the best weapon in the game, it is still surprisingly powerful, and definitely worth picking up. It is worth noting that there have been some issues around players not being able to talk to Smiling Larry, but this issue seems like it's mostly limited to those on PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smiling Larry sees himself as a very well-known individual. One of the things he says when asked about his story is "The whole Commonwealth knows me." Fans never find out if this is true, or even if it is a good thing. However, it's interesting to see how this traveling merchant sees himself.

   He Sells Two Unique Legendary Weapons, The Admiral's Friend And The Fish Catcher. He Also Sells A Healthy Mix Of Random Items
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After arriving at Far Harbor, one of the first merchants the player will come by is Allen Lee. This guy is relatively nice, provided the player isn't rude. He is the owner of the Gun Store and he sells some pretty interesting things. His collection of items does change every couple of days, however his best items are two unique weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Players can purchase the Admiral's Friend and The Fish Catcher from Allen Lee
  </strong>
  . The Admiral's Friend is a harpoon gun that does double damage if the enemy hit is at full health. The Fish Catcher is a unique pole hook. Its legendary effect allows players to attack enemies for 40% less VATS points. These weapons can be pretty fun to use, and with the right perks, they can be quite powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the things that the player learns about Allen Lee very early on is that he has a strong hatred for the Children Of Atom. He is also much more aggressive than Captain Avery and wants to take a more heavy-handed approach when dealing with outsiders and the Children Of Atom. While the player can eventually earn his trust, his dislike for outsiders remains.

    Chems:

   A Healthy Selection Of Narcotics
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Slim doesn't get mentioned all that often. While he is a somewhat niche trader in terms of popularity,
  <strong>
   his stock of Chems
  </strong>
  is enough to keep all addicts fueled and ready for action.
 </p>
 <p>
  He can be found slightly west of Hester's Consumer Robotics and east of D.B. Technical High School. Because of where he is based, it's easy to miss him. He doesn't have anything unique, but for those who can't get enough Chems, he's a great vendor to visit. One notable thing about Slim is that, unlike many other traders in
  <em>
   Fallout 4,
  </em>
  he can actually be killed. Should he come under fire from nearby enemies, there's a chance that he will die.

  Located right in the center of Diamond City, Myrna is a strange character. Her distrust of people probably doesn't help her business. But, for those who are willing to put up with her poor customer service, she's one of
  <strong>
   the best people to go to in the Commonwealth for junk
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Since junk is needed for crafting and settlement building, she can be a very useful trader to visit. While she's not so crucial early on, as the player unlocks new settlements, they will quickly find themselves needing more junk for building purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Myrna's hatred for Synths is no secret, it goes a lot further than most residents of Diamond City think. Unbeknownst to most of the other residents, Myrna had been working on a plan to persuade the mayor to prohibit anyone suspected of being a Synth from entering the city.

  Arturo is Diamond City's biggest seller of weapons and armor pieces. His inventory is extensive.
  <strong>
   He also sells a Power Armor Frame
  </strong>
  and most types of ammo. He's a popular vendor in the game that most players visit regularly to stock up on supplies.
 </p>
 <p>
  He's the perfect vendor for endgame settlement building. Not only does he sell aluminum, but his extensive collection of weapons and armor can come in handy for kitting out settlers with items to fend off any attackers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arturo took over the weapons store in Diamond City from his father. He's a man with only one thing on his mind. He has a daughter, Nina. He wants his daughter to live in a safe place. To help ensure that she remains safe within Diamond City, Arturo tends not to get involved in other people's business.

  Kleo is an interesting merchant as she is the only Assaultron in the game that works as a merchant. She resides in Goodneighbor, and according to her, she has a weapon for every situation. She's a funny character due to her dark sense of humor and is quite well-liked among the residents of Goodneighbor.
 </p>
 <p>
  While she may be a fairly popular resident, should the player hack her terminal, they will discover that she had quite a sinister plan for a few of her neighbors. Her plan involved a lot of murder. Luckily, her plan didn't take shape.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for her wares, there is one item that makes her a pretty interesting merchant: the Partystarter. The Partystarter is a unique missile launcher that can be purchased from her. While it isn't the best weapon in the game, it is really fun to use.
  <strong>
   She also sells two other one-of-a-kind items
  </strong>
  . They are the Devastator's Chestpiece and the Devastator's Right Greave. They are both unique armor pieces that are worth picking up.

  Cricket is a traveling merchant that is primarily based in Bunker Hill. She can be found wandering and selling her wares in various places across the map, such as Diamond City and Vault 81. While she may look feeble, she is hiding a secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  She is actually an informant on Runaway Synths for the Synth Retention Bureau. While this is pretty interesting, the reason why she makes such a great merchant is down to one thing that she sells:
  <strong>
   the Spray n' Pray
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a very powerful weapon that can take down pretty much every enemy in the game. It is a submachine gun with a very powerful effect in that it offers explosive damage. This means that each shot deals 15 points of explosive damage. With the right perks, this can be an incredibly powerful weapon.

  Alexis Combes can be found in Vault 81. She is the vault's local merchant. She sells a variety of items,
  <strong>
   including some of the rarer building materials, like fiber optics and nuclear materials
  </strong>
  . There are a few reasons why Alexis is a great merchant. Firstly, players can get a 10% discount on her wares if they save Austin's life during the "Hole in The Wall" quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only this, but she also sells a few one-of-a-kind items, like the Overseer's Guardian. This is a unique combat rifle that shoots two projectiles instead of one. She also sells three unique armor pieces: the Destroyer's Right Leg, and the Overseer's Left and Right Arm. Thanks to the 10% discount, she is a very good vendor to go to for the rare items mentioned above and to stock up on junk for building and crafting.

  Players first encounter the Vault-Tec Rep before the bombs drop. He is the salesman who visits the player's home just before the attack on Boston. The rep survives the blast and is turned into a Ghoul. Despite this, he hasn't lost his charm as a salesman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can find him in Hotel Rexford in Goodneighbor. After chatting with him, it is possible to convince him to come and set up shop in Sanctuary Hills. It is here that he can become a useful merchant to the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   He can be assigned as a level four merchant for the trading emporium
  </strong>
  . This is the highest level a merchant can be. He sells a great selection of rare junk like military duct tape and military ammo. He also sells the Apocalypse Left Greave, a one-of-a-kind piece of armor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can buy his junk, scrap it all, and reset his inventory by waiting two in-game days. Because he is located in Sanctuary Hills, it is much easier to store all the junk that the player has purchased, making him one of the best merchants in

  Proctor Teagan can be found on board the Prydwen. He sells a variety of items, but most of the items he sells aren't particularly interesting. That is, with the exception of some unique armor pieces and weapons.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important to note that most of the unique items sold by Proctor Teagan can only be obtained after the player has completed certain quests for the Brotherhood of Steel. Doing certain missions for the BOS will award players with various ranks.
  <strong>
   Upon reaching certain ranks, more rare weapons and armor will be available for purchase from Proctor Teagan
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Proctor Teagan sells more unique weapons and armor pieces than any other single merchant in the game
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Because of this, he is seen as one of the best merchants in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . Unfortunately for Proctor Teagan, he is confined to his cage. His job is to ensure that nothing goes missing. So, he is locked in his cage all day every day.

However, you'll also notice that some of the equipment or upgrades require a special type of currency called Battle Honors. Since the steps to earning these currencies aren't exactly made clear in the game, here's exactly

 <p>
  To Earn Battle Honors in
  <em>
   Door Kickers 2: Task Force North
  </em>
  , players must complete Campaign missions and earn stars.
  <strong>
   Each 7 stars you earn in a Campaign mission
  </strong>
  rewards you with
  <strong>
   one Battle Honors
  </strong>
  . So, if you take on a Campaign that has missions, you can potentially earn up to 3 Battle Honors.
 </p>
 <p>
  New players will find that the missions are grayed out when they enter the Campaign menu. To unlock these missions, you'll first have to complete several solo missions.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_7">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     You can see the number of solo missions you need to clear in order to unlock a campaign by hovering over the grayed-out Campaign.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Thankfully, once you unlock a Campaign, you can replay it as many times as you want. However, these missions are much more difficult compared to solo missions; the maps are generally bigger and feature much more enemies. If you want to succeed, make sure your Squad is decked out with the best gear available.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Continue:
   </strong>
   Extend the Campaign's duration and fight for 7 more days.

 <p>
  Additionally, if you want to earn more rewards during a campaign, you can turn the
  <strong>
   Iron Man mode
  </strong>
  on when starting a campaign. This will give you double the rewards you earn, including Battle honors. However, it will also activate
  <strong>
   No Restart
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Permadeath
  </strong>
  modifiers, which can make the Campaign a lot more challenging.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Campaign mode in
  <em>
   Door Kickers 2: Task Force North
  </em>
  can be quite difficult early on. If you're having trouble with it, consider unlocking Doctrine upgrades and buying better weapons and gear by completing Solo Missions. Eventually, you'll unlock more Campaigns and will be able to rack up all the Battle Honors you need with a fully upgraded Squad.

  RPGs are often lengthy games with worlds and narratives that grant both developers the freedom to explore various themes and players the chance to experience different lives. This makes it a genre filled with diversity, offering countless ways to tell compelling stories through its mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  While many lean into fantasy settings, as seen in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5
  </em>
  , others take inspiration from historical events or different cultures around the world. So, the best RPGs based in the real world are those that successfully blend fantasy with authentic elements, creating an adventure that remains engaging and immersive for players.

  The
  <em>
   Expeditions
  </em>
  franchise explores different historical moments of humanity, such as the conquest of the Americas and Viking voyages, but one of their RPGs that best embraces this realistic setting is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Expeditions: Rome
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Set in the Late Roman Empire, the game casts players as a young legatus whose father was assassinated, forcing him to flee in haste.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, while gathering power to return to his homeland and avenge his deceased father, players embark on a journey through the military campaigns undertaken by Rome during that period, venturing into regions such as North Africa, Greece, and even Gaul. Another aspect that
  <em>
   Expeditions: Rome
  </em>
  handles exceptionally well is showcasing the Roman culture of that era, carefully detailing the customs and social differences.

  One of the best tabletop RPGs successfully adapted from books to video games is
  <em>
   <strong>
    Vampire:
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Masquerade - Bloodlines
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which blends all the elements of traditional tabletop RPGs, including a dark fantasy setting based in Los Angeles. Here, due to a series of societal laws and customs, vampires must hide from humans while still vying for power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, even though the game does not offer a grand representation of Los Angeles, opting instead for smaller sections of the city. it still does an admirable job of conveying and simulating an urban environment. This grants players significant freedom to explore the story in various ways, considering that each available clan has access to unique powers that affect gameplay in different manners.

  One of Ubisoft’s great traditions with
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  has been to faithfully reproduce various historical moments and places in its games, as seen in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed: Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which takes players on a journey to Ancient Egypt. Consequently, many buildings and monuments from that era are recreated in the RPG - even if on a smaller scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is even possible to visit the pyramids of Egypt during their peak, experiencing the sites as they were originally constructed and planned - often even more beautiful and impressive than the ruins seen today. Other historical landmarks also appear in
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed: Origins
  </em>
  , making the game perfect for those passionate about that era of civilization.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  , like the other games in the franchise, portrays a retrofuturistic world devastated by nuclear war, combining this setting with Old West culture. Set in Las Vegas and its surroundings, players can explore places like the Mojave Desert and the Hoover Dam, experiencing the struggle between factions for control of the region amid post-apocalyptic chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what is most interesting about
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  is that it takes the concept of a real-world-inspired RPG to another level by incorporating many elements of 1950s North American culture - whether as parody or in a more serious manner. In this way, the game is a perfect treat for fans of the genre who appreciate this type of setting.

  One aspect the
  <em>
   Yakuza/Like a Dragon
  </em>
  franchise has always excelled at is portraying the wide array of activities available in Japan, offering players an authentic depiction of different cities across the country along with an enormous variety of minigames. This is also evident in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Yakuza: Like A Dragon
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which features the Kamurocho district as one of its primary settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, for players who enjoy JRPGs with a modern setting, especially those based in Japan, the game performs remarkably well by providing a strong focus in exploration and considerable freedom. Even though the district in
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like A Dragon
  </em>
  is fictional, numerous references to Tokyo and local culture can be found throughout the map.

  also features detailed recreations of Shinjuku and Kichijoji, broadening exploration opportunities within the JRPG. Thus, while battling demons and fighting societal injustices, players can visit various locales inspired by real-world places, making the experience even more immersive.

   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the greatest references and also one of the best RPGs inspired by real-world locations, as it takes players on a journey to the 15th-century regions of Trosky and Kuttenberg in Bohemia. Furthermore, the game places a strong emphasis on exploration, offering an open-world map filled with various missions and easter eggs to be discovered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to its focus on recreating Bohemian settings,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  also emphasizes realism not only in its environment but in its gameplay as well. Thus, during Henry’s journey, players must deal with some complex mechanics that greatly affect gameplay, such as the need to eat and keep the character clean at all times - adding survival elements to this RPG.

  Sony’s
  <strong>

  has been around for a couple of years by this point, granting it plenty of opportunity to build up an expansive library capable of catering to the needs of most users.
  <strong>
   New PS5 games
  </strong>
  drop at an almost daily rate, ranging from smaller-scale indie projects designed by a handful of developers to massive AAA exclusives that are designed to be system sellers. In the meantime, the PlayStation 4
  <strong>
  </strong>
  continues to receive love with cross-generation titles, so people who have yet to upgrade still have plenty to look forward to.

  January started 2025 positively, setting the stage for a packed February that could prove to be the year's strongest month. Nearly every week has had notable
  <strong>
   PS5 games
  </strong>
  , and quite a few of them are time-sinks that could stick around for years.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  builds on its predecessor's realism to provide an immersive action RPG set in a Medieval open-world, and it will almost certainly go down as one of 2025's best releases of its genre. That said, the game caters to a pretty specific niche, so players unfamiliar with the series should check out some gameplay footage before investing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  has been a long time coming, and it shakes up the core formula by quite a bit.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  will probably not be as drastic of a departure as
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  , and Capcom's project looks fantastic so far. The franchise has gone fully mainstream by this point, and
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  could be its crowning achievement.
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  seems awesome and weird.

  While very much a work in progress, March 2025 is starting to take shape, with several relatively big (but niche) PS5 titles slotting into the month.
  <em>
   Two Point Museum
  </em>
  will hopefully build on the success of
  <em>
   Two Point Hospital
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Two Point Campus
  </em>
  , providing a wacky but detailed management sim that is accessible but also deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster
  </em>
  should make two classic JRPGs available to a modern audience; meanwhile, people craving a full-blown new entry in the genre should keep an eye on
  <em>
   Atelier Yumia
  </em>
  . While intense battles are always a blast, sometimes nothing hits the spot like a relaxing escape from reality.
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could offer that.
 </p>
 <p>
  March 2025 really is packed with exciting games.
  <em>
   Carmen Sandiego
  </em>
  is targeting an early release, and it should make for an interesting take on the IP.
  <em>
   The First Berserker: Khazan
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   AI Limit
  </em>
  seem set to be new additions to the Soulslike RPG genre, which is always exciting. Finally, Hazelight is making its big comeback with
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  , a co-op game that should be among the feature's best representatives of 2025.

  Honestly, April 2025 is still mostly a blank slate, with only a small handful of upcoming PS5 games declared for the month. Still,
  <em>
   Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves
  </em>
  should be one of the year's best fighting games, and the available footage has been exciting. Beyond that,
  <em>
   Mandragora
  </em>
  looks like a promising 2D action game with Soulslike gameplay. Sure, these types of releases are very common nowadays, but they tend to be surprisingly consistent.
  <em>
   Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade
  </em>
  also looks neat.

  At this stage, the 2025 video game calendar still has a long way to go, and there is a chance that the year's biggest releases have yet to be announced. That said, several massive projects have tentatively declared plans to launch within 2025, although they have not committed to specific dates.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Pathologic 3
  </em>
  are just a handful of sequels/prequels that seem likely to launch by the end of the year, and they all could be phenomenal.

  As games spend years in development, plenty of projects are known to be in the works but have yet to announce anything resembling a release year.
  <em>
   Wolverine
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Infinity
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Phantom Blade 0
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  continuation, and
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  are some of the biggest games in the works, all of which will attract plenty of attention once they debut. Most of these titles are presumably a few years away.

  The Surf Cube is a useful utility item that allows players to jump on a constructed surfboard to skate on roads, air, and water. There's no power in the Surf Cube that players can use for fighting, but it's a great tool for escaping fights, allowing players to soar through the air with fairly decent speed so that they can get away from hostilities. While the Surf Cube is nice to use, it really doesn't offer much protection, and players will have to dodge and weave in the air if they are to use it for its only function, which is to escape.

  The Tracking Visor allows players to activate a scan across the battlefield, providing an 80-meter radius that can reveal anyone within the vicinity. Anyone caught in the area is revealed with a bold red highlight, even if they're hiding behind walls. This lasts for 8 seconds, and players can scan the area again every 25 seconds. Not only can the Tracking Visor track enemies, but it can also see footprints, ensuring that players know where their next prey is heading. The biggest problem with the Tracking Visor is that it's only good for revealing nearby enemies, and it's not good for actually causing damage unless players want something to stop them from being flanked or surprised.

  Another useful utility item that will get players where they need to go is the Bass Boost, a fun item that will fire waves of energy that can be used to either impulse players away, destroy structures, or launch you into the air without the fear of fall damage. While the Bass Boost is useful for getting enemies out of their cowering structures, it's also greatly effective in removing yourself from the fight, as players have a few charges that they can use to not only launch themselves into the air but to propel themselves forward or backward to escape a deadly scenario and live to tell the tale.

  Myst Form is another utility item where players can use it for one purpose: escapism. The Myst Form ability will see players enter into an invulnerable flight mode for 4 seconds, with a cooldown of 20 seconds. These 4 seconds provide players with the inability to avoid getting hurt, and they can fly up and go far with great speed to avoid enemies, or get closer towards them. However, the Myst Form is still just a utility item with one use, and won't be the catalyst for success.

  The Myst Gauntlets will see players fire a barrage of ravens from their palms, and each raven will hit for around 12 damage. With so many ravens being sent out at once, players will have an intense DPS to use on their enemies. The Myst Gauntlets might have high DPS, but the damage isn't the most satisfying unless players are fighting a horde of multiple foes, since the damage has a great spread thanks to their cone-shaped blast radius.

  The Killswitch Revolvers are a dual-wield weapon, allowing players to carry two revolvers at once so that they can double the trouble and damage against their enemies. The Killswitch Revolvers are a fun weapon to use in the meta, with fairly decent damage that's only further aided by the fact that when you jump while in midair, you will enter a slow-motion mode. In this slow-mo, players will have superior accuracy and a height advantage that allows them to look as cool as Neo from
  <em>
   The Matrix
  </em>
  or Max Payne from
  <em>
   Max Payne
  </em>
  as they experience their own bullet time.

  An item so powerful, it's had to be removed not once, but twice. The Storm Beast's Pom Poms might seem like a cute cheerleading accessory, but they actually transform the player into a deadly and hungry storm beast. The storm beast transformation is quick and provides players with plenty of health to tank shots from enemies. Their sprint is faster, their jump is long distance and spammable, and the attacks from each powerful move will certainly destroy those whom the storm beast hunts, allowing for this superpower to go unmatched in most matches.

  The Kryptonian Form became active on July 11, 2025, providing players with an opportunity to turn into Superman himself. This ability was truly unique, and like Godzilla in previous seasons, only one player would be able to claim this prize. It's a first-come, first-served situation, where players can race to the center of the map for the Kryptonian Form. What awaits is a transformation into Superman, where players can fly through the sky at quickened speeds to reach their enemies, and use heat vision and punches to destroy anyone in their path. Each elimination is more health for Superman, meaning the most effective players can grab this Superman ability and win the game with the utmost ease.

      <title>Rumor: Battlefield 6's Battle Royale Mode Might Not Be Available at Launch</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-when-rumor/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  A new rumor from a credible source claims that EA won't be launching a Battle Royale mode alongside
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as it will arrive "months" after the base game is launched. While there have been plenty of rumors surrounding a potential Battle Royale mode for
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  , it looks like the studio is still hard at work on its development, as new information suggests fans may even have to wait until early next year to play it.

  Some lucky
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  fans have been going hands-on with the next entry in the franchise via closed playtests throughout the year, but those who weren't so lucky were finally given their very first look at
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  with an official reveal trailer on July 24. The trailer focused solely on the shooter's single-player campaign, complete with some epic gunfights, explosions, and more. Those looking to see even more of the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game will have to wait until July 31, as EA has confirmed a multiplayer reveal for
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  will take place then.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Battle Royale games being all the rage in recent years, it's no surprise that there have been rumors claiming
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  will also have a Battle Royale mode. However, the shooter may be following in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  and launching the mode "months" after the base game's release. According to Kick streamer RivaLxfactor, two inside sources have told the content creator that the mode will be free-to-play but "won't come out till months after the base game." However, the streamer did note that plans could change behind the scenes between now and its release.

  EA has yet to confirm when the next entry in the series will be released, but there are rumors that claim
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  will launch in October. If these rumors prove to be true, the shooter's Battle Royale mode might not be available until the Holiday season or even early next year. However, this isn't unheard of.

   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  is now one of the biggest Battle Royale titles around, but it didn't come until five months after the release of 2019's
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  . Whether or not EA feels delaying the release of
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's Battle Royale mode is good for marketing, or if it's just simply not ready for release yet, remains unknown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without confirmation of a Battle Royale mode, fans are already extremely hyped for the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game. In just one hour after its release, the reveal trailer for
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  racked up more likes than
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  's, which has been available online for well over a month. Yesterday's trailer managed to pull in almost 200,000 likes in its first hour, while the next
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game's first trailer has only accumulated 140,000 likes in over a month.

      <title>5 Best Open-World Games That Are Spiritual Successors, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-open-world-spiritual-successor-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Players love the idea of old and respected video games receiving spiritual successors that carry forward their vision with a fresh coat of paint. While the optimal solution is for these classic titles to become long-running series, this is a decent compromise, especially once players realize that the new IP can be largely original while retaining the special bits that made the original franchise such a blast.
 </p>

 <p>
  Some of the best open-world games players can get their hands on now owe their success to the titles that inspired them. The new games feature quality storytelling and worldbuilding of their own while allowing players to witness a perfection or evolution of gameplay tropes from another notable video game that had such a major impact in the gaming industry that they've shaped wildly successful spiritual successors.

  There's no denying that
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  is one of the best platforming franchises of all time, with
  <em>
   The Sands of Time
  </em>
  trilogy having all the ingredients for an incredible video game experience. However, the series lost a ton of its momentum over time, to the point where Ubisoft wanted to do something different with this series. An idea thrown into the mix was that players wouldn't control the Prince himself, but a bodyguard or someone else in a similar position who would protect their liege.
 </p>
 <p>
  This idea morphed into something special, leading to the creation of the first
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game. While the sandbox design in this series would need some improvement, the unique setting, compelling story, fun traversal, and a great mix of combat &amp; stealth ensured that Altair's adventures would mark the beginning of something special.

  Despite what its name suggests,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  doesn't have a major connection to other entries in the series. Instead, it's styled as a spiritual successor of sorts to the
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  series, which is odd but not something fans will dwell upon.
 </p>
 <p>
  It helps that
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  is bursting with excellence, allowing fans to drop into this title without a second thought, even if they aren't familiar with other games in the series. It boasts a unique edge and what many fans consider to be the best open world in the series, which is hefty praise indeed.

 <p>
  With the popularity of
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  skyrocketing, other developers wanted a piece of that sandbox pie. This led to the rise of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  clones, with
  <em>
   True Crime
  </em>
  being one of the more notable titles to experiment with this sandbox.
  <em>
   True Crime: Streets of LA
  </em>
  was a fun title that was worth checking out for fans of Rockstar's crime series, but the same can't be said for
  <em>
   True Crime: New York City
  </em>
  , which was rushed out and littered with bugs that took away from a game that already lacked innovation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another
  <em>
   True Crime
  </em>
  game was stated to be set in Hong Kong, but poor critical and commercial performance meant that the IP was shelved after just two releases. However, from the ashes of this Hong Kong crime game rose
  <em>
   Sleeping Dogs
  </em>
  , an incredible open-world adventure with fun combat and a surprisingly great story that is hailed by many as one of the best action-packed open-world games fans can get their hands on.

  It's a shame that not many people are aware of Ico, with players more familiar with titles like
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Last Guardian
  </em>
  instead. In the case of the former, the title serves as both a spiritual and actual successor to Ico, featuring a unique story where players control a hero who must take out sixteen colossi to revive the love of his life.
 </p>
 <p>
  In doing so, he makes a deal with a vengeful entity named Dormin, who is released after the colossi are taken out. However, this malicious being is sealed in the nick of time, but Wander himself has regressed to become a child as he's held in the arms of the woman he once loved at the end of the game.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is in a rather odd position when it comes to spiritual successors. The bedrock of this game's action RPG formula existed all the way back in
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  , one of FromSoftware's most underrated series that only gained notoriety after
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  became a major hit. Elements of
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  were adapted in
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  , with
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  serving as a spiritual successor of sorts to this PS3 exclusive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  carries over a ton of elements from the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy while having some original elements of its own. This chain of spiritual succession makes it clear that FromSoftware was well-versed with the formula when they made
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , which is just one of the many reasons why this title broke everyone's minds and became one of the greatest open-world video games ever made.

   <strong>
    Wuchang Fallen Feathers
   </strong>

  is based on the newest version of Unreal Engine 5, which breathes life into the land of Shu during the late Ming Dynasty. Even though these visuals are great, they're taking a toll on PCs as players have been experiencing performance issues with the game. From in-game stuttering to low FPS, there are a host of issues that are caused by the game's bad performance. However, this guide aims to list down the best settings that you can try in the graphics menu to optimize the game's performance.

  These were all the best settings for
  <em>
   Wuchang Fallen Feathers
  </em>
  on PC that you should use to optimize its performance. After testing the settings above on a PC with an i9-14900HX CPU, Nvidia RTX 4080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM, the performance
  <strong>
   averaged around 80-90 FPS
  </strong>
  . However, turning off DLSS and Frame Generation lowered the performance to the 55-60 FPS range, which is still an improvement over the default high-ultra settings preset.

      <title>Elden Ring Movie Reportedly in Talks With Alien Star and Fans Think They’ve Found Melina</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-movie-cailee-spaeny-melina-rumor/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Another day brings a new casting rumor attached to the anticipated
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  movie, as one insider claims a rising star from the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise may be joining the project, and fans are betting it’s for the role of Melina.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a 2022 action RPG developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco, with director Hidetaka Miyazaki and
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  writer George R.R. Martin in charge of the worldbuilding. The base game received a popular
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion in 2024 and the
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  spin-off multiplayer this year, meaning there’s no short supply of source material for the film to adapt.

 <p>
  Three years after the game’s release, production company A24 confirmed a film adaptation was in the works, with
  <em>
   Ex Machina
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Annihilation
  </em>
  director Alex Garland at the helm. Martin shared his candid opinion on the adaptation shortly after the announcement, and the writer will serve as producer to oversee the story and lore. Considering the production is already underway with casting, there’s a good chance filming could begin in 2026, potentially targeting a 2027 release date. Garland has completed work on penning
  <em>
   28 Years Later: The Bone Temple
  </em>
  and currently has no other projects in development, besides
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .

  Posted on Twitter, insider Jeff Sneider reported that Alien
  <em>
   : Romulus
  </em>
  star Cailee Spaeny was in talks to reunite with Garland in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  movie, after the two worked together on 2024’s
  <em>
   Civil War
  </em>
  . No further details were given, but fans took the news and ran with it, predicting Spaeny could potentially be playing Melina. Images of the character appeared under the report on social media, with a few accounts commenting, “I think we all know who she is playing.” Others spammed "Melina" in the comments, with an alternative choice being Ranni the Witch. Spaeny’s rumored addition joins unconfirmed whispers of
  <em>
   Heartstopper
  </em>
  star Kit Connor joining the project in a lead role, which would reunite the actor with Garland after working on this year’s
  <em>
   Warfare
  </em>
  . Additionally, the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  movie was potentially eyeing a
  <em>
   James Bond
  </em>
  star to join the ensemble in an undisclosed role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spaeny started her career voicing Rain in Behaviour Interactive’s asymmetrical horror game
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , before appearing in the television miniseries
  <em>
   Devs
  </em>
  (which was also created by Garland) and
  <em>
   Mare of Easttown
  </em>
  , as well as the movies
  <em>
   The Craft: Legacy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Priscilla
  </em>
  . Despite Bella Ramsey doing a great job evolving Ellie in HBO’s
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , fans of the Naughty Dog game series have always eyed Spaeny for the role, since the actor bears a striking resemblance to the protagonist.

 <p>
  While gamers wait for A24 to either confirm or deny Spaeny’s role,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fans have other actors in mind for Melina. The character is an important figure in the game’s lore, but rather mysterious, only appearing at Sites of Grace to assist the Tarnished on their quest to become the Elden Lord. Popular fan casts for Melina include Zoe Kravitz, who played Selina Kyle in 2022’s
  <em>
   The Batman
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  actors Nathalie Emmanuel and Rose Leslie, who played Missandei and Ygritte, respectively.

      <title>The Best War Games With Realistic Trench Combat</title>

 <p>
  Despite existing earlier and still being relevant in modern conflicts, trench warfare is synonymous with the First World War. This is also true of trench combat in video games, which, thankfully, never fully captures the true horrors of battlefields such as Verdun, Passchendaele, and the Somme.

  While some immersive games are able to accurately recreate the aesthetics of trenches, others focus on portraying the logistics, the digging, and ultimately the futility of wars of attrition down in the trenches. Across a few different genres, the following are the
  <strong>
   best games for trench warfare
  </strong>
  .

  To experience trench warfare in first person on the Western Front,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Verdun
   </em>
  </strong>
  is easily the best option, as historical accuracy and realism are at the forefront of everything. In battles from 1914 to 1918, players can expect accurate uniforms, battlegrounds, and weaponry on top of plenty of trenches. Enjoyed online with other players or offline with bots, the Frontlines game mode promises the experience of going over the top to take enemy trench lines, before defending their counterattack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game also does a good job of capturing a fraction of the gore and horror of the First World War, and when players must don gas masks, their vision will be severely limited. If players enjoy
  <em>
   Verdun
  </em>
  , then BlackMill Games have other World War 1 titles in their series, such as
  <em>
   Tannenberg
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Izonzo
  </em>
  , and the upcoming
  <em>
   Gallipoli
  </em>
  . These all explore different theaters of war and will at times include trench warfare, but not as much as
  <em>
   Verdun
  </em>
  on the Western Front.

   <em>
    Warfare 1917
   </em>
  </strong>
  was originally a browser strategy game that players may remember fondly from their childhood. However, it can now be enjoyed on Steam as part of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warfare Legacy Collection
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with the nostalgia hitting hard. In this game, players choose different troops to send into the trenches, with higher-tier units having a longer cooldown, forcing players to choose between numbers, quality, and niche requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the first trench fills up to a maximum of three units, players may send these over the top into no man's land, with the aim of capturing enemy trenches and pushing to victory. Periodically, players can also use artillery and other ranged attacks, and if the butcher's bill grows too long for either side, they could lose via a lack of morale.

  <em>
   Battlefield 1
  </em>
  is easily one of the best World War 1 games, and while many maps or campaign missions focus on more mobile parts of the war, often forgotten about, there is still plenty of trench warfare, all in realistic and gritty graphics. While the base game didn't have as many trench maps as fans wanted, more, such as Nivelle Nights, were released in DLCs, and subsequently merged into
  <em>
   Battlefield 1 Revolution
  </em>
  , which is the complete package.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other maps with trenches include St. Quentin Scar and River Somme, while there are parts of the single-player War Stories where players assault trench lines in a tank or fight their way through a trench at night after their plane crashes. While the monotony of trench warfare is not captured, the AAA graphics, sound design, and countless details make for an immersive glance into the gut-wrenching world of 1914-1918.

  , these trenches are dug and manned by real players. In this unique MMO, wars can last weeks or even months, with every last bullet, shovel, and medical supply assembled and transported by players.

 <p>
  Especially in the early stages of the war before tanks takeover, trenches are a huge part of the game and can be dug almost anywhere, in any shape or direction, and can even be upgraded to provide further protection from artillery. Barbed wire or sandbags can also line the sides of a trench if available, and players can mount machine guns in case the enemy tries to storm. Bayonets or spiked clubs can also be used in the event of hand-to-hand combat, while the injured call out for medics or a shout goes out to don gas masks.

  The Great War, as it was initially known, is often described in numbers, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    All Quiet in the Trenches
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a turn-based narrative RPG that puts individuals and their stories into the limelight. Players take on the role of a German Unteroffizier and are responsible for a group of soldiers whom they will come to know personally if they live long enough. The aim is to keep these men alive, to give them time to grieve and write home, but a superior officer will always be breathing down the player's neck, demanding more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other than strategy on the battlefield, such as turn-based trench raids, the Unteroffizier must also handle logistics to keep food, ammo, and medical supplies in good standing. Digging trenches is also part of the anti-war game, and so players will see all aspects of trench warfare, not just the actual fighting.

      <title>Magic: The Gathering Fans Have Already Found a Broken Infinite Combo with the New Marvel Cards</title>

  Fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Magic: The Gathering
   </em>
  </strong>
  have already found a broken combo in the upcoming Marvel Super Heroes set, using The Incredible Hulk to go infinite. Wizards of the Coast has gone all-in on the game's "Universes Beyond" initiative throughout the past year, releasing multiple full crossover sets in 2025. The launch of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  crossover would become
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  's most successful set ever, later launching
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  expansions throughout the year. However, 2026 looks to be a huge year for
  <em>
   Magic
  </em>
  crossovers, with a plethora of franchises on the way.

 <p>
  Wizards of the Coast has already given fans of
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  a taste of what's to come throughout 2026.
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  will launch a total of seven new Standard-legal sets during 2026, the most ever added to the format in a single year. 2026's multitude of sets will feature the return of some of
  <em>
   Magic
  </em>
  's most popular planes, with fan-favorite settings like Lorwyn and Strixhaven returning. However, Universes Beyond will make up the majority of the lineup, launching new crossover
  <em>
   Magic
  </em>
  expansions for
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel Super Heroes
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  . Now, fans may have already broken a new Incredible Hulk card.

  Magic: The Gathering Incredible Hulk Combo is OP
 </h2>
 <p>
  A brand-new Incredible Hulk card could potentially turn the
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  meta on its head, thanks to a powerful combo. The
  <em>
   Marvel Super Heroes
  </em>
  crossover will see the release of a new card for The Incredible Hulk, putting a +1/+1 counter on himself and generating additional combat phases when damaged while attacking. Fans have discovered that The Incredible Hulk has the potential to cause infinite combat phases when combined with the Caltrops artifact card, first released in 1999 in Urza's Destiny. Caltrops causes attacking creatures to take 1 damage, which can trigger Hulk's ability to generate another combat phase. The Incredible Hulk will notably never die to damage from Caltrops as well, gaining more toughness with each trigger of his ability.

 </div>
 <p>
  While The Incredible Hulk's interaction with Caltrops can potentially be game-ending, its usage will be limited. Caltrops is not currently legal in
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  's Standard or Modern formats, with its last printing coming with 7th Edition in 2001. The combo will likely be a powerhouse in the popular Commander format, however, with Bruce Banner and The Incredible Hulk able to be used as a Commander. The combo is also expected to be playable in some "eternal" 60-card formats, available in formats like Legacy and Vintage.

  Microsoft’s Game Pass service is easily worth the price of admission. Many might balk at the concept of having their video game library locked behind a subscription service, but the fact is subscribers get access to an incredible selection of titles spanning from indie darlings to triple-A blockbusters for a surprisingly affordable monthly fee.

Given that the cost of entry is taken care of with the subscription fee, the most pressing matter is determining the best use of your hard drive space. Thankfully, the diamonds of this collection are readily apparent. Here’s a look at the greatest games that Xbox Game Pass has to offer.

  The adventures of the Master Chief have never been as accessible as they are in the
  <em>
   Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  . This gathering of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  games is the definitive collection of 343 Industries’ endeavors to immortalize the series. Not only is every mainline
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  game (not counting
  <em>
   Halo 5: Guardians
  </em>
  ) included, but the fantastic
  <em>
   Halo 3: ODST
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Halo: Reach
  </em>
  were added as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  From beloved campaign co-op to thrilling Firefight matches to iconic multiplayer modes, the
  <em>
   Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  has it all. Anyone who thinks of themselves as a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  fan should consider it a must-play from Xbox Game Pass. And for those who have never completed the Master Chief’s saga, there is no better way to finish the fight.

  If you were to only see screenshots or snippets of gameplay video from
  <em>
   1000xResist
  </em>
  , you might consider yourself unimpressed. The graphics are simple, character animations are bare, and gameplay largely consists of walking your character from place to place and pressing a “talk” button. But
  <em>
   1000xResist’s
  </em>
  secret weapon is its narrative. The story of
  <em>
   1000xResist
  </em>
  alone is enough to earn it awards and keep you playing hours after you thought you might quit.

    <p>
     A small handful of games have made me tear up while playing, and
     <em>
      1000xResist
     </em>
     is one of them.

  Without spoiling overly much, you play as characters trapped in an area after a disease/alien incursion has wiped out most of humanity. A unique dialect exists between these survivors that takes some getting used to, but as the story unfolds, using a time-jumping-back-and-forth mechanic, you get used to it and the way this “society” functions. Be forewarned, this is a LOT of dialogue to listen through. But
  <em>
   1000xResist
  </em>
  is 1000 times irresistible with its narrative beats, making every word well worth it. Hekki grace.

  As a big fan of the
  <em>
   Life Is Strange
  </em>
  series and Telltale-style games in general, I was excited to play
  <em>
   Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage
  </em>
  . Made by the fantabulous Don’t Nod,
  <em>
   Bloom &amp; Rage
  </em>
  is about a group of four girls who decide to form a “riot Grrls” band in the 90s. However, as they hang out together during one fateful summer, they discover a secret in the woods that will change them forever. That’s oversimplifying the plot a lot, but you can’t expect me to divulge key narrative points for a game that is all about its narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  The special gameplay conceit of
  <em>
   Bloom &amp; Rage
  </em>
  is twofold. Main character Swann is an aspiring filmmaker, so she films everything, including collectibles you need to find. And, in addition to that, the story is gradually unfolded from both Swann’s perspective in the past and in the present. It all contributes to a retro 90s-aesthetic mystery that is sure to keep you playing through all its twists and turns.

  <em>
   Banishers
  </em>
  is exactly the kind of game you might not have heard of or you may have knowingly skipped playing in favor of an eye-grabbing, triple-A title that released around the same time. However, it should definitely be on your “to-play” list. Its story features a couple who roams the land of New Eden and spends their time giving spirits the boot from the physical world.
 </p>
 <p>
  But things take a turn for the tragic when one of them gets killed and becomes a spirit themselves. The remaining, living partner still needs to get spirit-banishing jobs done while grappling with the moral dilemma of their own loved one being stuck as a spirit until they too get “banished.”
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
  </em>
  doesn’t break any new ground when it comes to its gameplay mechanics or narrative, but both are so solidly well-done, it’s a fantastic game to seek your teeth into.

  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  is a polarizing game when you play it. You either find yourself loving it immensely or loathing it entirely. The description of an “arcade-style soccer” game can mislead you into thinking this is just casual good fun. Wrong. Your first time playing
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  , you’ll be blown away by how terribly the cars control. Your perspective as you rocket-jump your little vehicle to try and “kick” a ball into a goal will feel unhelpful. All the other players will feel like soccer gods.
 </p>
 <p>
  But once you get the hang of it,
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  provides a hilarious and surprisingly skill-based degree of fun. With practice, you too can become a soccer god. And once you reach that level of play, sure, the game can still infuriate you. But you’ll still love it when it does.

  If you adored
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  and wanted to dive into that experience again (but with more at your disposal), Obsidian Entertainment made just the game for you: its sequel. Spacer’s Choice, or should we say Auntie’s Choice, is back at it, and your custom-made Captain needs to assemble a crew and save a galaxy once again. You’ll need to navigate the political and social tangles of this new area of space, working against and alongside factions like the previously mentioned Auntie’s Choice, The Order of the Ascendant, and the Protectorate.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s all well and good; we love the Obsidian formula for RPGs. However,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds 2
  </em>
  shines the most with its sense of humor. You can find a good RPG almost anywhere, but you can’t find an RPG that combines this level of polish with a supremely fantastic sense of humor layered into every level of its systems, whether we’re talking hilarious perks/flaws or side-splitting dialogue options. If that’s your thing, you won’t be disappointed.

   The Outer Worlds 2
  </em>
  on launch? (Still playing through it, will probably add it to this list next time.) But the real joy I’ve found from the Game Pass library stems from those little games I never would have heard of or played otherwise if it hadn’t landed there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Voidtrain
  </em>
  is just one of those games. You’re venturing out into the void with nothing but a train to carry you through that empty space, so it’s your job to upgrade that train so it can withstand the enemies you’ll find in the void and provide you with resources to continue bulking it out. It’s an incredibly rewarding experience. The loop of building out your train’s capabilities and then going out to collect more resources, rinse and repeat, is one we’ve seen before. But that’s not a bad thing at all.
  <em>
   Voidtrain
  </em>
  follows a classic formula perfectly. You could say it stays “on track” with its gameplay loop.

 <p>
  Sometimes you just need a game where you’re in it for the vibes. It’s not a massive time-investment like an RPG, but it’s also not a multiple-runs, mind-engrosser like a roguelike.
  <em>
   Keeper
  </em>
  is just such a game that’s a remedy for these other titles, a palate cleanser, if you will.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a one-and-done kind of game that is meant to be experienced, enjoyed, and then fondly remembered afterward. In
  <em>
   Keeper
  </em>
  , you play as a walking lighthouse (you read that right) accompanied by a bird companion, toddling your way through a vibrant world of light platforming and puzzles. And that’s it. That’s what
  <em>
   Keeper
  </em>
  is. And it’s amazing.

  This is the best game in the world. There’s almost nothing left to say aside from that. Am I wildly biased? Perhaps. I played the first
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator
  </em>
  to the moon and back (kind of literally since I got the Wallace &amp; Gromit DLC pack), sinking over 480 hours into the game since I got it. So when I say I know my
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator
  </em>
  , I
  <strong>
   know
  </strong>
  my
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This sequel takes bits from the first game that I didn’t even think could be improved upon and improves upon them. Scaffolds now come with a ladder on the side that can take you directly to the top of the edifice. The soap system is revolutionary and satisfying instead of useless and ignorable. Your home base is not only customizable with furnishings, it’s got cats in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could, hand to whatever literary document you hold sacred, write over 50,000 words in an academic dissertation style about the nuances of
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator 2
  </em>
  . I have half a mind to, without any compensation of any kind. But alas, all I have is this entry, and hopefully that will be enough to convince you that
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator 2
  </em>
  is a game well-worth your time.

 <p>
  It’s been a long time since a game has gripped me the way
  <em>
   Ball X Pit
  </em>
  has done. (And I’m aware I’m saying this as a person who plays games on Xbox Game Pass and updates this article on a weekly basis.) It’s got the immense appeal and ease-of-entry that
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  does, but it’s more than just a clone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your characters still passively push out different kinds of abilities in the form of balls at their enemies, but there’s more control involved in
  <em>
   Ball X Pit’s
  </em>
  gameplay. You can aim where these balls will be thrown, and your upgrades can affect how a ball’s positioning increases damage done or their speed.
 </p>
 <p>
  And in addition to that, if you’re not fighting enemies during pit runs, you can build out a little base of operations, farm for resources, and upgrade buildings that will enhance your performance while battling in the pit during your downtime. I feel like I’m not doing a proper job explaining how great this game is. Just trust me when I say I think I’m enjoying this more than
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  . And I LOVE
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  .

      <title>10 Incredible Nintendo Games Turning 10 Years Old In 2026</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-incredible-nintendo-games-turning-10-years-old-anniversary-2026/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   2016
  </strong>
  was a very big year for
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  , because it was the last hurrah for the Wii U and 3DS. Software continued to be released after 2016, mostly on the 3DS, but things did slow down because of the Switch’s launch in 2017. So, did Nintendo celebrate with a big slew of unforgettable games ten years ago?
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  While there weren’t any game-changers on the level of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , there are still plenty of solid exclusive games worth remembering in 2016, and they're all
  <strong>
   turning 10 years old
  </strong>
  next year. Maybe Nintendo could help celebrate these releases with a port or remaster on the Switch 2, but let’s see how 2026 turns out first.

  It may not have been released on a Nintendo console, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, without a doubt, a huge Nintendo-related game from 2016, proving that the brand had a big reach on mobile devices. On Android or iOS, players could download the app for free and then start catching Pokemon in the real world through augmented reality.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of cultural zeitgeist, there was no game, on any console or device, bigger than
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  in 2016, and it has only continued to grow. Also, in related
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  news,
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Moon
  </em>
  were released for the 3DS that same year, and will also turn 10 in 2026.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released for the GameCube and Wii in 2006, with this HD version appearing on the Wii U in 2016. Beyond some quality of life changes like better graphics and cleaner controls, most of the core game remained untouched.
 </p>
 <p>
  This bizarre tale involves Link turning into a wolf and meeting an imp-like girl, Midna, who rides him into battle. Switch fans are still baffled that this is one Wii U game that was never ported to Nintendo's modern systems, but maybe 2026 will be the year, as this is the original game's 20th anniversary.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Kirby: Planet Robobot
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released for the 3DS, and its big gimmick was right there in the title. Kirby could still suck up enemies and fly around, but most of the gameplay took place behind the cockpit of a mech.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s one of the more action-heavy gimmicks of the
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  franchise, which was great at the time on the 3DS, a system that needed more action titles. The mech design was cool, the levels were inventive and colorful as always, and overall, it was just a positive platformer that deserves more love.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2015, first in Japan for the 3DS, before moving on to North America in 2016. It’s a notable entry for Mario’s overall RPG franchise because it combined
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  with
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  At its core, it was a
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi
  </em>
  game, but the titular paper version of Mario joined the brothers in the active turn-based battles as a third party member. While it's not the best entry in the series, it had its moments, and fans remember it most for being a weird crossover.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem Fates
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released on the 3DS in Japan in 2015 in two versions, with both games coming to North America a year later. This was a first for the
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series. In
  <em>
   Conquest
  </em>
  , players stay with their adoptive family and fight against their flesh and blood, while in
  <em>
   Birthright
  </em>
  , they stay with their natural-born family.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both tactical campaigns are incredibly different, between the missions and the characters. Later in 2016, a third DLC episode was released to tie both games together, called
  <em>
   Revelation
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball Fusions
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the more forgotten
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games, but it’s also one of the more impressive titles. Instead of being based on one of the anime arcs,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Fusions
  </em>
  featured a unique story and gameplay mechanic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can create their character and then participate in tactical battles in a 3D arena without a grid. Characters attack enemies on their own, perform combo attacks with nearby allies, or fuse with others, which creates some wild attack variety from the entire cast.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Project X Zone 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2015 on the 3DS in Japan before making its way to North America in 2016. It’s the last game in this short-lived series, but it features an incredibly wild crossover cast of characters from Sega, Capcom, and Bandai Namco games. Chrom and Lucina from
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Awakening
  </em>
  also make an appearance for Nintendo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cameos aside, the game is a grid-based tactical RPG where units can square off in combat, while players need to build combos to juggle their opponents in the air before their turn ends, which is similar to a fighting game but with a more tactical feel.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE
   </strong>
  </em>
  is another strange crossover game celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2026, and this one features a
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  -like world based in Japan, infused with entities resembling
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  characters. It was released as a Wii U exclusive in Japan in 2015, made it to North America in 2016, and there was a Switch port in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  In combat, characters can summon their
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  Personas, like Chrom or Tharja, to attack enemy weaknesses. The overall vibe is pop-heavy between the battle arenas, music, and characters trying to audition to become idols.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  fans may also remember that
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalypse
  </em>
  was released on the 3DS in 2016.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 7
  </em>
  was originally released for the PS1 in 2000 in Japan and a year later in North America. The 3DS remake,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten P
   </em>
   ast
  </strong>
  , took much longer to come west, releasing in Japan 2013 and North America in 2016, but thankfully, the latest remake,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined
  </em>
  , will ship worldwide on February 5, 2026.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ports aside, the 3DS remake was a huge improvement for the game as it made finding the tablets for time traveling less tedious. Also, enemies were now persistently visible, which negated random encounters, making the turn-based battles flow better and exploration feel fairer and less tedious.

  <em>
   Monster Hunter X
  </em>
  was the Japanese name for this 3DS entry in 2015, but the 2016 Western port renamed it to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Generations
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and the names were switched up again for the Japanese and Western releases on the Switch in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the name implies, this was sort of a best-of collection of monsters from the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series as a whole. It still followed the traditional zone-based gameplay, making it one of the more challenging entries for newcomers in the series, but one of the more beloved ones for long-time fans.

  The Salazar Slytherin Shield is a limited-time cosmetic reward tied to the Harry Potter GO Album. The shield features Salazar Slytherin himself within a pentagon-shaped golden-framed badge. It’s one of the most visually striking shields in the entire event, especially for fans of Slytherin House.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Salazar Slytherin Shield is not tied to completing any sticker album set. Instead, it is earned directly through a special event-exclusive reward:
  <strong>
   Chocolate Frog Boxes
  </strong>
  . During the Harry Potter GO season, every 1 to 6-Star Sticker Pack you open has a chance to spawn a Chocolate Frog. These frogs come in their own magical box and guarantee players a rare reward when opened.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you open a Chocolate Frog Box, you get:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   One guaranteed Famous Witch or Wizard sticker
  </li>
  <li>
   One surprise reward, which may include bonus
   <strong>
    dice rolls, exclusive emojis and shields
   </strong>
   , and even a
   <strong>
    Wild Sticker
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>

   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     The Salazar Slytherin Shield is one of the exclusive shield rewards that drop from these Chocolate Frog Boxes. Since these rewards are random, there is no direct method to target only the Slytherin Shield. You can increase your chances of getting this shield by opening as many Chocolate Frog Boxes as you can.

 <p>
  Since the Salazar Slytherin Shield is one of the special items locked behind the Chocolate Frog reward pool, you’ll need to open as many frogs as possible throughout the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best way to get more Chocolate Frog Boxes in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  is to open as many Sticker Packs as possible, since every pack has a chance for a frog to spawn. Focus on completing event milestones, tournaments, and Quick Wins to earn more packs quickly. Partner events, Wheel Boosts, and special Peg-E minigames also drop packs frequently, giving you even more opportunities to get Chocolate Frog Boxes.

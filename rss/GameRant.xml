  The Campfire is a multifunctional block in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  that was added in version 1.14. It is most often used as a decoration, but it has many other interesting functions and features that may not be immediately obvious. For example, you can use it to deal damage to mobs and other players, make smoke signals to help you not get lost in the vast
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  worlds, cook food, and even calm down bees. This guide will show you all the ways to extinguish a Campfire, which will help you unlock its full potential and surprise your friends with your knowledge of the game.

  There are three ways to put out a fire in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Water Bucket:
   </strong>
   You can extinguish the fire with waterlogging. To do this, get a water bucket and pour the water into the same block as the Campfire.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Splash Water Potion:
   </strong>
   Another way is to use the Splash Water Potion by throwing it on the fire. This is a relatively expensive method for early game, as you will need gunpowder and glass.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Shovel:
   </strong>
   And the last, cheapest, and least known way to put out a fire is with a shovel. After all, all you have to do is equip any shovel, even a wooden one, and click on the campfire with the right mouse button (or the left trigger if you are playing on a console).
  </li>

 <p>
  Now that you know how to extinguish a Campfire, you should know how to get one. Campfire can be obtained in the following ways:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Natural generation:
   </strong>
   Campfires can be found in Taiga and Snowy Taiga villages, as well as in camps in Ancient Cities. Keep in mind that in order to collect a Campfire that is already placed in the world, you will need a tool with the Silk Touch enchantment, since if you destroy it without it, you will only get two coal in the Java version and four coal in the Bedrock version.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Crafting:
   </strong>
   Campfire can be pretty easily crafted using such basic resources as sticks, wood, and charcoal (or soul sand). The last mentioned ingredient determines the type of campfire you will create â€” a regular campfire or a soul fire.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Trading:
   </strong>
   You can exchange emeralds for the campfire from the apprentice fisherman. This will cost five emeralds in the Bedrock version and two emeralds in the Java version.
  </li>
 </ul>

      <title>A Classic Fighting Game Franchise Could Be The Next Arcane If Given the Chance</title>

   <em>
    Arcane
   </em>
  </strong>
  may have only lasted two seasons, but it proved to be one of the most well-received video game adaptations yet. The series became a major success on Netflix, bringing together both hardcore
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  fans and non-gamers alike. Although the short lifespan of
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  is bittersweet, the series will hopefully serve as a blueprint for future animated game adaptations.

 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  has come to an end, it will be interesting to see which games, if any, get a similar animated treatment. There are plenty of franchises that could bring forth the same character-driven intrigue as
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  , but there is one series in particular that may be a shoo-in for the same approach.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has boasted plenty of adaptations, but getting the
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  treatment may be just what the former needs in order to finally get a worthy spin-off series.

  The
  <em>

  roster is filled to the brim with great characters. From Liu Kang and Johnny Cage to Mileena and Scorpion, some of gaming's most iconic characters are the product of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  . Even better, there is a deep well of lore for writers to pull from if a fresh animated
  <em>

  </em>
  series ever comes to fruition. The intertwining stories of these characters present the perfect stage for drama and twists, but unfortunately,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat

  This is a significant number of adaptations, but unfortunately, they have mostly either faced mixed or negative reviews. While some of the animated films have received better feedback than their live-action counterparts, a streaming series may be a better path for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  to take.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a series like
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  , it's easier to dive deeper into character dynamics and their backstories, while movies only allow for a short amount of time. For a series as character-focused as
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  , multi-episode seasons could finally give the fighting franchise the gripping adaptation it deserves. Even more important, though, a
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  spin-off is in need of the right team behind it.

  The Team Behind Arcane Was the Secret Ingredient Mortal Kombat Needs

 <p>
  Series creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee worked alongside French animation studio Fortiche in order to bring
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  to life. While a hypothetical
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  series may not be able to secure the same team, since the franchise is under Warner Bros. ownership and not affiliated with Netflix, producers and animators with a similar vision could potentially make an adaptation that is just as special.
 </p>
 <p>
  With rumors suggesting that
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  may be nearing its end sooner than expected, it's unclear what the franchise's next move might be. The next movie is slated for the latter half of the year, but beyond that, it's a mystery.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has a lot of potential to put forth an emotionally driven series or film, but it has struggled to hit the notes that
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  excelled at.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  may never get a similar animated series, but it has nearly all the ingredients needed to be a worthy

      <title>One Dead by Daylight Feature is Missing an Obvious Addition</title>

 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead by Daylight
   </strong>
  </em>
  's newest features already has an ominous omission that can hopefully be corrected in the future.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  has seen a lot of new ideas throughout 2024; with a few new chapters introducing new Survivors and Killers, as well as a few limited-time modes coming and going, the developers have shown plenty of innovation over the past year. Despite all of this though, there is one obvious idea that has evaded the game completely.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  The amount of outfits in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  that players can unlock for Survivors and Killers alike is a key aspect of the game. The ability to add a personal touch to characters with cosmetics both earned and bought has been a boon for players throughout the game's lifespan. This also extends to the charms that players can equip to their Survivor's belt or Killer's hooks. Aside from occasional changes in visibility, these cosmetics have no real effect on
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's gameplay. That said, it's hard to imagine the game at this point without a variety of ways to dress up its characters.

 <h3 id="badges-and-banners-let-dead-by-daylight-players-customize-their-profiles">
  Badges and Banners Let Dead by Daylight Players Customize Their Profiles
 </h3>
 <p>
  Badges and banners were introduced alongside Chucky's debut in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  as an additional way for players to accessorize. Badges and banners act as profile pictures and wallpapers, respectively, and appear on the player's own lobby as well as the results screen after each game. Most badges come as rewards, being earned through either rifts or events. However, there are a few that players have been able to get from codes in the shop as well. While ultimately a small flourish, badges and banners are certainly a welcome addition. At the same time, they're missing the mark in one admittedly obvious way.
 </p>
 <h3 id="dead-by-daylight-is-missing-badges-for-its-characters">
  Dead by Daylight is Missing Badges For its Characters
 </h3>
 <p>
  With a few exceptions, there are no badges for
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Killers and Survivors as of yet. This seems like an odd decision even on its surface. When one thinks of ways that players might want to represent themselves in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , the game's own characters are one of the first ideas that would come to mind. Events have led to a few additions, such as Yun-Jin and Trickster badges based on their unlockable cosmetics from the latest Halloween event. Still, the fact that there aren't commonly available cosmetics for the game's playable cast makes it feel like there's something missing.
 </p>
 <h3 id="dbd-has-multiple-ways-to-make-character-badges-available">
  DbD Has Multiple Ways to Make Character Badges Available
 </h3>
 <p>
  For a small amount of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Iridescent Shards, character badges could be made buyable in the shop. A second option would be to make them unlockable through the prestige system, similar to the prestige cosmetics and perk charms already available. If this method was taken, then it would have the additional perk of showing that players with said badge have put a significant amount of effort into leveling up said character. Either way, giving players the opportunity to represent themselves with their favorite character should be possible in-game.

     There's potential for some characters to have themed banners as well, like a graffiti mural for Nea or animal masks for Huntress.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's own playable characters are the best unused inspiration for badges in the game. Hopefully, it won't be too far into
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's future for such badges to make their way into the game. After all, while a lot of the current badges are interesting and have great aesthetics, it doesn't feel right to not have the game's own cast represented as
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's Survivors and Killers are more than deserving of their own badges in-game.

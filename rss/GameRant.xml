      <title>Pokemon Legends: Z-A Needs to Spill the Beans on One Gen 6 Character's Lore</title>

 <p>
  Though the greatly-anticipated
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  is likely to be set for release a little later in 2025, fans of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series have been able to fill the unusually long gap between releases with theorycrafting and speculation regarding the next major title in the series. With very little official knowledge of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  just yet, anything from the upcoming title's precise setting to its potential connections to other games has become a frequent point of discussion. Adding to the speculation is the possibility of
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  expanding on the lore of - or potentially even seeing the return of - one fan-favorite Gen 6 character - Zinnia.

 <p>
  For a few reasons, Gen 6
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games certainly stood out as some particularly controversial installments of the franchise when they launched more than a decade ago. A departure from the classic 2D sprites and a shift in art style marked a new beginning for the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series on the 3DS, but nowadays, the Gen 6 games themselves are typically remembered fondly by fans thanks to the introduction of Mega Evolution and the extremely well-regarded remakes of the original Gen 3 games,
  <em>
   Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby
  </em>
  . It was in these Hoenn remakes that Zinnia made her first and so far only appearance in the core-series games, becoming a community-favorite character despite only appearing relatively briefly in the games' post-story Delta episode.

 <p>
  Despite not playing any key role in the main story of the Gen 3
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  remakes, Zinnia is a crucial ally to the player during the Delta episode, helping them meet the legendary Rayquaza in order to prevent a catastrophic meteor impact with the Hoenn region. It's not by chance that Zinnia carries such in-depth knowledge of the Hoenn region's legends - she's a lorekeeper of the Draconid people, an ancient clan of Dragon tamers who inhabited the Hoenn region and worshiped Rayquaza. She's a considerably developed character considering her comparatively brief appearance in the franchise, steeped in a somewhat mysterious past that's scarcely discussed in the games at all.

 <p>
  For example, it's known that Zinnia had a close friend or potentially even romantic partner by the name of Aster, who is heavily implied to have died at some point in the past. Zinnia is seen wearing Aster's cloak throughout the game as a sort of memento and even named her Whismur after them. While a little more detail regarding Aster and Zinnia's history is held in the
  <em>
   Pokemon Adventures
  </em>
  manga, this is known to be separate from the games' narrative continuity, and thus many fans have hoped to see Zinnia return in another core-series
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  title, perhaps providing room for her story and character to be properly expanded on.

 <p>
  It's unlikely that Zinnia will actually make any sort of appearance in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  . While the upcoming title is indeed set to take players back to Gen 6's Kalos region, and
  <em>
   Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby
  </em>
  were Gen 6 titles themselves, there's not much linking the Kalos and Hoenn regions besides the lore surrounding Mega Evolution. Perhaps more importantly, Zinnia herself looks to be in her twenties at the oldest, and while it's not technically known for sure yet,
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will likely take place in the Kalos region's past or future. With all that said, though, there is one plausible way that Zinnia could directly appear in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Again, it's not particularly likely for Zinnia to make an appearance in
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , but it is possible thanks to one recurring and prominent mechanic within the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  multiverse - timeline travel. This is not to be confused with time travel, as timeline travel involves the transportation of Pokemon or characters between alternate universes rather than between different points in time within the same universe. The existence and interaction of different realities has been a key underlying aspect of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  world's deeper lore for most of the franchise's life, with timeline travel most recently being a key plot point in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  's story as it explains the origins of the Paradox Pokemon.

 <p>
  Such timeline travelers have been identified throughout the games for years, with players able to find Looker of the International Police washed up on the Battle Resort in
  <em>
   Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby
  </em>
  in a way that suggests he was recently transported from another universe. Similarly,
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun and Moon
  </em>
  's post-game story features Anabel, originally a Frontier Brain from an alternate Hoenn who became a member of the International Police after being transported to a different universe. Perhaps most notable are Ingo and the protagonist in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , though they could be legitimate time travelers considering the involvement of Arceus in their case.

 <p>
  Regardless, it would make sense for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's story to feature some timeline travelers of its own, and Zinnia would make for a possible and interesting candidate. Not only does she carry a Key Stone, which would allow her to battle with Mega Evolution in a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game that will bring this phenomenon back for the first time in over 6 years, but she also proves in
  <em>

  While this possibility definitely provides some food for thought, it's more likely that
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will expand not on Zinnia's character, but rather the clan she comes from - the Draconids. While these Dragon masters are technically only known to have inhabited the Hoenn region, it is established in
  <em>
   Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby
  </em>
  that the clan had met AZ, the immortal king of the Kalos region, when he visited the region 1,000 years ago and witnessed a battle between Rayquaza and the super-ancient Pokemon. It's quite likely that AZ will appear and play a major role in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , and much of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  world's ancient history could be learned from him - including information regarding the Draconid clan.

   <em>
    The War Within
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the tenth expansion in
  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Each expansion has a wealth of new content that builds on prior additions and features. These additions may be wholly new systems, such as the recent Warbands or Hero Talents, or further iterations of previous systems. One of the biggest content additions to each expansion is the dungeons.

 <p>
  Dungeons in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  are five-player, PvE instances that see players adventure through a location and kill enemies and bosses to obtain loot, be it gear, transmog, pets, or mounts. These dungeons come in a series of increasing difficulties, each offering better rewards than the last.
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  added eight dungeons, all of which are solid additions to the extensive roster of dungeons in the game. Despite all of them being polished and well-made, others fall short when compared to their counterparts, and some stand out as impressive and compelling designs, be they aesthetically or mechanically.

  The Stonevault is a dungeon in the Ringing Deeps that houses four bosses. These are E.D.N.A., Skarmorak, The Master Machinists, and Void Speaker Eirich. The dungeon is set in a large mechanized underground facility, not unlike that of the Titan Facilities. Players are ultimately tasked with defeating Void Speaker Eirich, who aims to further increase the power of his newfound void infusion that has driven him to the brink of insanity.

 <p>
  The Stonevault is a solid dungeon, although one that is potentially too safe and plain when compared to the other dungeons in the expansion. None of the boss encounters are massively memorable and the setting, while interesting, provides a rather standard aesthetic to the dungeon that many players find lacking. When compared to other
  <em>
   War Within
  </em>
  dungeons, the Stonevault simply lacks a lot of the artistic flair that others have in spades.

  The City of Threads is a four-boss dungeon located in Azj-Kahet. The bosses found within are Orator Krix'vizk, The Fangs of the Queen, The Coaglamation, and Izo, the Grand Splicer. The dungeon is set deep within the City of Threads within a Nerubian facility that is being used to forcefully evolve Nerubians into the peak of their power, wherein "worthy" Nerubians shall "ascend." Players are tasked by the Weaver and the Vizier to put a stop to this.

 <p>
  The setting of City of Threads is incredible and immersive. The City of Threads itself looks incredible and has an inspired, unique design that continues the oft-praised design of Azj-Kahet as a whole. The main thing that turns away many players from City of Threads is the first boss, which requires players to find multiple smaller bosses while avoiding getting caught, lest they be teleported back to the start. This, while a thematically coherent mechanic, given the stealthy qualities of the Weaver and the players' antics in Azj-Kahet, slows down the pace of the dungeon massively. This is especially prevalent when compared to a lot of the other dungeons in
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  that allow players to move through them at a relatively quick pace.

  The Rookery is a three-boss dungeon located on the Isle of Dorn within the capital city and hub city of the expansion, Dornogal. The Rookery, as the name suggests, is the home of the Stormrooks and their riders, the Stormriders. The Rookery and its inhabitants have been overrun and corrupted by void magic, so players must enter and defeat the bosses within to cleanse the Rookery of the void. The bosses found inside are Kryos, Stormguard Gorren, and The Voidstone Monstrosity.

  The Rookery is a solid entry to the dungeon pool, with a unique level of verticality as the dungeon technically takes place at five different levels of elevation. The placement of the first boss is odd, sitting rather randomly out in the open, but subsequent bosses are good, and the dungeon is well laid out and has a good setting. Its position in the rankings merely reflects the quality of other
  <em>
   War Within
  </em>
  dungeons and their theming and design, which allow them to take a position above The Rookery.

  Darkflame Cleft is a four-boss dungeon located in the Ringing Deeps. Once an active mine, inhabited by the earthen machine speakers, Darkflame Cleft has since fallen into disrepair under the occupation of the tyrannical kobold Candle King and his men. Players must liberate the oppressed workers and kobolds under the influence of the Candle King, ultimately defeating their greatest fear, an entity known as The Darkness. The four bosses found within Darkflame Cleft are Ol'Waxbeard, Blazikon, The Candle King, and The Darkness.

 <p>
  Darkflame Cleft is a unique adventure through an abandoned mine, providing an unsettling but very kobold-heavy experience that fleshes out the kobolds found within the area. The most unique element comes in the fight with The Darkness, in which players must first navigate the dark via candlelight, ensuring they aren't consumed by the shadows. At the end of that segment, players can damage The Darkness boss in a literal on-rails minecart chase that sees players hurling dynamite at the boss. Finally, players fight and defeat The Darkness in a normal boss encounter. These unique mechanics and interesting framing of the final boss encounter ensure players have a memorable dungeon experience. Some players have criticized the nature of the shadows section, bringing the position of Darkflame Cleft into contention with regard to the rankings.

  Ara-Kara, City of Echoes is a three-boss dungeon located in Azj-Kahet. The three bosses found inside are Avanoxx, Anub'zekt, and Ki'katal The Harvester. The dungeon is another with Nerubian theming and setting, lying beneath the City of Threads. Players must venture within Ara-Kara to stop a plot in which Ansurek would forcefully "ascend" all Nerubians.

  Ara-Kara, City of Echoes is an incredibly well-designed dungeon. It merges an almost old god aesthetic (given its position as an old god dig site) with that of the spider-like Nerubians found within Azj-Kahet and the City of Threads. This aesthetic matches the surrounding zone perfectly and arguably handles the Nerubian designs better than City of Threads does, not to mention it being a more straightforward but inspired dungeon structure.

  The Dawnbreaker is a three-boss dungeon located in the Hallowfall zone. The three bosses players will encounter are Speaker Shadowcrown, Anub'ikkaj, and Rasha'nan. The dungeon is centered around the defense of the new Arathi warship, the Dawnbreaker. Under the pretense of witnessing the maiden voyage of the Dawnbreaker, players are welcomed aboard, only to end up having to defend the ship from encroachers.

 <p>
  The Dawnbreaker is the only dungeon in War Within that utilizes skyriding mechanics. While divisive, as when utilized in
  <em>
   Dragonflight
  </em>
  , many players find the use of the skyriding mechanics logical and engaging. Players find themselves taking flight to avoid attacks and bouncing ship-to-ship atop the skyriding mount of their choice. The airship setting evokes memories of Icecrown Citadel and this setting, coupled with the flow of the dungeon and skyriding features, allows for a unique and compelling dungeon experience.

  Cinderbrew Meadery is a four-boss dungeon located on the Isle of Dorn. The bosses players will encounter are Brew Master Aldyr, Benk Buzzbee, I'pa, and Goldie Baronbottom. The meadery is where earthen mead is produced, although it has since undergone a hostile takeover at the hands of the goblin entrepreneur, Goldie Baronbottom. Players must return the meadery to the hands of the earthen.

  Cinderbrew Meadery is an incredible setting, immersing players in a more lighthearted setting while contributing to slice-of-life development opportunities for the earthens, the newest allied race. The bee theme, alongside the well-designed interior, gives a warm and cozy feel to the setting. The dungeon design is solid and the bosses are engaging and fun.

  Priory of the Sacred Flame is a three-boss dungeon located in Hallowfall, specifically at a high point in the city of Mereldar. The priory is home to rather frenetic religious zealots, looking down on the people of Mereldar for their perceived lack of faith. This has driven the inhabitants of the priory to isolate themselves with their sense of superiority. The three bosses players will encounter within the Priory of the Sacred Flame are Sergeant Shaynemail, Taenear Duelmal, and Elaena Emberlanz.

 <p>
  The priory itself is grand in scale, and a true gorgeous sight to behold, with bright holy lights and tall ceilings creating a true sense of superiority. The interior is adorned with gold and red, perfectly adhering to the grandiose iconography of the Arathi in Hallowfall, also seen within the plate set that can be obtained from the zone. The dungeon also has a unique final encounter, as players ascend stairs and are ambushed by waves of zealots as they fight the final boss, further adding to the feel of how dedicated those within the priory are, throwing themselves into battle. Overall, Priory Of The Sacred Flame is a well-made dungeon, which is a good length, has solid boss encounters, and is incredibly visually appealing.

  Friday, September 6 is going to be a day of mixed emotions for the
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  brand, as that day will see the launch of the critically-acclaimed
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  as well as the demise of the recently-released hero-shooter
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  . PlayStation is a leading players in the console gaming market, with over 61 million PS5 consoles sold to date.

 <p>
  New games are released for the PS5 on a near-constant basis, which is a big part of the reason why the console's sales are so high. There are plenty of third-parties releasing games for the PS5, including some console exclusives, but Sony itself is also making its own games. One of the most critically-acclaimed PlayStation games will be released on September 6, but its release date coincides with the shutdown of one of the company's biggest failures.

  September 6 is the day that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  releases to the masses, and it's also the day that
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  will be shut down indefinitely.
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  has earned rave reviews from critics and is currently the highest-rated new video game release of 2024 with an astonishing 95 overall rating.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , meanwhile, was released to mixed reviews from critics and was rejected by the community. It reportedly sold a mere 25,000 copies or so and struggled to find a player base. The complete lack of interest in
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  has led to Sony making the unprecedented decision to shut the game down just two weeks after its launch.

  While it's true that the vast majority of PlayStation gamers didn't care about
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , it's still sad to see a first-party game fall on its face. Sony will no doubt be taking a financial hit because of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's failures, and it's unclear if a potential re-launch as a free-to-play game down the road can save it.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  has been a failure for Sony, but the good news is that the same day it's being shut down is the day that the company is releasing one of the year's most critically-acclaimed games.

 <p>
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, and hopefully, that enthusiasm will translate to strong sales. It may also send a message to Sony about what consumers want from the brand. One of the reasons why
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  was skipped by many PlayStation fans is that they want single-player games from the studio, not live-services. It will be interesting to see how
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  performs commercially, and if
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  ever makes a return.

    Content Warning

  </strong>
  takes the players into the midst of a thrilling world, where they bravely record the frightening monsters lurking in the dark and post their spine-chilling experience on Spooktube to gather views. In this circle of fear and suspense, garnering views depends on many things, including the player’s choice of face.

  Fortunately, customization in the virtual world of

  is limitless as one gets to choose from a variety of faces with their own personality and humor. From mischievous grins to surprised expressions, these faces are easily customizable within the game, allowing players to represent their unique persona.

   The face can make all the difference in the videos you record for Spooktube in Content Warning. Thankfully, Content Warning offers players endless customization options, allowing them to create all kinds of different faces with unique personalities and humor. Even though the options are limitless, some faces are just more popular than others. We’ve updated this guide with three more faces that will help players stand out from the crowd.

  The Doubtful Face is simply skeptical and uncertain, notably in its eyes—one wide open, the other narrow, giving a vibe of being intrigued or distrusting. When a character appears in videos with this face, it makes the viewers more curious.

 <p>
  The O_o face adds confusion and draws the spectators into the character's way of skepticism and discovery. Whether it is about unusual creatures or strange places in the video game, this face will appear to the viewers as the one who treats all of these creatures and places with suspicion.

  The face can show a lot of things, from frustration to impatience and irritation, but the most obvious emotion it displays is that of annoyance. Players can use the Annoyed Face in lots of different situations to show discontent and disapproval.

 <p>
  For example, -_- is the perfect expression when one is being faced by annoying obstacles, frustrating challenges, or just simply unfair creatures. Every time a video features a character with an Annoyed Face, viewers get hooked and can sort of relate to the character in their frustrations.

  The Disappointed Face makes you look frustrated throughout. Viewers can feel the disappointment from the downturned mouth and closed eyes, revealing the agony of the character. The Use of the Disappointed Face in the
  <em>
   Content Warning
  </em>
  videos adds a different feel.

 <p>
  The small inverted _w_ enhances the impression of disappointment. Whether a monster is beating up the character hard or they are struggling through the game, the face helps spectators to connect with players.

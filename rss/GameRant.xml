  , despite being extremely similar to its predecessor in terms of presentation and gameplay, paved the way for a number of key changes to the overarching narrative of the franchise. These changes followed the more foundational shifts that came alongside the series' reboot in 2018, which thrust Kratos into the world of Norse mythology, allowing
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  to experiment with new mythical characters, settings, and concepts.

  Many expect the series to move on from its current Nordic setting, adopting a sort of anthology format and visiting other mythological backdrops. This could very well be the case, as Atreus is setting off on his own journey, which could take him to any number of strange lands. Moreover, the ending of
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  was devastating for the Norse pantheon, as players saw the deaths of key figures like Odin, Heimdall, and Thor. That said, the legacy of at least one of these characters may live on, as there are characters that can memorialize him and grant players an alternate perspective, even in death.

  Thor May Live On Through Thrud in the Next God of War

 <p>
  Although Thor seems to be out of the picture, his daughter most certainly isn't. At the end of
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  , Thrud can be seen searching for Mjolnir, Thor's mythical hammer that was cast into the abyss by Odin during their final battle. While exploring the open-world during the endgame, players can come across Thrud in Alfheim, where she appears to have found the magical weapon. She lifts it without difficulty and soars into the sky, an image that suggests her ascent into a powerful warrior, possibly a Valkyrie, wielding her late father's hammer.

 <p>
  With Thrud's newfound power, she may choose to join Atreus on his journey to seek out the remaining Giants. This would be fitting as, along with Angrboda, the three youngsters could form their own collective legacy, seeking adventure, glory, and purpose outside the confines of their ancestry. As Thor's daughter, Thrud is in an interesting position to provide a unique perspective, perhaps likening or contrasting her own experience as the child of a god with Atreus'.

 <p>
  Through this examination of godhood, players could very well see Thor again, whether it be through flashbacks, visions, or spiritual encounters. Although the Norse games have seemingly pivoted away from this trope, death is not always permanent in
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , with Kratos himself dying multiple times over the course of the series, only to claw his way back to life in some way or other. While a full resurrection of Thor seems unlikely, and would be potentially underwhelming to boot, it wouldn't be totally implausible for Thrud to visit her father through some sort of magical means.

 <p>
  According to Norse mythology, Thor should currently be in Valhalla, as he died during battle. There are numerous benefits to visiting Valhalla in a future
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  title, one of which being the possibility of seeing Thor again. Thrud could get closure, and players could perhaps see a different, more sensitive side of the god, which was glimpsed only briefly before he was slain by his father.

     Thor's death is a bit of a gray area and may not technically be considered Valhalla-worthy, as he was caught off guard and wasn't technically in the midst of a fight. In this case, Thor would be in Helheim.

  It seems like

  won't be leaving the Norse era behind completely, as Kratos and other key characters are seemingly inextricable from it.

      <title>Upcoming Free-To-Play Games People Are Excited For</title>

  Gaming is expensive. Whether someone prefers consoles or PC, they will need to invest a fair amount of cash just to set up their stations. Once the hardware is ready to go, owners will need to turn to their platform's libraries to pick up some software. Nowadays, Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus grant access to massive selections of games for monthly fees; however, most AAA titles do not debut on these subscription services. Consequently, players could find themselves regularly dropping $69.99 to experience the latest exciting projects.

   Free-to-play games

  <strong>
   new free games

   July 2024 will go down as one of the biggest months for free games ever. Zenless Zone Zero, The First Descendant, and Once Human all had successful launches, garnering healthy player bases and quite a bit of praise. They were not all equal – The First Descendant attracted way more criticism than the other two – but they all seem to have found places in the wider gaming climate. Another month like July is unlikely to happen anytime soon, but there are plenty of exciting

 <p>
  With early access set to launch in July 2024,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  should be a very big deal, especially since its predecessor is still a popular MOBA. However, the reaction to the game's announcement was somewhat muted, with the tone being almost defined by confusion rather than excitement. That's not to say Titan Forge and Hi-Rez's sequel looks bad, as it seems to be an evolution of the original
  <em>
   Smite
  </em>
  that comes with a notable graphical upgrade thanks to the use of Unreal Engine 5. When it debuts,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  should be among the genre's most accessible representatives, and a fresh start might help attract newcomers who feel too intimidated to jump into the 10-year-old original game.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  does not seem to be all that different from its predecessor. Going on the currently available information, the upgrade appears to be more in line with
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  's improvements instead of a traditional sequel. Hi-Rez has confirmed that the first game will not be shutting down to coincide with its successor's debut, a decision that might discourage fans from swapping products. At the same time, one has to assume the clock is ticking on
  <em>
   Smite
  </em>
  's life.

  Anyone into MMORPGs has likely heard of NCSoft. The company and its subsidiaries are responsible for
  <em>
   Guild Wars 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Blade &amp; Soul
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lineage
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   WildStar
  </em>
  ; sure, not all those projects can be classified as roaring successes, but they nevertheless showcase the developer's expertise.
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  is shaping up to be among NCSoft's most ambitious projects to date, especially since the MMORPG has been in development for more than a decade by this point.

  </em>
  should include traditional quests, a weather system, and a mechanic that permits players to transform into animals. Beyond that, the title focuses on guild-based conflicts, with players trying to spread their chosen group's influence across the nation. Marketed as PvPvE,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  looks set to target quite a wide range of gameplay styles; hopefully, it proves to be successful.

  Coming to PC and consoles,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  brings together some of the most famous comic characters and throws them into an
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  -style game, with matches pitting two teams of six against each other. Heroes like Spider-Man, Black Panther, Iron Man, and Hulk have been confirmed, and there will even be a couple of villains (or anti-heroes) like Venom, Loki, and Magneto.

 <p>
  All-in-all, the confirmed roster is impressive and covers a reasonable range of properties, even if most of the inclusions are mainstream (except for Magik and Peni Parker, both of which are surprising picks). From the footage shown so far and the beta impressions,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' gameplay should be hectic, fast-paced, and fun, with the characters' unique abilities seemingly shining through.

  While still popular, battle royales do kind of feel like a thing of the past. At this point, the genre is dominated by a couple of evergreen releases, and any new names seem to struggle to make a dent when they must compete against established names like
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Many developers have tried to leave their mark by going big, but maybe they should have opted to move in the opposite direction.
  <em>
   Mini Royale
  </em>
  drops 50 toy soldiers into a child's messy room and challenges them to survive. While the gameplay does not seem too far removed from the status quo, Indigoblue's game stands out due to its whimsical premise and charming map, at least going by the one that has been shown off so far.

 <p>
  If done right,
  <em>
   Mini Royale
  </em>
  could come as a breath of fresh air in a somewhat stagnant genre. The premise should pave the way for a unique range of weapons and items that go beyond the traditional armories found in most battle royales. Beyond that, the developer has confirmed that the map will have small touches that take advantage of the core concept, including a toy train as a means of travel.

  Launching a beta period in May 2024,
  <em>
   Arena Breakout: Infinite
  </em>
  has been gathering steam in recent weeks, hopefully paving the way for a successful full debut in the future. An extraction shooter that shares similarities with projects like
  <em>
   Escape from Tarkov
  </em>
  , the game aims for realism in its presentation, weapon customization, and gun feedback, which tends to be the case with these sorts of titles.

 <p>
  The beta version shows promise, particularly in its visuals, quality-of-life ideas, and weapon options; however, the game is fairly rough around the edges in places and does not seem to contain too many new ideas. However, betas are specifically designed to promote player feedback, so
  <em>
   Arena Breakout
  </em>
  could and should improve in the coming months.

  Set to be published by Amazon Games,
  <em>
   Blue Protocol
  </em>
  is an anime-style JRPG with real-time combat and a weapon-based class system. Announced at the 2022 Game Awards, Bandai Namco's project promises to offer customization, a large world to explore, multiplayer gameplay, and a detailed storyline.

  So far,
  <em>
   Blue Protocol
  </em>
  has showcased beautiful visuals, fun hack and slash combat, and a good amount of variety via its five classes. As an MMORPG, the game includes dungeons that players will be able to take on either solo or with a team. With titles like
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  under its belt, Bandai Namco definitely knows how to piece together a fun action RPG.

  While Ubisoft canceled
  <em>
   Heartland
  </em>
  , a free-to-play
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  game that was fairly hyped up for a while, the publisher seems set to release a mobile game set in the same universe.
  <em>
   Resurgence
  </em>
  looks to adapt the franchise's MMO structure for Android and iOS devices, delivering similar third-person shooter gunplay, missions, exploration, and loot. Returning to New York, the setting for the first game in the series, the
  <strong>
   upcoming free game
  </strong>
  will also feature an open-world that supports both PvE and PvP content, with the latter coming courtesy of the Dark Zone. The former will include a brand-new campaign and storyline that focuses on the early days of the virus' spread, casting players as early members of the Strategic Homeland Division.

  Going on the beta footage released so far,
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's The Division: Resurgence
  </em>
  looks pretty promising, especially for a mobile device. While the pre-release gameplay shows some stutter, that could be ironed out by the time the final product launches; even then, the game still looks good in its current state.
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  has kind of a weird reputation. Despite not being as talked about as some other live-service projects like
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , the franchise has been largely successful, and
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  is still quite active.

  Embark is really knocking things out of the park when it comes to
  <strong>
   upcoming free games
  </strong>
  . Naturally, it remains to be seen whether these projects live up to the hype, but
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  has already proven it has more to offer than just empty promises.
  <em>
   Arc Raiders

  appears to be a bit further away from completion than the developer's other project, although the game has had a fairly successful closed beta.

  Extraction shooters are an acquired taste, and the subgenre is very niche compared to other types of multiplayer games on the market. Still, titles like
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Deep Rock: Galactic
  </em>
  demonstrate its potential, and
  <em>
   ARC Raiders
  </em>
  ' free-to-play nature might attract a new audience that has largely ignored these projects.

  Grinding Gear's
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  enjoyed its 10-year anniversary in 2023, and the game is still among the best free-to-play options on the market. Presented as an alternative to
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , the isometric action RPG delivers stellar customization, gameplay, and a lot of content that can be enjoyed without requiring any cash investment.
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  prides itself on not being pay-to-win, and the developer has generally stuck to that commitment. Now, the sequel is on the horizon, and it is shaping up to be an exciting expansion of an already beloved hack and slash dungeon crawler.

  Generally, when an upcoming free project vows to deliver the stars and moon, skepticism should be the natural reaction; however, Grinding Gear's words are backed by years of generally good work. Therefore, when
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  's Steam description promotes a six-act campaign and extensive endgame content in the form of 100+ maps with unique boss fights, there is a chance that the final product might actually deliver on these promises. The sequel will also feature 12 base classes, 36 Ascendancy classes, a skill gem system, and hundreds of unique equipment.

  Debuting in 2019 on mobile devices,
  <em>
   Arknights
  </em>
  is nowadays well established as one of the industry's most famous projects. It was even successful enough to warrant an anime adaptation, and the franchise looks set to continue its expansion with a spin-off game set on a new planet. Endfield Industries has taken measures to bring civilization to Talos-II, but the world and its locals have been less than welcoming. Set following a disaster that greatly hurt this movement, players step into the shoes of PFRD operatives tasked with taming the alien planet.

 <p>
  <em>
   Arknights: Endfield
  </em>
  looks set to be fairly different from the mainline entry. For one, the spin-off will utilize real-time strategy combat, although exact details on the system's mechanics have yet to be provided. It is also unclear whether the game will employ gacha mechanics, although that seems likely. More importantly,
  <em>
   Endfield
  </em>
  will be available on PC, an ecosystem that
  <em>
   Arknights
  </em>
  has yet to target specifically.

  An Eastern MMORPG that completed an Exploratory Closed Beta Test in June 2023,
  <em>
   Perfect New World
  </em>
  has a ways to go before reaching completion, but Ironcore is working on implementing a wide range of changes inspired by user feedback. Cast as Soul Tamers, players will strive to find Prime, a journey that involves exploring a seemingly fairly attractive fantasy world filled with dungeons, enemies, and NPCs. Obviously, the MMORPG will support co-op/multiplayer, and PvP is also part of the overall experience and is being tweaked following the closed beta.

  <em>

  's combat system seems to lean into real-time hack and slash territory, with fast-paced action being the name of the game. As with most MMORPGs, players will be able to pick from a range of classes that come with their own skill trees. Although there is nothing too unique about these ideas, they could combine to create a fun addition to the free-to-play market.

  Dani has two successful free games under their belt:
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Crab Game
  </em>
  . Both titles focus on physics-based gameplay, and they are fairly impressive considering they largely stemmed from the mind of a single person. Dani's next project is
  <em>
   Karlson
  </em>
  , a first-person shooter that heavily incorporates parkour and speed-running. The eponymous character is a prisoner who must wall-jump and blast their way through a series of levels en route to a glass of milk.

  The creator's resume and social media presence ensure

  The tactical RPG
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes everything there is to love about a JRPG and adds another dimension to it. Players will have access to parties that utilize a wide range of skills and abilities, but these abilities will not be effective unless players can set up these characters in the correct positions on a map.

  Having these games on a Nintendo Switch

  Fans of
  <em>
   Advanced Wars
  </em>
  should immediately look into
  <em>
   Wargroove
  </em>
  and its sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wargroove 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Having
  <em>
   Wargroove 2
  </em>
  is no excuse to not play the first game. Both are amazing, and the second can be played immediately after the first one. Both games will have players commanding various squads on a map, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

 <p>
  <em>
   Wargroove
  </em>
  had a wide range of incredibly powerful units, and its sequel brings them all back to enjoy. Knowing what will be superior against enemy squads and positioning will be the keys to victory. There are also plenty of terrain buffs to make use of, as having a defensive advantage over an opponent can be a quick way to gain the upper hand.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the follow-up title to the highly successful
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle
  </em>
  — with
  <em>
   Kingdom Battle
  </em>
  being one of the best-selling Switch titles that was not published by Nintendo.
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  keeps many of the elements of what made the first one so great and improves on many others — especially with the overworld feeling far more engaging.

 <p>
  Each of the characters is fun, and team actions add a level of engagement rarely seen in turn-based squad options. The game is weird, wacky, and just an utter delight to look at while playing, and when this is coupled with its fun gameplay, it's a title that is hard to put down from start to finish.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Disgaea
  </em>
  franchise is known for its over-the-top humor and wildly surreal world settings. Each game has a different story with different characters, but past games are referenced in follow-up titles. The games also have a blend of fantasy, sci-fi, and commonly used anime tropes. Players will enjoy many familiar tactical RPG elements such as commanding various units, but also some unique elements. One of which is known as the Dark Assembly, a way in which players can pass bills in the game that can completely alter the game’s rules.

  One of the features that players will quickly want to master is Geo Effects. Players will find cells that will be blinking a certain color, as well as special blocks that state they grant an effect to all cells that match the color of the one it is on. This can allow players to stack the odds in their favor by stacking these blocks on a single color or destroying a block to cause all the matching cells to change to the color of the block and damage any enemies in the process.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Into the Breach
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the best tactical indie game titles around, and will match giant mechs against giant monsters to duke it out on small grid maps. These maps will have different terrains depending on the island players deploy to. Just like the
  <em>
   X-COM
  </em>
  games, players will be able to select from various missions, with more challenging ones offering better rewards. Once ready, they will send out three of their mech units, which are made even better with a pilot.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":958} -->

 <p>
  The mechs featured in the game will each come with a Special, which can act in tandem with each pilot's Special. This can allow for a pilot that gives its mech a shield at the start of the mission, with a mech that can take two actions instead of moving — a great blend of both offense and defense.

  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  is a long-running franchise that has amassed a loyal fanbase over its many amazing titles.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Three Houses
   </strong>
  </em>
  has impressive cutscenes, with some incredibly well-designed levels for when players dive into the gameplay. The combat is deep and satisfying but features quite a learning curve. This is coupled with an even deeper level of development of the player's characters when not in combat situations.

  Hearst Industries is a large, abandoned factory located in the Broken Delta region of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It's a challenging area filled with dangerous enemies but is rich in loot, with various crates scattered around. One of the main objectives in Hearst Industries is to
  <strong>
   find at least one Weapon or Gear crate.
  </strong>

  The Hearst Industries Rift Anchor is located in the southwest part of the map
  <strong>
   (coordinates: 6130, -6022)
  </strong>
  in the parking lot guarded by two Ghouls. Use your map to track the Rift Anchor and right-click to set a waypoint.

      <title>A Plague Tale’s Future Needs One Last of Us Stealth Mechanic It Nearly Had</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    A Plague Tale: Requiem
   </em>
  </strong>
  and its predecessor weren’t the first games to break into the companion subgenre of immersive storytelling. That said, while what they achieved may not be as widely celebrated as
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , they have left quite a few indelible marks that are uniquely their own, particularly with regard to the stealth-oriented gameplay that
  <em>
   Plague Tale
  </em>
  prides itself on. But even though
  <em>
   A Plague Tale: Requiem
  </em>
  delves a considerable degree further into actual combat than it arguably needed to, it also makes some interesting changes to
  <em>
   A Plague Tale: Innocence
  </em>
  ’s staple stealth mechanics.

 <p>
  Nearly all of
  <em>
   Innocence
  </em>
  ’s stealth mechanics are intact in
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  but with slight tweaks, for better or for worse. Eventually giving Hugo a Witcher Sense when rats are around is a low point, to be sure, whereas being able to slip through narrow passages is a neat traversal interaction that is highly reminiscent of
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  also allows Amicia to quickly lie prone to crawl beneath carts and beds, but she cannot go prone and crawl around whenever or wherever she’d like as Ellie can in
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  . That’s now undoubtedly a feature that a third
  <em>
   Plague Tale
  </em>
  should add if one
  <em>
  </em>
  was to ever follow
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  One of the biggest influences
  <em>
   A Plague Tale: Requiem
  </em>
  seems to draw from
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  is its use of shivs and shiv doors concealing a room full of loot. In
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  , this takes the form of locked workshop cabinets that can only be pried open with infrequently discovered knives, meaning players miss out on valuable rewards and an opportunity to spend them on upgrades if they chose to jam their knife into an enemy sometime earlier.

 <p>
  However, while
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  had many years to contemplate how it could adapt
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ’ shivs, it couldn’t have known that
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  would introduce prone movement for stealth purposes. If Asobo had known that, perhaps it would’ve considered legitimate prone mechanics in its
  <em>
   Plague Tale
  </em>
  sequel.

 <p>
  Either way, if
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  ’s abrupt post-credits tease and job listing rumors point to a third game potentially being in development, it would be phenomenal to see stealth mechanics extrapolated on.
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  came close to breaking that mold and having Amicia able to go prone and sneak by soldiers in tall foliage while snaking around their feet, but instead stealth was largely the same as it was in
  <em>
   Innocence
  </em>
  .

     puts a stronger emphasis on combat by giving Amicia a crossbow and more melee options than before in order to punctuate how her rage affects Hugo directly, though there are still plenty of anxiety-inducing cat-and-mouse encounters like the one where Amicia evades the Count while nursing a recently dislocated shoulder.

  What Stealth Could Look Like in a Hypothetical Plague Tale Threequel

 <p>
  Slipping between narrow passages is a fantastic mechanic the sequel added and is imperative when circumventing the Count, for instance, but going prone could’ve made ordinary stealth encounters with multiple soldiers far more dynamic as well. It would be interesting to see how that could come to fruition since
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  ’s post-credits scene suggests the series could be transitioning to a far-future setting relative to the present day.

 <p>
  Prone mechanics would be great nonetheless and how stealth is designed will need to take into consideration the setting and era most of all. With any luck, a third
  <em>
   Plague Tale
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  would continue to make stealth a priority as it is one of the biggest defining traits of the franchise thus far and deserves to be iterated on more than it was in
  <em>
   Requiem
  </em>
  , even if it needs to lean more heavily on
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  for supplementary inspiration.

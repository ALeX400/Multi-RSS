      Lud and Zallen: Easy to read moves, not the best but fun and fair fight.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dark Souls
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise is well known for its high difficulty level that requires both patience and resilience from players. Over the years, fans have developed a strong love-hate relationship with many bosses from this universe, as most of them are extremely punishing, but also fair.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said when two or more bosses gang up on players and put them at a significant disadvantage. In such cases, catlike reflexes, sturdy armor, proper Estus Flask management, strong weapons, and swift reaction times are necessary to survive. Here are the
  <strong>
   best multi-boss fights in the
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
   games
  </strong>

  Compared to other multi-boss fights in the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  franchise,
  <strong>
   Lud and Zallen
  </strong>
  's is far from being the best. However, the feline creatures do pose a challenge and are fun to fight overall. In fact, it would be safe to say that Lud and Zallen are one of the great elements of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , despite the bad reputation that the game has among critics and veteran fans.
 </p>

 <p>
  They don't have a sophisticated moveset and their attacks are frequently clearly telegraphed, making them easy to dodge once players learn their patterns. Moreover, Zallen doesn't jump into the arena until Lud has lost a considerable amount of Health, making the fight somewhat simpler than others where players must fight two or more enemies with full Health bars simultaneously. All in all, while Lud and Zallen's is not the most fun or challenging multi-boss fight in the series, they are a blast to defeat and are arguably one of the high points of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2.
  </em>

  Once players complete the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dark Souls 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  base game, they might think that they have the necessary tools to take on any other challenge the DLCs might throw at them. However, most are quickly humbled when they enter the Ringed City DLC and get a taste of the merciless attacks of the various enemies in the area, and the deadly power behind them.

  After falling from a cliff, players will take a long plunge into a circular arena deep inside the Ringed City's bowels—there, they will find the
  <strong>
   Demon in Pain
  </strong>
  , and the
  <strong>
   Demon from Below
  </strong>
  . While the Demon in Pain and Demon from Below are not the most difficult bosses in the Ringed City, their attacks are quite challenging to dodge, especially if players are using the lock-on feature. Both demons have absurdly long range and are very aggressive with their attacks, so players will have a very hard time finding good windows of opportunity. Although this multi-boss fight does require a ton of skill, patience will be the most important aspect to surviving this encounter. As long as players don't get greedy, they'll be able to defeat both demons and face off against this fight's final challenge: the
  <strong>
   Demon Prince
  </strong>
  .

  Few games have final bosses as worthy of the title as
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  's
  <strong>
   Lothric
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Lorian
  </strong>
  , the Twin Princes. While players will have already visited Lothric Castle early in the game, they won't be able to gain access to these two bosses until they defeat the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and clear out the rest of the Castle. At first, Lothric and Lorian don't seem to be too much of a threat, as the former sits back and watches while the latter attacks players in an aggressive, yet telegraphed way that can easily be read with enough practice.

 <p>
  The real challenge begins when players finally deplete Lorian's health bar, thinking they finally beat him. Lothric will slowly approach his brother's corpse and reanimate him, climbing on his back for mobility. At that point, players will not only have to deal with Lorian's melee attacks, but also with Lothric's ranged magic spells that can do a lot of damage in the blink of an eye. The epicness of this encounter, along with the combination of melee and ranged attacks make this multi-boss fight one of the best in the series.

 <p>
  Players should take into account that focusing on killing Lorian will never end the boss fight, as Lothric will keep reviving him over and over. Players should either focus on Lothric to melt his Health bar or kill Lorian and attack Lothric aggressively as he heals his brother.

  While the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  is full of challenging areas and tough bosses, few are as testing as
  <strong>
   Ornstein &amp; Smough
  </strong>
  . This duo can be found in Anor Londo and is, to this day, one of the greatest skill checks in gaming history. Ornstein and Smough are unfortunately not optional, so players must deal with them to progress through the story and eventually complete the game. During this exciting and punishing boss fight, players will have to keep an eye on both enemies, as one false step or distraction can be the end.

 <p>
  In most cases, dealing with one enemy should make the fight easier; however, this is not the case with Ornstein &amp; Smough. In fact, when players defeat one of them, the other will gain an intimidating amount of power and size, raising the stakes considerably. Players who want the easier alternative should kill Ornstein first to face giant Smough. He's still very challenging, but his moveset is much more lenient than that of giant Ornstein.

 <p>
  That said, players should know that they will get the armor of the enemy they faced last, so if they want Ornstein's armor, they'll have to kill Smough first and take on the harder alternative.

  Last, but certainly not least, there's
  <strong>
   Sister Friede
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Father Ariandel
  </strong>
  . Found in the late stages of Dark Souls 3's Ashes of Ariandel DLC, this duo pose a significant challenge. Before facing them, players will have to defeat Sister Friede and deplete her Health bar. Once they do, Father Ariandel will join the fight, using his golden bowl to spew fire and engulf the arena in flames. Dealing with both enemies is challenging, as Father Ariandel is quite large, and Sister Friede is very fast, making for a deadly combination.

 <p>
  Players will have to focus on dodging Father Ariandel's smashing attacks and Friede's ice spells, which can quickly cause Frostbite. One of the elements that make this multi-boss fight great is that it tricks players into thinking they've won after defeating the duo, only to surprise them with a third phase where Blackflame Friede steps in. Blackflame Friede is much more aggressive than she was in her first phase and can one-shot players in the blink of an eye.

  Sony has unveiled the file size for
  <strong>
   <em>
    LEGO Horizon Adventures
   </em>
  </strong>
  on Switch and PC, detailing that the game's file size will be 5.9 GB and 30 GB, respectively. Based on the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series developed by Guerrilla Games,
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  will land on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 14, 2024.

 <p>
  All things considered, the existence of
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  says less about the popularity of the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series than about the inevitability of
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  collaborating with seemingly every pop culture franchise under the sun. Though
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games existed before them, TT Games developing
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars
  </em>
  and many future
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  spin-offs was in many ways the beginning of the modern
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  game phenomenon. And now
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  is getting more into video game-based crossovers, ranging from medium-defining brands like Nintendo and
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  . to
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  also promises to be the first day-one multi-platform launch for the series, with previous games in the series debuting on PlayStation consoles first.

  Though the file size for
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is shown on the game's Switch and Steam pages, the figure is absent on
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  's "home" platform, the PlayStation 5. This is due to the fact that PSN Store pages don't typically list file sizes. Given the relative similarities between platforms, though, it may be safe to assume that players aiming to put
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series heroine Aloy and her friends in their minifig forms on PS5 may need to clear around 30 gigabytes of space as well.

 <p>
  It's notable that the Switch version of
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is significantly smaller, clocking in at less than a third of the PC file size. Given the relatively underpowered hardware of the Switch compared to the PS5 and even lower-end gaming PCs, the small file size probably reflects the efforts made by developers to squeeze games onto the handheld console. That said, developers Studio Gobo and Guerilla Games seem to have compressed the Switch version particularly well. For comparison with another major
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  title like
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  , clocks in at about 40 GB on PC, 36 GB on PS5, and 15.8 GB on Switch.

 <p>
  It will be interesting to see how
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  does on Switch. Though
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  is now a multi-platform franchise thanks to the PlayStation-published versions on PC, Switch-exclusive gamers might have no experience with the series given its lack of presence outside PlayStation platforms. A successful debut, though, could validate the change in Sony attitudes regarding
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  and other exclusive franchises and games.

  There are three sets of Dragon Balls for players to find in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO
   </em>
  </strong>
  , each of which summons a different dragon. Much like in the series itself, Shenron, Porunga, and Super Shenron all have different abilities when it comes to the kind of wishes that they're able to grant, making some Dragon Balls a lot more valuable than others.

   Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  , allowing players to make as many wishes as they like providing they're willing to put in the hard work. The following guide will explain the best ways to get Dragon Balls in
  <em>

  </em>
  as well as information about all of the different wishes that players can make after doing so.

  There are a few different ways to get Dragon Balls in
  <em>
   Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  . The easiest is to purchase the season pass or the Ultimate edition of the game, which will allow players to summon Shenron and Super Shenron respectively. As the first season pass is included with the Ultimate edition, it effectively includes both. Players can also receive two full sets of Super Dragon Balls by completing all of the
  <strong>
   Episode Battles
  </strong>
  for Goku and Future Trunks, as well as a set of regular Dragon Balls for completing some of
  <strong>
   Zen-Oh's Orders
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Whis's Wishes
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  In terms of repeated usage, players can farm Shenron and Porunga Dragon Balls by
  <strong>
   completing regular battles
  </strong>
  . The drop rate is incredibly low, but by choosing a stage with Out-of-Bounds and equipping the Rising Fighting Spirit Ability Item (available in the shop for 150,000 Zeni), players can start each fight by firing off a special and secure a ring-out in a matter of seconds. This is also a great way to improve character proficiency, as players can level up to five
  <em>
   Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  fighters up at once. They should expect to get a Dragon Ball once every twenty to thirty fights.

  As mentioned above, each of the three Dragons has its own unique qualities. Shenron will allow players to skip an Episode Battle, Porunga grants three wishes instead of just one, and Super Shenron allows players to unlock two playable fighters (although both of these can be purchased from the shop once players hit Player Level 20). Most of their other wishes are the same, although the amount of Zeni that players will get from the "I want more Zeni" wish varies from dragon to dragon, with Super Shenron offering the most (1,000,000 Zeni) and Shenron offering the least (300,000 Zeni).

  The constant patches change which
  <em>
   Valorant

  abilities are the best, but consistently there are some abilities between the various agents that allow for huge advantages to players who are able to use them. Some of the usages of certain abilities are situational, but some abilities are always useful to have around.

   Although Valorant is updated frequently, and various abilities are often nerfed or changed entirely, many of the same abilities manage to stay on top of the power ratings for extended periods. Their usage is key to much of the strategy in Valorant.

  Although an individual ability doesn't necessarily make an agent one of the very best in the game, some of these abilities are still game-changers in the right situation. Valorant is a game of strategy and trying to keep it balanced is a non-stop task that requires constant supervision. For this reason, this article will continue to receive updates as the abilities in Valorant continue to change.

 <p>
  Viper's ultimate ability creates a huge poisonous cloud that covers a large area. This allows Viper to hide inside and protect the spike if it is active, or a site alternatively. Either way, it completely blocks enemies from the area for as long as Viper stays inside, and decays enemies who step within, making any fight a hefty advantage to Viper.

 <p>
  Because of her abilities, in particular this ultimate, Viper has the title of being the best spike defender in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  . Enemies stepping into the Viper's Pit will have reduced visibility and so little health that Viper can shut them down easily. Taking on multiple enemies and clutching looks a lot more possible with the Viper's Pit helping, making it one of the most consistently overpowered ultimate abilities in the game.

 <p>
  Few ultimate abilities can shift a round in the direction of the player like Yoru's Dimensional Drift. This ability allows Yoru to enter an invulnerable, invisible state for enough time to get out of an area or sneak behind some enemies to catch them unawares.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1021} -->

 <p>
  While Yoru is drifting, he can still use other abilities, allowing him to blind enemies for teammates, or to allow himself time to come out of the drift and kill them unawares. This makes for a brutal ultimate ability that can turn a round on its head. Yoru's abilities make him a strong agent already, but this in particular can devastate an entire enemy team if used properly and in conjunction with allies.

  Reyna is considered one of the best individual characters in the game. If a team is working well together, they can bring down even a great Reyna player. But in a situation where both teams are doing their own thing, Reyna is devastating. Devour is one of the best abilities in the game because it allows Reyna to heal herself using the corpse of an enemy.

 <p>
  This capability makes it very difficult to take down Reyna when she goes on a rampage, and especially at lower levels, players will often find a Reyna near the top of the scoreboard as one of the best duelist characters in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  for picking up kills near-continuously as the rounds go by. Devour is not Reyna’s only great ability, but it is the one that allows her to trade health in duels and regain that health to be at full strength again for more individual battles.

  Killjoy’s ultimate ability, named after her, has been steadily becoming stronger and a more vitally game-changing ability over recent patches. Since Chamber was brutally nerfed by Riot Games, Killjoy is the best Sentinel in the game and her ultimate ability is a major part of what makes her great.

  The ultimate deploys an attack with a wide range which contains and totally paralyzes enemy players caught inside of it. This can be used while the spike is planted to chase off all opposition, and almost no enemy utility can destroy it before the lockdown is complete anymore.

 <p>
  Cypher has always been a great character to have on a
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  team, primarily because of the frustration involved in trying to sneak up behind him. Cypher’s trip wire is a valuable piece of utility that stops enemies from getting near him often.

 <p>
  While this is valuable in itself, the trip wire can also be used to block enemies in a rush to enter a site that Cypher is holding. Adding this to his camera and other utility makes Cypher a deadly opponent to try and get the drop on for any player or character.

  Jett is one of the most continuously beloved agents in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  . Meta changes are constantly shifting the landscape of which characters are best in the professional setting, but Jett is almost always one of the top duelists in the game. Currently, it is pretty much undeniable.

 <p>
  With new maps released where she flourishes, and a move set which is always devastating to square off against, Jett is one of the greatest agents in
  <em>
   Valorant

  . Her updraft ability is huge, enabling her to get to locations quickly and easily that are inaccessible to almost every other agent in the game.

 <p>
  Gekko is one of the newest agents in
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  and while the Meta could change at any time, he is still considered to be hugely overpowered. His Wingman ability is one of the more unique ideas that Riot Games have added to a character’s ability, having several uses but one in particular which can be devastating.

 <p>
  When Gekko has the spike, Wingman can take it and plant it for him, enabling him to continue shooting at enemies in the meantime. It can also defuse the spike similarly for him, which is completely ludicrous and will possibly be nerfed in the future. This ability is great for new players trying to learn how to gain points quickly.

 <p>
  Reyna once again appears for this move which can devastate players, again used more at lower levels of play than at professional ones. Even so, Leer is a devastating move that is incredibly difficult to deal with. It blinds enemies and can be fired through walls, but can be destroyed by enemies.

 <p>
  The problem is that this weakness is actually another strength. Either enemies stay blind or snap to destroy the leer, which allows Reyna to snap around a corner and hit them while they are distracted. Both ways, Reyna gets the advantage and the win with minimal danger to herself at all times.

  Sova is another agent who has long been considered one of the best in
  <em>

  . Despite nerfs in the past limiting some of his abilities, Sova has stayed near the top of the game. Part of that reason is the incredible versatility of abilities such as the Shock Arrow.

  This damaging AOE shot can be fired from Sova’s bow with the player choosing how many times it will bounce before landing. This is one of the most complicated pieces of equipment to get to grips with in

  , but it is worth it as one of the very best there is because of how many places it can hit, eliminating enemies hiding in many difficult-to-reach corners.

  is not an open-world game, players can’t be blamed for thinking that it is due to how extensive and complex this title's map is. Featuring strategic combat and a great system that encourages players to hunt monsters, also referred to as “Marks”, throughout the Kingdom of Ivalice, this game offers tons of fun and a complete, entertaining experience for anyone looking for an adventure.

 <p>
  There is a considerable variety of Marks spread throughout the Kingdom of Ivalice, ranging from common beasts to vicious monsters that will not hesitate to attack players and end their run early. Like in similar games in this genre, players will have to plan out tactical approaches to defeat Marks, ensuring that they've studied every creature carefully in order to maximize their chances of success.

   <strong>
    God Eater 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is arguably one of the best JRPGs of the last decade. With fast-paced action and intense adrenaline-rushing combat, this game focuses heavily on the hunting of creatures known as Aragami. As they explore the world, players will control characters wielding powerful weapons known as God Arcs, which are not only very effective at dealing with Aragami, but also play a key role in the game’s story.

 <p>
  Like other creatures in this genre, the Aragami can range from lesser threats to world-ending beings that will stop at nothing to fulfill their evil purposes. One of the greatest features of this game is character customization, as players can choose from several different character abilities, weapon loadouts, and battle styles.
  <em>
   God Eater 3
  </em>
  also features a robust multiplayer system that allows players to cooperate from the very beginning. Overall, this title offers a very complete experience for players who are fans of the Monster Hunter franchise and want a similar, yet very different experience in many areas.

  According to the game's lore, hellions are created from impurities resulting from the negative emotions of humanity.
  <em>
   Tales of Zestiria

  explains that hellions are a threat to humanity, which not only justifies the need to haunt them, but also adds another layer of complexity to the story. The game features various party members with different abilities and fast-paced combat that’s always fun and pleasing to look at.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Blue Dragon
   </strong>
  </em>
  will have players control a group of young heroes who have been imbued with the power of shadow creatures. These brave protagonists will have to fight monsters and hunt them down throughout the vast world the game is set in. Unlike other games on this list which are based on real-time combat mechanics,
  <em>
   Blue Dragon
  </em>
  opts for a turn-based approach instead.

  While
  <em>
   Blue Dragon
  </em>
  does not feature open-world mechanics as complex as other games do, it does have some non-linear action, even when it's often story-restricted. The game offers hours of fun for players as they take on different creatures to reach their ultimate goal. All in all, while the game is a bit lacking on the exploration side of things, it really shines in terms of its combat and its interesting concept of powerful shadow creatures.

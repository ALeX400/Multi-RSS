 <p>
  First, you need a tomato for the recipe. You can get tomatoes from
  <strong>
   Dazzle Beach
  </strong>
  , one of the early-game biomes in the game. Go to this biome and repair Goofy’s stall, then upgrade it twice for 1,000 and 2,000 Star Coins. Once upgraded, Dreamers will be able to buy Tomato Seeds from Goofy for
  <strong>
   eight Star Coins
  </strong>
  each.

 <p>
  Next, you will need to plant and water the tomato seeds, then wait 25 minutes for them to grow. Once they're ready, simply pick them up from the ground. If you are short on time, you also have the option to buy ripe tomatoes for
  <strong>
   33 Star Coins
  </strong>
  each. Like other biomes in Dreamlight Valley, Dazzle Beach is locked initially, and gamers will have to spend 1,000 Dreamlight in order to access it. This vegetable-type ingredient is used in many delicious recipes, such as Club Sandwich, Greek Pizza, Veggie Pasta, and more.

  Among the most popular soccer games on the market,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Football Manager
   </em>
  </strong>
  by Sports Interactive stands out from its competitors. In this game, players do not control the athletes on the field during matches - as they do in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   eFootball -
  </em>
  but rather assume the role of managers who oversee the entire club, organizing training sessions, transfers, and match tactics.

 <p>
  Additionally, one of the franchise's major innovations introduced in 2009 was the game's 3D Match Engine, which allowed matches to be played out more dynamically. For the 2025 edition, SI Games plans to update the engine to Unity, marking the end of a legacy of great
  <em>
   Football Manager
  </em>
  versions. These enhancements make it one of the best soccer management games available.

  The 2009 edition of
  <em>
   Football Manager
  </em>
  was a milestone for the franchise, introducing players to its new 3D graphics engine. Being the first time SI Games implemented these changes and having been released over a decade ago, the game is somewhat clunky and lacks the fluidity of more recent editions.
  <strong>
   However, it was a significant change for its time, solidifying it as one of the top soccer manager games.

 <p>
  Furthermore,
  <em>
   Football Manager 09
  </em>
  also introduced other elements that became key to the franchise. For the first time, female managers could be created, and press conferences were introduced, where players could answer various questions from journalists, enhancing immersion and providing a more authentic manager experience.

  The release of
  <em>
   Football Manager 2013
  </em>
  was filled with new features for fans of the franchise.
  <strong>
   The main changes aimed to make gameplay faster, especially for those players who wanted to quickly reach match day.
  </strong>
  Called
  <em>
   Football Manager Classic
  </em>
  , this option streamlined various player management processes.

 <p>
  Another new addition this year was the Challenge Mode, which placed players in different scenarios that needed to be resolved within half a season, testing each player's skills in the game. Although many preferred to stick with the traditional gameplay, it was a good addition for those looking for something different in their save.

  In addition to the standard minor enhancements to the game's 3D engine, such as improved player AI and better lighting,
  <em>
   Football Manager 2014
  </em>
  <strong>
   introduced significant changes to the tactical system, marking it as one of the best Football Manager games for advanced strategy enthusiasts.

 <p>
  Instructions were now more complex, mirroring how coaches would give instructions to players in real life. While this brought
  <em>

  closer to realism, some players struggled to adapt to these changes. Ultimately, the game was a success, selling over one million copies.

 <p>
  The primary change in
  <em>
   Football Manager 2018
  </em>
  was the addition of the Dynamics system, where managers could better understand what was happening in the minds of their players. This tool was useful for understanding what was affecting each player's morale, making it one of the top soccer management games for player interactions.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This system also displayed the influence of each player within the squad,
  <strong>
   with social groups forming among them, potentially leading to issues if the squad was not well-managed.
  </strong>
  However, if managers could effectively control each player's ego, the results would be positive in the long run, with the team functioning more cohesively.

 <p>
  VAR began to be incorporated into major European soccer leagues during the 17-18 season. Therefore, for
  <em>
   Football Manager 2019
  </em>
  , one of SI Games' innovations was adding this system to the game. Like in real-life sports, this element received mixed reactions from fans, but it solidified this edition as one of the best versions of Football Manager for realistic match experiences.

 <p>
  <strong>
   However, the main innovations were related to tactical elements, the core aspect of the game. Now, tactics needed to be thought of in three phases: possession, transition, and out-of-possession.
  </strong>
  This became vital for club success and allowed players to have greater control over how teams behaved in each game phase.

  One of the major innovations in
  <em>
   Football Manager 2021
  </em>
  was the update to the Match Engine AI, making actions on the field more unpredictable and fluid. Players could now adjust their decisions as the game developed, while defenders reacted more intelligently to offensive movements.

 <p>
  Additionally, the game's interface was redesigned, and graphics were more detailed.
  <strong>
   Another highlight was the introduction of the match analysis system, with advanced metrics such as Expected Goals (xG).
  </strong>
  These additions provided a deeper insight into team performance, allowing for more informed and precise tactical decisions - establishing it as one of the top
  <em>

  In
  <em>
   Football Manager 2022
  </em>
  , the animations were revamped, separating 3D from the 2D engine, allowing for more freedom in creating animations.
  <strong>
   This change improved player movements, making actions more realistic.
  </strong>
  Additionally, the new game engine enhanced match AI, optimizing decision-making, such as when to dribble or pass, and introducing a more intelligent pressing system, marking it as one of the best versions for tactical diversity.

 <p>
  Another major addition was the new "Wide Centre-Back" position, allowing central defenders to play wider, supporting the midfield like full-backs. This brought more tactical versatility to the game, catering to different play styles and strategic needs of managers.

  Over the years, SI Games' engine has undergone various changes and enhancements, making
  <em>
   Football Manager 2024
  </em>
  the definitive edition.
  <strong>
   Player animations in the 3D engine have become more fluid, while rewritten ball physics make matches more realistic for viewers.
  </strong>

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Besides these changes and the addition of the Japanese League, another feature that pleased players was the new Set Pieces system, giving managers more control over how teams acted in free kicks, corners, and throw-ins, making these plays even more dangerous. This ensures it remains one of the top soccer management games for set-piece enthusiasts.

 <p>
  One of
  <strong>
   <em>

  's most interesting mechanics is the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink display-card-hyperlink-no-vignette" data-id="660888" style="; ;">
   Flask of Wondrous Physick
  </span>
  . With the wide range of potential benefits offered by
  <strong>
   Crystal Tears
  </strong>
  , it's not surprising that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  builds on the mechanic, adding 8 incredibly unique new Crystal Tears for players to experiment with. Like the base game, these new tears are specialized to target and enhance a specific gameplay element, such as the attack power of Spirit Summons. This guide will show players
  <strong>
   how to find all 8 new Crystal Tears in the
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
   DLC
  </strong>
  , and explain exactly how they are meant to be used.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
   </strong>
  </em>
  on PC will be coming out with the controversial Denuvo, which may cause some concern for fans of the series. The
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  franchise in itself has a huge following stemming from all four mainline games and its spin-offs, as well as the lesser-known movies. While the
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  may have made fans excited, the discovery that Denuvo will be present may be an issue.

 <p>
  As the trailers and information for the upcoming
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  have confirmed that the game will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, many fans have been scouring all available news regarding the title. While the bonuses and new mechanics seem to be a hit for many gamers, some PC players may be having second thoughts just because of the inclusion of Denuvo.

  <em>

  </em>
  's Steam page confirms that the game will incorporate the third-party DRM Denuvo. While developers think highly of the software due to the safety Denuvo provides, recent incidents involving other games which use the technology have raised some concerns about whether the security measures it provides limit the accessibility and ownership of players whenever issues arise with Denuvo's servers. With the game releasing on September 19, 2024, it will be just a few months to find out how
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  's playability will be affected by the Denuvo. Other gamers have reported their negative experiences like slowdown and lagging from other games which use the security measure.

 <p>
  Outside of Capcom, one such instance was when
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  Royal was rendered unplayable in early May. While Denuvo claimed that there were no server outages at the time, many fans lashed out and blamed the anti-piracy software for the inability to play the title. While temporary fixes such as launching the title without online functionality would allow access, many players believed that the makeshift workaround was not a solution. Offline playing limits certain features of each game, and this might cause some dissatisfaction for those who want to experience their games fully.

  However, previous reports state that there may be new Denuvo technology coming soon. It hasn't been stated how different it will be from the existing software, but some fans are hopeful that it will cause fewer problems than before. Granted, issues from the server side of things also have to be addressed first. Whether
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  will use existing or new Denuvo technology hasn't been confirmed yet, but some fans are expressing concern about how it may affect their experience. Hopefully, by the time the game releases, the experience will be smooth so that players don't turn on Capcom and
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The first thing you’ll need to make this recipe is the Sand Worm. It’s a unique fish found in the Glittering Dunes biome in Eternity Isle. To obtain it, head to a sand pool for fishing in any of these three regions:

 <p>
  Once you are there, look for
  <strong>
   orange ripples
  </strong>
  in the sand pool and cast your line. Glittering Dunes is initially locked, so you'll need to complete Jafar’s quest, The Sands In the Hourglass, to access it. The Plains area is free, but you'll need
  <strong>
   4,000 Mists to enter The Wastes and 10,000 Mists for The Borderlands.
  </strong>
  The recipe only requires one Sand Worm, so if you catch extra, you can sell each one for 800 Star Coins at the Goofy’s Stall or store it for future use.

 <p>
  Melon is the second ingredient that you need to get to make the meal. This fruit-type ingredient is available to purchase at the Goofy’s shop in The Plains area of the Glittering Dunes.

 <p>
  As mentioned above, this area is unlocked by default, so fast travel there, go to Goofy’s Stall, and spend 40 Star Coins to get melon seeds. Plant the seeds and wait 30 minutes for them to grow. Apart from the Sand Worm Carpaccio Plate, melons are also used to make Melon Boba Tea.

  With both of the ingredients in your backpack, head to a cooking station and toss the Sand Worm and melon into the cooking pot. And yes, you will also need one coal to start cooking. Once the Sand Worm Carpaccio Plate is ready, you can
  <strong>
   eat it to replenish 3,004 energy or sell it at Goofy’s shop for 1,160 Star Coins.

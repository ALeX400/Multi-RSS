  An extremely rare cosmetic upgrade for the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  pickaxe is back in the in-game item shop for players to pick up. The pickaxe is one of the rarest items in the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  shop, as it hasn't been available for multiple years.

 <p>
  Thanks in part to a business model based on regularly adding and selling cosmetic upgrades,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is practically bursting with an array of thousands of items for players to acquire. While many can be earned for free via the Battle Pass, more are sold in the in-game store. One problem with that model is that the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Item Shop rotation regularly brings items new and old in and out of availability. Inevitably, some players may miss out on a shop item they might've liked otherwise.

 <p>
  Some players might have been waiting longer than most, such as those who missed a chance to pick up the "Jagged Edge" pickaxe model. As confirmed by a post from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  news account ShiinaBR, the Jagged Edge is back in the Item Shop for the first time in nearly five years. Technically speaking, the Jagged Edge is merely an Uncommon (Green) Rarity pickaxe, but what makes it one of the rarest pickaxes in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is the sheer amount of time that has passed since it was last available.

 <p>
  As a mere Item Shop pickaxe, the Jagged Edge is a fairly mundane design: It is a dual-wield type
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  harvesting tool consisting of a pair of hand axes with spikes on the blades. Yet it hasn't been included in the store rotation since August 2019. For context, that was midway through
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Season 10, before the monumental events of "The End," that saw the island destroyed by a black hole, and the universe reborn as
  <em>
   Fortnite

  Chapter 2.

 <p>
  Perhaps it's a testament to how long it has been since the last time the Jagged Edge was in the store that developer Epic Games has begun running original
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG seasons as limited-time events focused on nostalgic recall for earlier versions of the game. It seems almost quaint to be nostalgic for a game that, in the eyes of older players, is little older than a single console cycle, but it also demonstrates
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's staying power since its earliest days, when it was first reinvented as a Battle Royale game to capitalize on the then-new trend sweeping multiplayer gaming.

  There's a ton of items hidden in secret rooms or quests (or both) in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and if players want to get as many trinkets as possible during a single campaign run, they'll need to know what does which. The Bookbound Medallion is one such item that can potentially lead to secret treasures, but the game doesn't tell players what to do with this item.

  The Forlorn Coast is the first area players explore right after starting

  , and if you've found the Misplaced Memoir hidden in this area, you can interact with it to receive the Bookbound Medallion, which can be exchanged for some nifty accessories.

 <p>
  As mentioned, you first need to find the Misplaced Memoir. It's somewhere in the Forlorn Coast, so make sure to pay attention while exploring or looking for the Ritualist's class item. Once you have the book, interact with it to get the Bookbound Medallion.

 <p>
  It's worth noting that the
  <strong>
   Burden of the Sciolist
  </strong>
  is the superior item here. The fire rate
  <strong>
   bonus from the Ring of Infinite Damage is barely noticeable
  </strong>
  , and it's mostly a joke item that Leywise gives to players out of spite. It's good if you want to maximize your rate of fire, but without other effects that boost your fire rate, this ring is not worth using.

 <h3 id="other-choices-other-items">
  Other Choices, Other Items

 <p>
  If you give the Misplaced Memoir to Leywise instead of interacting with it, you'll get the
  <strong>
   Index of the Scribe
  </strong>
  , an Amulet that
  <strong>
   increases Mod and Skill Weakspot Damage by 35%
  </strong>
  . It's an excellent choice for a
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  Archon build or any other setup that makes heavy use of mods and precision damage.

 <p>
  Alternatively, instead of giving the Bookbound Medallion to Leywise, you can go to the
  <strong>
   Chamber of the Faithless in Losomn
  </strong>
  and use it to enter the Library, which contains the
  <strong>
   Paper Heart Relic.
  </strong>
  This heals players for 100% of their max health almost instantly. However, it also gives them stacks of Paper Health. Each stack of this effect will turn your 10% of your HP into Grey Health after 15 seconds, though one stack can be removed by defeating an enemy or dealing enough damage to targets.

 <p>
  The story of the
  <strong>
   Sega Saturn
  </strong>
  is both fascinating and tragic. It was released in 1994 in Japan, followed by a North American release in 1995. Unfortunately for Sega, Sony had a more promising console in the PS1, which launched in the same year, 1994, and at a cheaper price.

 <p>
  This certainly didn’t give the Sega Saturn a good starting point, and it only got worse from there despite a good lineup of games over the years. There were a lot of great
  <strong>
   RPGs on the Sega Saturn
  </strong>
  , for example, made by first-party and third-party teams. Many games remain lost to time because that library, from platformers to RPGs, has mostly not left the console. For now, let’s focus on some standout RPGs from the Sega Saturn's era.

   While Sony completely destroyed its competition with the original PlayStation when it was released, this shouldn't take away from the fact that the Sega Saturn had some great titles in different genres. While it's very difficult to come by a Sega Saturn in good condition nowadays, there's certainly still a market for the console and the games that were released for it.

 <p>
  Sega Saturn's RPGs not only provided players with hours of fun, but also helped define the genre further during the late 90s, paving the road for other titles in the early 2000s, and even modern games that are massive hits today.

   <em>
    Shining the Holy Ark

  is a first-person dungeon-crawler game released in 1996. This title is part of the

With turn-based combat and various different elements for players to take advantage of during fights, there's always fun to be had with this title.

 <p>
  The point of the
  <em>
   Super Robot Taisen
  </em>
  series is to get a bunch of mech-based anime and game franchises together for one big crossover tactical RPG. Not many main entries or spinoffs of this series have left Japan, and the same is true for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Robot Taisen F
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This is an important entry in the franchise though, because it introduced
  <em>
   Neon Genesis Evangelion
  </em>
  for the first time.

 <p>
  Another great addition was
  <em>
   Gunbuster,
  </em>
  which was another Gainax anime that is a bit more obscure when compared to
  <em>
   Evangelion
  </em>
  . Other anime in the game included various
  <em>
   Gundam
  </em>
  seasons, like
  <em>
   G Gundam
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gundam Wing,
  </em>
  along with
  <em>
   Mazinger
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Getter Robo
  </em>
  . It’s hard to play in Japanese, but it is a good RPG all the same.

   Lunar: The Silver Star

  is the first entry in the series, which would debut for the Sega CD in 1992, with a North American release to follow in 1993.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an enhanced addition, with more content and gameplay tweaks, which hit the Sega Saturn in 1996. North America wouldn’t get to play this version until 1999 with its PS1 port.

 <p>
  It was ahead of its time for a turn-based game, as it added some tactical elements like moving close to directly hit an enemy before a fight started. Players could see monsters in dungeons, and there was an autobattle feature too. There have been many ports over the years, but the Sega Saturn version is up there with the best of them.

   <em>
    Princess Crown
   </em>
  </strong>
  was developed by Atlus, but avid fans of Vanillaware games like
  <em>
   Odin Sphere
  </em>
  may notice a close resemblance. George Kamitani, the director, left Atlus to help form Vanillaware.
  <em>
   Princess Crown
  </em>
  had multiple scenarios, like Odin Sphere, and combat was action-oriented on a 2D plain, again, like many Vanillaware games.

  It played kind of like a fighting game, as random battles were usually against one enemy or several at most. Unfortunately, there has never been a release in English territories and there is no fan patch either for this version, the PSP port, or the PS4 port. It’s disappointing for Vanillaware fans especially, since it was a great-looking and playing RPG on the Sega Saturn.

   <em>
    Magic Knight Rayearth

  </strong>
  was based on a manga and anime of the same name. The manga began in Japan in 1993 with the anime to follow a year later. A year after that, this Sega Saturn game was released in 1995, followed by a long wait for North American players in 1998. The story follows three teens, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, who are swept into a fantasy world from Japan.

 <p>
  It’s a classic isekai setup and the gameplay is like an entry in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  franchise. It’s a top-down world filled with treasure, monsters, and dungeons. Players could swap between all three girls, who each had different weapons and powers. Fuu, for example, used wind magic and carried a bow.

   <em>
    Dragon Force

  </strong>
  , not to be confused with the power metal band, was released in Japan and North America in 1996, which was almost unheard of in the 90s. The tactical gameplay was similar to Nintendo’s Advance Wars series, wherein players could choose an army to follow. They would deploy troops around a map, conquering territories as they moved along.

 <p>
  It had a board game-like nature to its design, and battles were mostly automatic but epic as they displayed tons of sprites onscreen duking it out. The game got a PS2 port in Japan in 2005, but it was never released in the West. There was also a sequel in 1998 on the Sega Saturn, but that too has yet to leave Japan.

  The
  <em>
   Shining
  </em>
  series is one of the most prolific on Sega consoles.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shining Force 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  continued the tradition of tactical grid-based gameplay that fans had grown to know and love since the Sega Genesis. It was co-developed with Camelot, who now works almost exclusively with Nintendo on
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  sports titles, but before that, they also made
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Players can make a lot of comparisons between S
  <em>
   hining Force 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  beyond the character designs. In Japan, this game was released in three episodes between 1997 and 1998. Like
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  , data could be carried over between games. Unfortunately, North America only got the first episode in 1998, but thankfully for fans, there are fan patches out there for the other two scenarios. They are all worth it too, as hard but good tactical RPGs.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together
   </em>
  </strong>
  began as a tactical RPG on the SNES. This then made its Sega Saturn debut in 1996 in Japan, and the first time North America got a taste was 1998 for the PS1 version. A majority of the team at Quest Corporation helped create
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  for Squaresoft after this. That’s funny considering
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together
  </em>
  was released after
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  in North America by a few months, even though it officially came first.

 <p>
  This probably made some players think
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together
  </em>
  was the copycat instead of the prototype which made
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  a great game. There’s a political story, grid-based gameplay with a class system, and so many other familiar features. The best possible way to experience it now is through the remaster,
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre Reborn
  </em>
  , on consoles like the Switch. Make no mistake though, this is an absolute banger of an RPG on any console from the SNES to the Sega Saturn and beyond.

    Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO
   </em>
  </strong>
  promises to be one of the most content-rich
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games of all time. With that in mind, it's not too surprising that series fans want to start playing the game early, and the game's publisher Bandai Namco is more than happy to oblige.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed new skills and passives coming for all classes in Season 6. The new feature is part of a range of changes that
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  will make in the next season, such as progression updates, a new Elixir, enemies, and more.

 <p>
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players choose one of five classes to face the dangers of Sanctuary. To make their character more powerful, they get points to unlock active skills and passives, which translates into different builds. A popular example is the Whirlwind Barbarian build, which uses the Whirlwind active skill as its main damage source. With the upcoming season, Blizzard has shed light on an important change that this gameplay aspect will undergo.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  classes will receive five new passives, which are skills that will always remain active once they have been learned. For the Barbarian, the passives will be Belligerence, Heavy Hitter, Warpath, Irrepressible, and Barbed Carapace, while the Druid will receive Humanity, Catastrophe, Feral Aptitude, Backlash, and One with Nature. Necromancers will have the passives Necrotic Fortitude, Finality, Titan's Fall, Precision Decay, and Affliction. Rogue passives will be Target Practice, Crossbow, Evasive, Unto Dawn, and Alchemical Admixture, and Sorcerer passives will be Evocation, Energy Focus, Dampen Layer, Elemental Synergies, and Enlightenment.

 <p>
  While all five
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  classes will receive new active and passive skills, players will also see a variety of tweaks, which have the potential to make gameplay more engaging as players explore new ideas. Another major addition to Season 6 will be the debut of the Spiritborn, a new
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  class with its Unique items, Spirit Guardians, and a vast arsenal of skills to fight the dangers of the Nahantu jungle.

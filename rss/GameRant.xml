  <em>
   <strong>
    Fields of Mistria
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an RPG simulation title where players create the cozy farm of their dreams in a beautiful town filled with interesting people. Players have found themselves feeling incredibly nostalgic while playing
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  due to it reminding players of the past farming simulators such as
  <em>
   Harvest Moon
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In between tending to crops and animals, there are various villagers for the player to also get to know, with some residents of the village known as Mistria also being romanceable. Although
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  is currently in early access, which means players can't experience the entire romance of these villagers, players are already aware of the currently available options, though two more are likely to be added in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated April 14, 2025, by Megan Smith:
   </strong>
   Fields of Mistria romance is still yet to fully be added to the farming simulator, with the game still being in early access. However, the list of Field of Mistria romance options has increased recently, with players finally being able to meet Caldarus in person. Since this recent update, players can only talk to the dragon statues, but finally, they can meet this dragon man in person. Besides this, the Fields of Mistria romanceable characters have also received some extra attention, with players now being able to take their future beloved on a date during the Shooting Star Festival. While players may still not be able to fully commit themselves to a bachelor or bachelorette. This is every possible romance option in Fields of Mistria to allow a player to prepare for the future.

  Players who are looking for a caring person who will look after them in sickness and in health should look no further than Valen, the village doctor. Not only is she the person who tends to the players if they get hurt in the Mines, but she can also provide them with various boosters for a price to improve the progress the player can make in a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Above all else, Valen is an incredibly casual character to meet that makes not only a brilliant love interest but also a great friend, as she can be seen caring for all the villagers of Mistria and being a part of the fun on Fridays as she drinks with the others. There is also a secret side to Valen that players discover from her heart events, as she is shown to be creating medicine that seems to heal the townsfolk quickly. Players may learn more about this by befriending her.

  Some of the best romances in gaming are those that come together through having similar interests. Hayden and the player both own farms next to one another, which already gives them something to bond over. Hayden, from the start, shows himself to be a great neighbor who could be more, as he gifts the player a watering can and some seeds to get started on the farm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides his handsome figure, he proudly shows off his farmer's tan. Hayden, as to be expected of the animal merchant, loves animals so much, especially his prized chicken Henrietta. This fowl will be somewhat of a competition for the player, and not only during the Animal Festival, as Henrietta can be quite the jealous bird, yearning for Hayden's attention even when he is with friends.

  Players who enjoy the mysterious and possibly morally gray types should look no further than the bathhouse owner, Juniper. Alongside her slightly evil laugh, players will find themselves commonly being her experiment during her heart events as the player downs the various concoctions she makes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While she may have been pulled to Mistria due to its sudden surge of magic and monsters, a willing test subject that keeps coming back for more may be exactly what Juniper needs to convince her to stay. Like any good Witch character, finding the right gifts for Juniper can be quite peculiar, though she also has a weak spot for Pizza. Thankfully, a farmer can also gift her various potion ingredients that she will also appreciate, making the farmer seem like her accomplice.

  The majority of the villagers in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  are incredibly welcoming to the player. However, someone the player will struggle to win over is the blacksmith, March, who thinks the farmer has arrived to steal his thunder. Through plenty of beer, perfect ore, and sushi, a player can win over this stubborn, jealous blacksmith until he starts to catch feelings for the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players shouldn't expect romancing March to be easy, even if the best gifts for him are ones players can find while mining that he can use during his work. When March starts to fall in love, he can still be a little closed-off, suggesting that he doesn't care for the player, even if he really does. If a player is struggling to see the appeal of March, they should be sure to stop off at the inn on a Friday to see the joyous person he becomes when a little drunk. Through his heart events, March will also learn that the farmer's help is something he will come to enjoy.

  Going back to the nicer members of
  <em>
   Field of Mistria
  </em>
  , Reina is the perfect option for any foodie playing this RPG. As the head cook of the Sleeping Dragon Inn, Reina is in charge of cooking all the soups that players take a sip of every day, as well as producing the menu for the inn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reina understands that the best way to the player's heart is through their stomach, as each heart event shows Reina testing out new recipes for the inn to hopefully put Mistria back on the map. Reina then provides players with all sorts of delicious foods, though she will also expect such treatment in return as the best way to befriend and then eventually romance her is through providing her with her favorite foods.

  Another animal lover in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  is Ryis. While he might not own a farm like Hayden, Ryis shows his appreciation for animals, especially birds, by putting his carpentry skills to use by making a birdhouse with the help of the player. Making this birdhouse helps the player bond with Ryis while also learning a little more about him and what Mistria was like before the earthquake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside creating a birdhouse, Ryis and the player also help out the rest of Mistria through the main story quests, where they will commonly work together to put the town back on its feet. Ryis deserves the player's attention as he truly is one of the nicest souls in Fields of Mistria as well as just being one of the bachelors that seems to know everyone.

  Adeline is the individual who invites the player to the village of Mistria after an earthquake disrupts and destroys parts of the town. She and her brother have been left to manage the town while their parents have returned to the Capital. Although, even with this responsibility, she is one of the kindest individuals in the village for the player to meet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, this has caused the pink-haired woman a lot of stress, but thankfully, with the aid of this new farmer, the player can help her manage the paperwork and the rest of the village while also having an excuse to spend time together. Since she is acting as the leader of the town, players will also be talking to Adeline the most, which also makes her the natural option for anyone looking for a girlfriend that they have gotten close to.

  Balor was once a traveling merchant, and while he still considers himself to be one, Balor has somewhat made a home for himself in Mistria, though falling in love may see him staying there permanently. Balor tries to come off as the typical merchant who is simply looking for a profit, though it is proven through his heart events that this isn't the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the aftermath of the earthquakes, Balor has been lowering his prices for the village, though he doesn't enjoy people like the farmer trying to tell him he's a good person. Especially as he plans to leave once the village is back on its feet, though falling in love with him might see him decide otherwise. Since Balor was once a rogue, it's no surprise that he has managed to steal the hearts of many farmers that are currently enjoying
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , though perhaps it's time for Balor's heart to be stolen instead.

  Eiland is the brother of Adeline and is just as single as his sister, leaving him as another great option for romance in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.
  </em>
  While he might not have as many responsibilities as Adeline, Eiland has a deep love of history, which influenced him to become an archeologist, so even though he may be dressed quite fine, he can be found within the museum and near the mines, getting lost in the dirt looking for artifacts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides his love of discovering the past, players who have spoken to Eiland around town will also discover that he has quite a sweet tooth, which means any player who can bake a cake is sure to win over his heart. Eventually, players may even be able to help EIland make history for himself by starting a life with the farmer once Fields of Mistria leaves early access.

  There are plenty of other kind souls in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , with another sweet romance option from the bachelorettes being Celine. Since moving into her own place just outside the main village of Mistria, Celine has always been obsessed with planting flowers. Her garden is filled with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  When leaving their own farm, the player is sure to bump into Celine tending to her own garden, and through her heart events, the player will even help her cultivate a flower that was thought to be extinct. Above all else, Celine is one of the cutest romanceable characters in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria,
  </em>
  with a heart of gold. With how lovely Celine is, it's no surprise that she was chosen to be on the key art of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  as well as being one of the first people to welcome the farmer to the town.

  By progressing through
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , players will unlock even more romance options, with one surprisingly well-received addition being the dragon himself, Caldarus. When players first meet this ancient dragon, he is simply stuck as a statue due to him not having the power to return. He grants the player some of his power in the hopes of helping him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, players will progress the story far enough to finally meet this dragon man in person and look upon his human form. While players can gift Caldarus food or statues of himself, his heart can be easily gained through progressing the story, as well as being one of the characters a player has likely talked to most.

  It’s hard to be mad when playing through decades of beloved music in the franchise via
  <em>
   Theatrhythm Final Bar Line
  </em>
  . It’s the latest entry in the series, featuring a hybrid style of turn-based and rhythm-based gameplay, sporting a visual style like fans have never seen before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Form a party and choose what game soundtrack to dive into, from Sephiroth’s final theme in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  “One-Winged Angel” to the painful of the era metal song from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  “Otherworld.” It’s a feast for the ears, but maybe not so much for the eyes.

  <em>
   Chocobo Racing
  </em>
  was a PS1 spinoff featuring Chocobo and other monsters racing, akin to a
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  title. It took years, but a sequel was finally made:
  <em>
   Chocobo GP,
  </em>
  which had an admittedly rocky launch thanks to tons of in-game purchases. Thankfully, Square Enix loosened the monetary ties to the game and unlocked content.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current package now on Switch is full of great tracks, music, and characters with a vibrant art style. Some of the more surprising ones include Steiner and his knight-like car from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9,
  </em>
  as well as Terra in her rage mode riding Magitek Armor from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy
  </em>
  was a sequel on the surface, but it was more of an expanded re-release of the original game,
  <em>
   Dissidia Final Fantasy
  </em>
  on the PSP. The premise was simple: players got to pit the hero characters from the mainline games against their opposing villains in a
  <em>
   Power Stone
  </em>
  -like arena brawler complete with RPG elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Squall and Ultimecia appeared in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  , for example. Visually, the modern entry of
  <em>
   Dissidia Final Fantasy NT
  </em>
  is better, but
  <em>
   Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy
  </em>
  has more to love mechanically and there is a deep story for fans to appreciate.

  The enjoyment players got out of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
  </em>
  when it launched on the GameCube largely depended on whether fans had three other friends to play with. They also each needed link cables and GBAs, which made this game an expensive but unforgettable action-adventure experience like no other at the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition
  </em>
  , it’s now easier and cheaper to get a multiplayer session going. While not the deepest
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game, the simplistic gameplay of this spinoff was designed around having a good time with friends on the couch or now online.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  feels like a game from a forgotten era and a celebration of everything that made the franchise unique up to the year 2000. The visual style was colorful, and the world was brimming with life thanks to the colorful cast of heroes and NPCs. It was a living, breathing world that dared fans to come on an adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were plenty of grim moments, including themes of genocide, but they were presented in a manner that made it feel less devastating. That juxtaposition was kind of the point. A new generation of fans will be able to appreciate this adventurous entry if only the remake gets announced. For now, the remaster on modern consoles will more than suffice.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2
  </em>
  was the first direct sequel to a numbered game, and was just as dark thematically as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  was about Yuna going on a sacrificial pilgrimage to stop a giant whale-like monster from killing thousands, if not millions, of people. That’s not a fun concept to think about, let alone engage with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2
  </em>
  was a hard pivot, featuring Yuna in a bubblier mood and sporty outfit. It was a girl power-infused RPG with her cousin, Rikku, and newbie Paine along for the ride. It was dramatically sillier by comparison, which rubbed some the wrong way, but decades later, fans have come around to seeing how refreshing the world and mechanics are to engage with.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  was not just a celebration of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  that continued the remake process. Like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  , it was a celebration of the series that went all out for fans to create one memorable moment after the other. In some moments, Cloud wrestled with tragic memories; then, Red 13 disguised himself as a human soldier and danced like Michael Jackson.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are so many surprising moments in the game that a ten-hour podcast or deep dive video wouldn’t be long enough to discuss how upbeat and weird this game could be at times. Will these wacky antics continue into the third and final entry?

  If fans are looking for an underappreciated entry that does not have a dramatic story behind it, then
  <em>
   World of Final Fantasy
  </em>
  is the game. Players will jump into a crossover storybook universe with two twins who rub shoulders with classic characters like Cloud from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  and or Lightning from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 13
  </em>
  . Even though they still sport moody personalities, their designs make them more adorable than ever.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay is equally weird as players collect monsters
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -style and then stack them on their heads in turn-based combat. It’s a lot to explain, but overall, it’s a mechanically deep game presented as a chill love letter to fans everywhere. It deserves more love, and a sequel to boot.

 <p>
  The president of Nintendo of America, Doug Bowser, has weighed in on
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  's stance on using AI to create its games. As AI has become more popular, fans and developers alike have expressed both curiosity and concern regarding its rise, and now Nintendo has revealed some of its thoughts on the matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recent developments have led to a great deal of AI-generated content appearing on the web, for better or worse. AI's ability to do things like recreate elements like voices or create new images has led to concerns regarding how it might be used to take shortcuts, with worries of AI potentially slashing game jobs in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Nintendo's Doug Bowser has shared his and Nintendo's thoughts on the matter while speaking with CNBC. Bowser acknowledges that there's a lot of potential with AI, and that, internally, Nintendo is "discussing" how its tools might be able to help the company. However, Bowser says that it's the general belief at Nintendo that it's the developers and their artistry that make its games great, and that Nintendo as a whole has no intention of replacing its employees with AI. From the sound of it, there's a chance that Nintendo could end up utilizing AI in some way to navigate tedious tasks, but the developers aren't going anywhere.

  AI's Use in Gaming Has Already Sparked Controversy
 </h2>
 <p>
  While Nintendo's thoughts on AI seem to indicate that it will be limited in its use, if it's used at all, at least for the near future, other companies have already embraced what AI can do for them. However, it hasn't all been received well by the community. For example, there was a backlash when it was revealed that
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is using AI-generated assets. Players had suspected it for some time, with particular suspicion arising around certain skins and an odd six-fingered hand in an image that appeared during an event.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, another example is
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  has a built-in AI system that lets users do things like generate objects and textures by typing in information or using a picture. However, Krafton revealed early on that its AI system has been trained on "company-owned copyright issue-free" data, and the AI performs the task on the user's computer without contacting an external server. This helped to allay some fans' concerns, as players have not only been concerned about developers losing jobs, but also about the questionable nature of material other AI systems have been trained with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nintendo has regularly come up with unusual ideas for its consoles and games over the decades, and isn't afraid to experiment. However, for now, it sounds like Nintendo will continue to develop games the traditional way, with the expertise and creativity that skilled developers provide.

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077: Best Weapons For Netrunner Builds</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-best-netrunner-weapons/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Netrunning is a popular style of play for most professional players in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  , due to how it allows players to control the battlefield with a frenzy of quickhacks that can delete enemies from existence. Yet, sometimes, it’s fun to use weapons with Netrunner abilities rather than relying solely on quickahcks.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  While quickhacks will be the best and most efficient way to become a Netrunner, it’s nice to have weapons in case things go south, and these weapons will complement Netrunner builds in a variety of different ways for those looking to become a powerful V.

 <p>
  It’s not common for SMGs to take the center stage, especially with Netrunner builds, but there’s something so much fun about Buzzsaw. It’s a ripping and roaring competitor thanks to its extra damage to limbs, headshot multiplier, and great handling, but quickhacks make this weapon even better.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Ping quickhack, players will be able to see enemies through walls, which means the high-penetration rounds of Buzzsaw will allow players to rapidly fire their gun and pierce the enemies that dare try to hide from V’s wrath, providing an immensely powerful one-of-a-kind SMG.

 <p>
  Headhunter is a throwable knife that adds some variety to Netrunner builds, since it might not be the strongest weapon to slash with, but the true power lies within throwing this great weapon to synergise with swapped out guns, all while quickhacks are melting through the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Headhunter’s special modifier, players can mark enemies that have been hit with the knife, and attacking the enemy’s head with any weapon at all provides an additional 200% damage, along with a 150% damage multiplier, and will even return the Headhunter knife to players so that they can do it all over again.

    How to Get Genjiroh:
   </strong>
   During Play It Safe, head to Floor 21 and enter the code: 2906. Alternatively, find it at the Arasaka Estate in Act 3.

 <p>
  This Smart Pistol provides players with a necessary Smart Link weapon that can lock onto 4 enemies at once, and can also have a 4-round burst to ensure enemies hit with these seeking projectiles aren’t going to be able to withstand V’s power as a Netrunner, especially when each hit has a large chance to both induce Shock and deal Electrical damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smart Link is a great piece of cyberware to run, especially for Netrunners, and a weapon as light as Genjiroh will certainly benefit from this as players lock onto multiple enemies and take out the competition alongside varying quickhacks to topple an empire of gang members.

 <p>
  While there are plenty of quickhacks to use that can disable the cyberware of opponents, it’s also nice to have the option of an SMG that fires off potential EMPs with each impacting bullet. The Yinglong Smart Submachine Gun deals moderate damage for the gun type, but has a rapid attack speed, along with great lock-on time and electrical damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the Yinglong really shines is that these electrical bullets can provide an EMP on impact, disabling cyberware and really making the life of one of V’s attackers a living Hell, and far worse than what Night City already is.

  A powerful Netrunner will be able to set off an intense cyberware attack on clustered groups of enemies, and while this should kill them all, those who survive will wish they didn’t once V unsheathes Byakko. With this weapon, V can save some bullets and spend some stamina to dash, slash, and leap towards surviving enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Byakko’s iconic modifier, players can leap towards enemies with the katana equipped, and even grant themselves faster attack patterns with each kill, meaning that with a lethal cyber attack, V can take out the survivors with rapid and brutal ease.

    How to Get Erebus:
   </strong>
   Find the Crafting Spec during Somewhat Damaged.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If there’s any weapon that perfectly encapsulates the Netrunner’s dream, it's Erebus. This is a weapon that players can only get if they side with Solomon Reed in the Phantom Liberty expansion, and one that can be easily missed if players aren’t careful in the final mission, but it’s immensely worth it considering it’s an SMG that has a literal rogue AI from beyond the Blackwall inside it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Erebus has great damage to deal, and it even starts up its own lethal quickhacks without the Netrunner holding this gun having to do any of the heavy lifting, as low health enemies have more of a chance to be infected with the Blackwall Gateway quickhack when shot, ensuring that they scream in terror as their brains melt from their skulls.

  multiplayer into overdrive with the introduction of omnimovement, all-new modes like Kill Order, and a selection of unique Perks and Wildcards that add extra customization to player loadouts. In addition to these new features,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  also includes a roster of familiar weapons from the 90s, each carving out its own niche in the overall meta.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can choose from a wide range of weapons in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , from fast-firing Submachine Guns to powerful Sniper Rifles. While the choice of weapon ultimately comes down to personal preference, some are certainly better suited for specific situations than others. Here are all
  <strong>
   the best weapons in
   <em>
    Black Ops 6.

   <strong>
    Updated on April 13, 2025, by Nathan Round:
   </strong>
   The meta has shifted significantly in Black Ops 6, allowing some weapons to shine more than others. This list has been updated to include new weapons introduced with the launch of Season 3 for Black Ops 6, some of which have earned their place among the top weapons. It has also been updated to include additional launch weapons that now rank within the top 10 options in the game due to recent buffs and nerfs for Season 3, along with providing images showcasing the absolute best setups for each weapon.

  Kicking things off is arguably the most skill-dependent weapon on this list: the
  <strong>
   LW3A1 Frostline
  </strong>
  . While it isn’t the hardest-hitting Sniper Rifle, falling behind heavyweights like the LR 7.62 and HDR, it is by far the quickest. The LW3A1 Frostline is
  <strong>
   the fastest-handling Sniper Rifle
  </strong>
  currently available, letting players scope in significantly quicker than other options.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to damage, the LW3A1 Frostline still holds its own, consistently
  <strong>
   landing one-shot headshot kills at nearly all ranges
  </strong>
  and securing
  <strong>
   a one-shot chest kill up to 88.9 meters.
  </strong>
  Past that distance, it drops to a two-shot chest kill, making the Long Barrel a must-have attachment on larger, long-range maps.

  Following the PPSH-41 is the
  <strong>
   Kompakt 92
  </strong>
  , a weapon that is relatively slept on when it comes to the game's close-range meta. In terms of pure TTK (time-to-kill), the Kompakt 92 ranks as the
  <strong>
   number one Submachine Gun to use at the 10-meter mark
  </strong>
  , thanks to its
  <strong>
   blistering fire rate for high DPS.
  </strong>
  The Kompakt 92 is also decently fast, sporting an admirable ADS and sprint-to-fire speed that's relatively close to some of the other top Submachine Guns.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Kompakt 92 shines at shredding players up close and can even come in handy as a reliable secondary if players choose to run Overkill. However, though this weapon does shine at the 10-meter mark as mentioned earlier, its
  <strong>
   damage range quickly falls off
  </strong>
  beyond that point, drastically falling behind pretty much every other Submachine Gun at 16 meters and beyond.

  Next up is the
  <strong>
   KSV
  </strong>
  , a solid weapon that, while not necessarily ranking above others in its class, is an excellent choice for players seeking a reliable close-range option early in the game. As the second major SMG in its category, the KSV is best compared to the C9 in terms of overall stats. Between the two, the KSV offers a
  <strong>
   faster fire rate
  </strong>
  , resulting in a better time-to-kill (TTK) than most other options, along with slightly improved movement speed, though the difference in mobility is minor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The KSV also ranks among the best for aim-down-sight and sprint-to-fire speeds. While it may not reach the speeds of the Tanto .22 or Jackal PDW, it’s close to that of the C9. Where the KSV really excels, however, is in hip-fire accuracy, making it
  <strong>
   the most precise SMG for hip-firing
  </strong>
  in the game. Its only significant drawbacks are its low range, even for an SMG, and its noticeable horizontal recoil, which can cause the weapon to jump from left to right when fired.

  Though the superiority of the Submachine Gun category is fairly contested currently in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , the
  <strong>
   C9
  </strong>
  still manages to make its way into being one of the top weapons in the game. This is thanks to both its
  <strong>
   high handling and mobility attributes
  </strong>
  , which combo well with the game's movement system. Although not necessarily the fastest in the Submachine Gun category, it's still pretty reliable, making the C9 an excellent choice for players who like to stay on the move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though primarily built for close-range scenarios, the range of the C9 is also pretty solid, making the weapon
  <strong>
   exceptional even at medium range
  </strong>
  . The iron sights are also some of the cleanest in the game, eliminating the need to run an optic, thus freeing an attachment slot in the Gunsmith. Though all these attributes make the C9 an excellent weapon to use in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , there are other weapons in the same category that rank a little higher when it comes to TTK.

  Coming up next is the
  <strong>
   Krig C
  </strong>
  , one of two weapons to arrive for the Season 1 update of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6.
  </em>
  The Krig C is currently a top pick when it comes to ranked play, and while it has received a nerf to its recoil in the past, it still ranks relatively high. When it comes to overall time-to-kill, the Krig C
  <strong>
   narrowly beats the aforementioned Model L
  </strong>
  , thanks to its
  <strong>
   overall better damage output and faster fire rate.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Krig C is also
  <strong>
   relatively quick for an Assault Rifle as well
  </strong>
  —not exactly ranking as good as the AS VAL, but bridging the gap when it comes to mobility and sprint-to-fire speed. All these attributes make the Krig C one of the most versatile Assault Rifles players can pick—provided they are able to tone down the weapon's recoil by both using the best attachments and learning to control its recoil pattern.

  Entering the top three now is the
  <strong>
   Goblin Mk2
  </strong>
  , a semi-automatic Assault Rifle that may fly under most players' radar. However, despite other semi-automatic rifles struggling to impact the game's overall meta, the Goblin Mk2 stands out as
  <strong>
   the heaviest-hitting Assault Rifle
  </strong>
  currently available in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Multiplayer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Goblin Mk2
  <strong>
   averages a three-shot kill
  </strong>
  from most distances while boasting a decent fire rate for high DPS. Its damage range is also quite impressive, offering
  <strong>
   the best combinational time-to-kill
  </strong>
  (TTK) among all Assault Rifles—effective all the way up to 37 meters. Of course, being semi-automatic, the weapon requires precision and accuracy to be used effectively.

  The
  <strong>
   AS VAL
  </strong>
  may be the best Assault Rifle available in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , leading with
  <strong>
   exceptional handling and impressive mobility
  </strong>
  , allowing players to zip across the battlefield in style. Additionally, the AS VAL
  <strong>
   boasts a high fire rate and great damage
  </strong>
  , making it ideal for quickly taking down opponents up close. Although its range is on the lower side, which falls off considerably at 35 meters, this doesn’t limit its versatility much in Multiplayer, as the hitscan range on most weapons falls to around the 20-meter range.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another unique benefit of the AS VAL is its
  <strong>
   built-in suppressor
  </strong>
  , providing a stealthy loadout without needing a muzzle attachment. Combined with its speed, this makes the AS VAL a
  <strong>
   strong contender for the close-range meta
  </strong>
  — one capable of holding its own against Submachine Guns rather well. The only significant drawback is its default 20-round magazine, though this can be easily addressed with an extended magazine.

  Cracking into the top three is the
  <strong>
   CR-56 AMAX
  </strong>
  , one of three
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  weapons making their debut in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 3. In its base form, the CR-56 AMAX stands out as
  <strong>
   one of the hardest-hitting Assault Rifles
  </strong>
  currently available, boasting impressive damage per shot. While it might not be the absolute fastest-killing rifle in its class, it comes pretty close.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where the CR-56 AMAX truly shines is in its ease of use,
  <strong>
   featuring minimal recoil and weapon kick
  </strong>
  , making it easy to stay locked on target at both close and long ranges. Thanks to its combination of great damage output and excellent accuracy, the CR-56 AMAX proves to be a true jack-of-all-trades option in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Multiplayer, suited for just about any engagement range—a perfect addition to any player's loadout.

  When it comes to sheer firepower, the
  <strong>
   AK-74
  </strong>
  is the top option for the Assault Rifle category in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Multiplayer. Though this Assault Rifle does sport a decent amount of side-to-side recoil, which can throw some players off at range, the AK-74
  <strong>
   boasts an excellent time-to-kill
  </strong>
  (TTK). However, when it comes to both mobility and handling, the AK-74 is lacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the slower nature of the AK-74 may be a problem for some, boosting its handling attributes with the right attachments is not too difficult, and the side-to-side recoil can also be managed pretty effectively. As a result, players are given a pretty solid Assault Rifle, one that is
  <strong>
   devastating at medium range
  </strong>
  .

  Taking the number one spot is the
  <strong>
   Grau 5.56
  </strong>
  , another iconic weapon returning from
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  . While technically not a standalone weapon—serving instead as a conversion kit for the SWAT 5.56 Marksman Rifle—the Grau 5.56 is currently
  <strong>
   one of the fastest-killing full-auto ranged options
  </strong>
  across nearly all engagement distances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Grau 5.56 outperforms the AK-74
  </strong>
  in almost every situation, matching it in body shot damage but surpassing it in both headshot damage and fire rate, making it the faster killing choice. While it does feature some horizontal recoil, it's
  <strong>
   fairly manageable and easy to control
  </strong>
  , cementing the Grau 5.56 as one of the best all-around weapons to run with in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Multiplayer.

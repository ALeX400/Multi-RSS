      <title>8 Best Open-World Games That Have Almost No RPG Mechanics, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  The RPG genre has become so mainstream that most AAA games feature some role-playing elements to let players enjoy a palpable sense of progression. This applies to most
  <strong>
   open-world
  </strong>
  games, turning into action RPGs that are certainly fun to play in their own right.

 <p>
  However, some players prefer open-world games that don't strive to be too complex. As long as the basics are sound, the lack of RPG mechanics in these sandbox titles shouldn't perturb too many fans.

  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  is one of the best story-driven video games players can check out. The open world of this title is beautiful, even if it lacks the interactivity that most people expect from a game in this genre.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Definitive Edition
  </em>
  is the best way to enjoy a title, especially since the original game has aged in ways that some fans may not be able to adjust to. Tommy Angelo's rise as a member of the Salieri crime family is a tantalizing tale that will keep fans coming back for more.

  The beauty of
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's campaign stems from its willingness to change and entice new fans. The simplest way to do this was by integrating an open world and a grappling hook to let Master Chief explore Zeta Halo in style.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking out enemies and using the grappling hook to make combat dynamic is more than enough to play a competent
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  campaign. The lack of RPG elements won't be a huge deal for anyone who wants to enjoy this game's sci-fi FPS trappings without being distracted by other elements.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  was a huge jump when compared to its predecessors, letting players witness a new and improved version of Liberty City that has become iconic. It helps that Niko Bellic is an engrossing protagonist who interacts with the seedy underbelly of this city to rake in a ton of cash.
 </p>
 <p>
  The narrative of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 4
  </em>
  is one of the very best seen in a Rockstar game, with the title featuring two different endings based on a critical decision. This may be seen as a way to add role-playing elements to the game, but there's no other example of RPG gameplay present in this iconic open-world game.

  What made
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  such a huge hit was its willingness to let fans employ a ton of creativity to craft powerful gear, create giant structures, and survive against all odds in a world that turns especially hostile at night. With all these gameplay loops, it's easy to see why the lack of RPG elements didn't faze many players.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is a game that doesn't take too long to understand, with players slowly figuring out the optimal path to reach the Ender Dragon and enjoy the end credits. After this is achieved, players can either check out the massive amount of content in most game servers or try to create something impressive that will take many hours but is well worth the effort.

  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is an excellent open-world game that marks the final chapter in Bruce Wayne's nightly adventures. Controlling the Batmobile was divisive but added a new layer to the gameplay as players explored Gotham City in its entirety to beat on the bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealing the identity of the main villain and encountering a slew of interesting bosses in
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is a huge part of what makes the series so special. The interactions with the Joker are a bonus and ensure that players won't notice the lack of RPG elements in a game that doesn't need them, outside of a few health upgrades.

  One of the greatest Rockstar Games ever made,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is one of the best open-world video games that fans can check out. It shows the developer's mastery over this genre, crafting a compelling experience with little to no RPG elements to speak of.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, what helps this game stand out is a beautiful world, memorable characters, and the best narrative ever told in a Rockstar game. Players who are iffy about controlling Arthur Morgan instead of John Marston will be singing a different tune after spending hours with this well-written character.

  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  is one of the most unique open-world games ever made, bucking almost every trend in the genre. The landscapes are massive but barren and players will only fight sixteen enemies throughout the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story takes a while to get going but will leave fans enraptured once they see the true nature of Wander's actions. There are no role-playing elements in this title, given that it would detract from the game's minimalist approach as players take out these colossi and revive Wander's love.

  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  is one of the best open-world games ever made, serving as a massive improvement from its predecessor on almost every front barring innovation. The new powers Link has access to are a blast to use, turning this title into a Nintendo-fied
  <em>
   Garry's Mod
  </em>
  as players construct robust structures that aid them in combat, traversal, or both.
 </p>
 <p>
  The focus on unique dungeons and memorable boss fights helps
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  establish itself as a near-perfect sequel that fans should get their hands on. The game experiments with many gameplay pillars, to the point where some people will be glad that they don't have to interact with RPG mechanics too on top of this.

   Strategy games

  were once practically non-existent in the console market, save for notable exceptions and ill-fated attempts (such as
  <em>
   Starcraft’s
  </em>
  remarkably awkward landing on the Nintendo 64). However, over the years, several titles have emerged to deliver their micro-management goodness to living room accessible formats — particularly when it comes to the Xbox line of consoles.

  One of the most surprising success stories of 2024,
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  is a card-based roguelike executed to near perfection. Its presentation might suggest an adherence to Poker, but LocalThunk did a great job of distilling a few of its tenets into crafting an accessible game that can be enjoyed by players who have never even contemplated picking up real-life cards. The best strategy roguelikes typically blend simple core mechanics with depth in choice and consequence, and
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  serves as a prime example of how to balance this execution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players must try to achieve a high enough score to complete a blind, allowing them to move on to a big blind and eventually a boss blind. Within a limited number of turns, players must discard and pull cards that allow them to build a hand that can pass the score threshold. In between matches, players can open booster packs containing different types of cards (which come in many forms, types, and Jokers) as they try to build the ultimate deck that can pave the way to glory in harder antes.

  <em>
   Two Crowns

 </p>
 <p>
  Money pretty much makes this world go round, and players' actions and survival are specifically tied to their resources. Permadeath is part of the equation too, so if a ruler ends up without their gold and crown, they will be put to rest. After that, a successor steps up to the plate. While a fantastic single-player experience,
  <em>
   Kingdom Two Crowns
  </em>
  ' most exciting aspect is co-op support, which makes sense considering the title. Two players are cast as different rulers, and they are mostly allowed to do their own thing rather than be tied to each other.

  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  is no stranger to video games, most of which tend to go down the FPS or horror route. While real-time tactics might not seem like the most obvious direction,
  <em>
   Aliens: Dark Descent
  </em>
  does a surprisingly good job of capturing the classic movies' tension, particularly the 1986 sequel. Taking inspiration from
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  , Tindalos put together a project that streamlines RTS mechanics while incorporating some horror elements like the use of a stress meter that gradually causes the colonial marines to develop psychological trauma during missions. Like
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  , permadeath is part of the equation, so there is always a risk that a mission will go wrong and result in the death of valuable squad members.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dark Descent
  </em>
  does not necessarily explore too many novel concepts, but it blends a myriad of well-worn ideas to create an enjoyable whole that should hit the mark with RTS fans who do not care about
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  fans who are not familiar with the tactics genre. While quite punishing, the gameplay is somewhat simplified as players control the full squad rather than individual marines, removing some of the more minute control that tends to be a pretty big part of the genre's releases.

  After spending more than a year as a PC exclusive,
  <em>
   Age of Empires 4
  </em>
  made its way to Xbox consoles in August 2023. Relic and World's Edge's project garnered a primarily positive reception upon launch, with many regarding it as a safe but polished continuation of arguably the most beloved and popular RTS franchise of all time. Launching with four campaigns and eight civilizations (although two more were added later on),
  <em>
   AoE 4
  </em>
  offers a great deal of content for solo players, along with containing an active and robust multiplayer scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  Xbox owners have two
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  at their disposal, while PC Game Pass subscribers can play through the entire series thanks to the inclusion of the original trilogy's definitive edition. All four games are fantastic by most metrics, and an argument could certainly be made that
  <em>
   AoE 2
  </em>
  is the best RTS game of all time. However, newcomers should start with
  <em>
   AoE 4
  </em>
  , especially if they plan to try their hand at multiplayer.

  An
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  spin-off,
  <em>
   Age of Mythology
  </em>
  takes the core gameplay loop of the main series and adds gods to the mix, blending staple RTS realism with devastating enemy-destroying attacks. Although a relative footnote in
  <em>
   AoE
  </em>
  's legacy, the 2002 original is considered a cult classic in its own right, and the lack of a sequel was always disappointing. Fortunately, in 2024,
  <em>
   Age of Mythology
  </em>
  received a much-needed facelift in the form of
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  , an update that walks the line between remaster and remake.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   AoM: Retold
  </em>
  allows players to pick from four pantheons, along with an array of deities associated with each. They can then work their way through a fairly long single-player campaign that highlights the many differences of each civilization, all of which come with unique units and specializations.
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  does an admirable job of preserving the original version's charm while incorporating enough modern touches to ensure the gameplay does not feel too archaic.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Age of Empires 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  are arguably better-rounded games,
  <em>
   Age of Mythology: Retold
  </em>
  is a charming side quest that has enough fresh ideas to feel like its own entity rather than just a reskin.

  <em>

  <em>
   Halo Wars

  takes the series in a new direction in terms of genre. Players are treated to grand-scale skirmishes involving factions from the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  universe in a highly approachable RTS title. Since the game was made specifically for the Xbox 360, it features one of the most comfortable controller configurations for an RTS on a console. The story takes place before the events of the first
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  game, detailing what happened to the UNSC crew of the Spirit of Fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Halo Wars 2
  </em>
  is also available on Xbox Game Pass and serves as a fine continuation of its predecessor. In some ways, the sequel is superior to the first game, although it is certainly designed with non-RTS fans in mind. Therefore, people who want to spend more time in this universe but are reluctant to jump into a genre they are not familiar with can rest easy in knowing that
  <em>
   Halo Wars 2

  is for them.

  A new Capcom IP is always a cause for celebration, particularly one as unique as
  <em>
   Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
  </em>
  . Before its debut, the project was somewhat hard to pin down in terms of genre, seemingly blending strategy, hack and slash combat, and village management; in practice, the game mostly fits these categories, although it is best described as a real-time strategy tower defense title. Regardless,
  <em>
   Kunitsu-Gami
  </em>
  has a lot to offer for different audiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before diving into the strategy component, let's give a quick rundown of the campaign's structure. Charged with protecting the divine maiden as she purges evil spirits from a mountain, Soh spends his days saving villagers and exploring, all in preparation for a nightly onslaught. During the latter, Soh becomes something of an army leader in charge of placing the saved villagers as strategic points to ensure the maiden's safety. The "soldiers" have roles they excel in and can be upgraded, making for fun management and progression systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Kunitsu-Gami
  </em>
  's strategy gameplay mostly arrives through the villager management aspect. While Soh is a capable fighter, he cannot be everywhere at once, and he will need to use all his human resources well to keep the spirits at bay.

 <p>
  A sandbox RPG with turn-based combat and player-driven gameplay,
  <em>
   Wartales
  </em>
  combines popular concepts to create something fresh and, more importantly, niche. Depending on the person, the lack of a main story could either be enticing or off-putting, and their reaction is likely to determine if they will fall in love with Shiro Games' project or not. That said, if the idea of leading a ragtag group of mercenaries across a medieval-style world in search of contracts, food, and success sounds fun, then they should give
  <em>
   Wartales
  </em>
  a go, regardless of whether they generally prefer to follow a standard questline structure. And, to be clear, the campaign tells plenty of small-scale stories while allowing room for players to craft tales that are solely their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Wartales
  </em>
  is complicated. In an expansive and visually impressive sandbox, players lead 12 characters with traits, skills, and professions on a directionless journey beyond their need to make a living and survive. The latter is literal too, and the mercenaries must be kept fed, clothed, and paid; after all, they are people with needs and wants. The "strategy" and "tactical" elements are most apparent in the grid-based combat system, which shares similarities with the likes of
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin
  </em>
  . Most contracts/quests involve a combat scenario, and these battles tend to be quite difficult and could result in the death of the player's party members (if they die, they are gone). Furthermore, the game also complements the strategy genre by constantly requiring players to make tough and occasionally hopeless decisions.

  <em>
   Metal Slug
  </em>
  's return has been long sought-after, but a turn-based tactics spin-off was probably not on too many people's cards. Beloved in arcades, the franchise has crafted some of the most decorated run and gun shooters of all time, games that tend to focus on fast-paced and relentless action above everything else. On the surface, that mantra does not seem like a great fit for a grid-based isometric tactics game that prioritizes slow-paced planning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet,
  <em>
   Metal Slug Tactics
  </em>
  works pretty darn well, not only in terms of mechanics but also in its implementation of some IP staples. Despite being so widely different at its core, this release still fits into the
  <em>
   Metal Slug
  </em>
  universe, largely due to incorporating a similar aesthetic and tone. Utilizing a roguelike formula, the campaign is designed around short bursts rather than one extensive adventure, with players having to start fresh if their three chosen characters all fall.

  Game Pass Ultimate's PC version has some
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper
  </em>
  representation thanks to EA Play, but that won't mean much to players who only have access to Xbox. Despite its legacy,
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper
  </em>
  looks set to remain a thing of the past as EA has shown little interest in revisiting the franchise; consequently, fans must look elsewhere to get their fill of evil. The most obvious spiritual successor is the
  <em>
   Dungeons
  </em>
  series, which has produced a couple of cult favorites that have not really broken into the mainstream consciousness. The 2023 entry did not change that, but it is a fine and charming game that should keep someone busy for a couple of weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The concept is simple: world domination requires building an army and demolishing heroes.
  <em>
   Dungeons 4
  </em>
  understands that the fun parts of these games are the base building, unit development, and all-out wars, so the campaign emphasizes these elements as much as possible. The result is an efficient project that does not waste a lot of time, despite featuring a fairly lengthy campaign. The performance can struggle at times, and some of the story's later missions do threaten to get repetitive, but the overall experience is a positive one. Multiplayer is also an option for those who want to test out their strategic master plans against non-AI opponents.

  Taking a break from its
  <em>
   Endless
  </em>
  franchise, Amplitude Studios created
  <em>
   Humankind
  </em>
  , an ambitious 4X strategy game that allows players to work their way through seven eras. Starting out as nomadic tribes, players will gradually roam unclaimed land as they find food, survive, and slowly start to set the groundwork for a civilization. Eventually, they can move over to the Ancient Era, which is where the campaign opens up through the introduction of Cultures.
  <em>
   Humankind
  </em>
  's scope is incredible and flexible, granting users quite a lot of freedom in how they want to lead their civilizations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Incorporating diplomacy, religion, and even turn-based combat, Amplitude cast a wide net as it sought to cover as many preferences and play styles as possible. Surprisingly, most of the game's mechanics and ideas are fleshed out well, making most avenues for growth viable.
  <em>
   Humankind
  </em>
  can be overwhelming at times, but it is not a bad option for 4X beginners. The game is available on PC and Xbox.

  Similar to its predecessor,
  <em>
   Warband
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
  </em>
  combines a few different genres to create a package with no direct peers in the gaming landscape, despite sharing similarities with many prominent names. Set in Calradia, players are dropped in a world defined by battle as they set out to leave their mark on history. From humble beginnings, players will steadily amass an army en route to conquering towns and villages, with the end goal being to dominate the whole map.
 </p>
 <p>
  During physical conflicts, players can join their soldiers on the field, engaging in epic wars that are chaotic, bloody, and irresistibly fun. Outside the battlefield,
  <em>
   Bannerlord
  </em>
  opens up a range of management and strategy options that will dictate the player's growth, reputation, and presence. Due to casting a wide net,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2
  </em>
  is not the deepest
  <strong>
   strategy game on Game Pass
  </strong>
  , but it is ambitious and addictive.

  A popular deck-builder,
  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  's roguelike structure has allowed the game to maintain its relevancy. Players pick a character and receive a deck along with a unique power in the form of a relic. From there, they enter the spire, a tower consisting of multiple levels filled with enemy encounters and culminating in a boss fight. Along the way, players unlock new cards in the form of loot.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  constantly reshuffles the player's deck as they receive a fresh batch for every turn, along with a few energy cards that determine how many actions they can turn. Along with eradicating their opponents, players must also develop a strategy on how to counter the enemies' revealed moves.

  Sticking to the same subgenre for the time being,
  <em>
   Wildfrost
  </em>
  is another great Game Pass option for people craving a roguelike deck-builder that emphasizes player choice, all the while incorporating quite a bit of luck into the equation. Each run starts with players being handed a leader and a companion (they get a choice for the former, although the options are randomized), and then they set off to defeat enemies, collect more cards, overcome a zone's boss, and eventually defeat the final big bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Wildfrost
  </em>
  blends cute cards and a lively presentation with challenging combat that requires players to constantly consider the full picture and try to think ahead. This is 100% a pure strategy game that pulls no punches and lays the smackdown on any significant mistakes made by players. The result is a roguelike that is divisive but worth a try if someone is generally into deck-builders.

  Despite its reputation for being a gritty third-person, cover-based shooter, the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  series is set in an engrossing world, and the games usually feature gripping narratives. So, even though
  <em>
   Gears Tactics
  </em>
  took the turn-based-strategy route, it is a thoroughly entertaining title thanks to the universe it is set in and the lore it provides.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Gears Tactics
  </em>
  is a prequel to the first
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  game, but it also connects to plot points seen in later titles in the series, such as
  <em>
   Gears of War 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gears 5
  </em>
  . The top-down perspective suits the narrative well, as COG soldiers are deployed across a map, eliminating Locust enemies and clearing out objectives.

  <em>

  is not for everyone. The obvious target audience should be
  <em>
   Minecraft

  fans, but to be honest, the spin-off does not share enough in common with the main entry to warrant a recommendation solely on its title. That said, if someone wants to experience a different take on the Overworld,
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  is worth considering. As a strategy game, this 2023 release is very stripped down, to the point of being way too simplistic for die-hard fans of the genre. That's not to say they might not get some enjoyment out of the game's blend of exploration, combat, base upgrading, and team management, but they are unlikely to be too impressed by its strategic gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Minecraft Legends
  </em>
  is for young players who are familiar with the IP and are taking their first steps into strategy territory. As an introductory course that wraps the commonly overwhelming genre in an accessible skin,
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  does its job. Not every game needs to be complex or even innovative; sometimes, a simple but fun project is enough.

  Unsurprisingly,
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass for PC
  </strong>
  has a far more robust selection of strategy games. The genre has historically flourished on computers, with the mouse + keyboard setup complementing the pinpoint controls required by these titles. While console owners only have a small selection of games to pick from, the PC scene is considerably more impressive.

  For those with Xbox Game Pass for PC, here are a handful of the

  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  has not received a new game in more than 5 years, but it is still by far the definitive sci-fi real-time strategy franchise. The 1998 original was incredibly influential, and it was followed up by a belated 2010 sequel that produced multiple campaign expansions and continues to be played regularly more than a decade after its introduction.
 </p>
 <p>
  While aspects of the original title are dated,
  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  's 2017 remaster incorporates more than enough modern touches to make the game an easy recommendation in the mid-2020s.
  <em>
   StarCraft 2
  </em>
  is arguably even better, and it comes packed with enough content to keep somebody busy for months.

  11 Bit Studios created something special with
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  , a survival city-builder strategy hybrid that somehow shines in all three genres. A sequel was only a matter of time, and there was a slight worry that the next project would lack its predecessor's freshness. Fortunately,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  shines entirely on its own, offering a fantastic evolution that is different enough at its core to not render the first game obsolete. In fact,
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  is still on Game Pass and well worth a playthrough, regardless of its successor's existence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again, players find themselves leading a city, New London, during a hellish era defined by harsh weather, and they will need to constantly make choices that have notable benefits and consequences, both for themselves and especially for their citizens.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is a deep city-builder that uses a grid system to allow Stewards to stitch together districts, carving a "utopia" that is efficient enough to survive, even if not necessarily prosper. This time around, players will be venturing away from their city's walls, heading out on expeditions in search of resources and new locations. The sequel emphasizes its faction system as well, which means there will always be groups with different goals pushing their agendas on the player. Keeping everybody happy is nearly impossible, so tough decisions need to be made.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newcomers and veterans should start with
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  's story since it works well as a tutorial, along with just being pretty fun. After that, Utopia Builder will be the next step, and it provides plenty of replay value.

  Although not garnering as much attention as a few other late-2023 releases,
  <em>
   Against the Storm
  </em>
  was among the year's best projects across a plethora of genres and subgenres. If someone is into city-builders, strategy titles, or even roguelites, they need to try this game as it might scratch a hard-to-reach itch. Set in a fantasy world that looks pretty but is extremely dangerous due to storms that periodically destroy everything outside the main city, players are tasked by their queen to gradually explore the unknown and find a solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  This process involves establishing settlements that can dig deeper into the woods, and each mini-village has an expiry date; consequently, players have to make regular smart decisions if they want to progress and satisfy their ruler. By randomizing quite a few key elements,
  <em>
   Against the Storm
  </em>
  makes unpredictability one of its cornerstones, ensuring players cannot simply rely on a winning formula to get them through each situation. As with most city-builders, players are in charge of workers who need to be kept happy, something that is easier said than done.

  Although not carrying the same name recognition as
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Rise of Nations
  </em>
  is still highly regarded within the strategy gaming sphere. The 2003 original features nations from across human history, and they can all be played within any of the game's eras. Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Rise of Nations
  </em>
  is more economy-driven than most of its contemporaries, with the focus being on expanding a nation's territory through sustainable growth rather than just overwhelming enemies via brute strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like many of these titles,
  <em>
   Rise of Nation
  </em>
  's multiplayer was its main selling point. Nowadays, lobbies are not particularly active; however, the game also includes an extensive single-player campaign as well, one that is more than good enough to justify a recommendation. The
  <em>
   Extended Edition
  </em>
  also contains the Thrones and Patriots expansion pack, which is fantastic and some might argue even superior to the base game.

  Bullfrog Productions' time in the sun came to an end in 2001. While the company's run was fairly short-lived in the grand scheme of things, projects like
  <em>
   Populous
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Theme Park World
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper
  </em>
  ensured Bullfrog would not be forgotten anytime soon, particularly by strategy and management fans. Out of all those licenses,
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper
  </em>
  and its sequel are probably the most fondly remembered, although
  <em>
   Populous
  </em>
  ' influence on the God game genre cannot be understated either. Through EA Play, PC Game Pass subscribers can play a few of Bullfrog's masterpieces, specifically both
  <em>
   Populous
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper
  </em>
  games. All four titles are worth checking out, and while they might seem antiquated through a modern lens, the games are still quite a bit of fun to play.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dungeon Keeper 2
  </em>
  is slightly divisive as it swapped its predecessor's 2D visuals for 3D, a change that dates the sequel more than its predecessor. However, fundamentally, it is still the same experience as its decorated ancestor. Cast as an overlord, players are put in charge of a dungeon as they lay out traps to capture heroes trying to sneak in. The goal is to expand the dungeon's size and achieve world domination. Fairly challenging, the strategy game has a lengthy single-player campaign that is more than capable of keeping something entertained for a few weeks.

  In 1995, Westwood Studios released
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn
  </em>
  , changing the real-time strategy genre for the better. The series went on to produce a couple of fantastic sequels such as
  <em>
   Red Alert, Tiberian Sun
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Red Alert 2
  </em>
  , before fading into nothingness during the 2010s. Nowadays, EA seems happy to leave the license untouched, with the only PC entry of the last five years being a compilation package containing revamped versions of
  <em>
   Tiberian Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Red Alert
  </em>
  . This iconic franchise deserves better, although that has nothing to do with the quality of the
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Developed by Petroglyph Games, who have ties to Westwood, the 2020 release serves as a love letter to the franchise's glory days and comes packed with three expansions and a range of bonus content. At their hearts, these are still the same games that defined the '90s, but Petroglyph still implemented a wide range of changes to ensure they are accessible to both a modern and nostalgic audience. While the presentation can seem a bit simplistic compared to contemporary strategy games,
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer
  </em>
  's core mechanics are still rock solid, and they are enhanced by charming writing.

  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A

  <em>
   Legends Z-A

  Legends: Z-A's Starter Pokemon Haven't Received a Warm Welcome
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  has officially revealed that its starter trio will be Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita. There is a lot to unpack regarding the community's response to this reveal, but the initial reception was both swift and harsh. Big reveals like this always receive some level of backlash, but there's no doubt that
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  is receiving it on a different scale than ever before. Previous generations usually have one starter that takes the bulk of the backlash, while
  <em>
   Z-A
  </em>
  's entire trio has a hard time escaping the vitriol.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among the reasons players may feel dissatisfied by these starters, it's hard to imagine speculation didn't play a part in it. After months of rumors, it seems likely that some fans built up excitement over one choice and were disappointed to see the game go with another. Likewise, it certainly doesn't help that Totodile and Chikorita are both from the Johto Region, which plainly damages the diversity of the trio.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  faces an even bigger problem at the center of this controversy. Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita all have their own fans, but very few players appear to have fond memories of more than one, let alone all three of them. To further understand why this decision has struck a chord, it's best to look at how the game's predecessor got it right.

  This is a stark contrast from the starters in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , and may even hint at a different strategy at play.
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  featured Cyndaquil, Oshawott, and Rowlet as its starter trio. All three of these Pokemon have pretty massive fan bases behind them, and it's almost more difficult to find someone who doesn't like them.
 </p>
 <p>
  In additional contrast to the new lineup,
  <em>
   Arceus
  </em>
  ' trio was more diverse, with all three of them hailing from different regions. At the end of the day, these were popular Pokemon that people were excited to see. It was satisfying to see them receive new regional forms, with some of these Hisui redesigns even becoming as beloved as their counterparts. With this in mind, one does have to wonder if the unpopularity of
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter Pokemon is actually the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps developers wanted to give a second chance to Pokemon that are less popular and less viable. Furthermore,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  seems just as likely to give each member of the upcoming trio a new Mega Evolution as it would be to give them new regional forms. Doing either may rehabilitate them for more skeptical players, while those who already love them can be happy they're finally being catered to. Whatever the case, there is still plenty of time to salvage these Pokemon with whatever redesign they may wind up with. When it comes to the starter Pokemon available, hopefully
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  simply got off on the wrong foot.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed important details about two characters expected to arrive in the upcoming months, Hyacine and Cipher. Since its release,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has followed a pattern of introducing two playable five-star units in each update. This allows players to pull for a new character in every banner cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.1 features two characters, Tribbie and Mydei. Tribbie is part of the current banner cycle, while Mydei is scheduled to arrive in the second phase of this update, which is expected to launch on March 19. Although update 3.1 is not even halfway through, new leaks have already started hinting at characters set to debut in Version 3.3.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a credible
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  leaker named Luna, update 3.3 will feature two new five-star characters, Hyacine and Cipher. The leaker also revealed that Hyacine will be a Wind character who follows
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's recently introduced Path of Remembrance. This suggests that Hyacine's kit could involve using summons, which is common for Remembrance characters. The post also stated that she will be a "Burning HP Healer" who apparently relies on or has high SPD. The second character, Cipher, is expected to be a Quantum Nihility character, meaning her kit should focus on applying debuffs in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . Cipher's DPS potential will reportedly scale mostly off CRIT Damage.

  Both of these characters have been mentioned in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's main storyline. Hyacine is currently an NPC located in the Eternal Holy City Okhema. She is one of the Chrysos Heirs, a group of characters born of golden blood after the Titans of the Eternal Land fell. She is also known as the head nurse at the Twilight Courtyard and the assistant teacher of the Nousporists at the Grove of Epiphany, one of the major cities on Amphoreus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Hyacine, Cipher has yet to make an official appearance in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , but she has been mentioned in the main storyline. Like Hyacine, Cipher is also a Chrysos Heir, but she is a demigod possessing the Coreflame of Trickery as well. Despite being born of golden blood, Cipher abandoned her duties and left Okhema to live a separate life of mischief and scheming.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although leaks about character paths in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  are often accurate, players should wait for the next beta to confirm more details about these two characters. Based on HoYoverse's usual update schedule,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.3 is expected to arrive around April 23.

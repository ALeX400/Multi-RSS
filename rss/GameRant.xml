  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  presents players with a lot of decisions to make. Many of these decisions are incredibly challenging, as the results can lead to devastating consequences. Others are more playful, leading to building bonds with companions. One decision players who opted for a Rogue protagonist will have to make is what Specialization type they'd like to be.

 <p>
  The Saboteur Specialization is closely associated with the Lords of Fortune and focuses on explosive attacks. If players choose this option, they'll want weapons that capitalize on dealing immense physical damage. This Rogue Specialization will use all three weapons to destroy their enemies, making it crucial to find the best weapons.

 <p>
  Weisshaupt's Wail is a great option for an early Saboteur build. Players will want a sword that packs a powerful punch to deal the most damage possible. As this weapon is enhanced by finding additional copies, players will gain better perks, including the ability to Rally Party with Final attacks.

 <p>
  This blade can be purchased for 450 Gold from the Grey Warden Faction Vendor. Players should regularly upgrade this weapon at the Caretaker's Workshop and enchant it with 10% Weapon Damage to cause the most damage possible against their enemies.

 <p>
  The Barbed Longsword is an offhand weapon that's great for staggering enemies. Even as an uncommon weapon, it increases the duration of stagger by 25%, making it highly effective in hectic battles. To make it even more effective, players can enchant it with the 25% Stagger Enchantment.

 <p>
  Because of all the extra Stagger, this weapon is highly versatile and can be used in both early and late-game Saboteur builds. It pairs well with high-damage-inducing main-hand weapons. Players can obtain this weapon from a chest in the Temple Courtyard in Dock Town.

 <p>
  The Azure Bow is a solid choice for the Saboteur as it offers enhanced Hipfire damage. For players always on the move, this is a must-have perk. Players can boost this effect by adding the +20% Hipfire Damage Enchantment. While this Bow can be found relatively early on, it's a great option for the endgame.

 <p>
  Another benefit of this weapon is the increased Arrow capacity. Not only that, once the Bow reaches Legendary rarity, its damage increases based on that Arrow capacity, making it even more powerful. Players can find the Azure Bow in a chest in the Warden's Vault.

 <p>
  Inflicting the most damage possible is essential for a Saboteur to survive their battles. One way to do this is by inflicting Bleeding. Keen with a Twist is a Saber that inflicts high physical damage and decent Stagger. When its rarity is increased, it also inflicts Bleeding, making it a highly effective main-hand weapon.

 <p>
  This weapon can be obtained in a Floating Archive Temple chest or purchased from the Lords of Fortune Faction Vendor for 350 Gold once the shop reaches level 3. Players can get even more out of this Saber by adding the +10% Weapon Damage Enchantment.

 <p>
  The Dragon's War Bow is an interesting weapon, as it offers great damage and Stagger in its common form. It can be steadily upgraded to an outstanding weapon at the Caretaker's Workshop. With the combination of Fire and Electric damage, Rook can cause some serious harm to their enemies.

 <p>
  To cause even more damage, players can add the +20% Armor Damage Enchantment to deal with those foes that have extra protections. This Longbow can be found in the Rivain Coast during "The Warden Vault" quest or purchased from the Shadow Dragons Faction Vendor once they reach level 4.

 <p>
  The Antivan Rapier is a versatile weapon. It's great for the Duelist Specialization because it offers Necrotic damage. But since its Stagger is so high, it makes a perfect option for a Saboteur build. It also doesn't hurt that once it reaches Uncommon rarity, Rook will gain some Necrotic resistance.

 <p>
  This weapon works well with the +10% Weapon Damage Enchantment. Players can pick up this weapon in a couple of places, including a chest in the Streets of Coin Financials in Treviso and from the Rank 2 Antivan Crows Faction Vendor.

  A bit of information coming from Take-Two Interactive appears to have narrowed down the release window for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Fans are eagerly awaiting
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , but weren't previously given much to go on other than a general window of 2025.

 <p>
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  was officially revealed during The Game Awards 2024, with a video teasing the characters and story players will be meeting in the near future. While the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  series has been popular for a long time, many took issue with
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , with complaints ranging from performance problems at launch to the story and its characters, like Ava. However, anticipation for
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  seems to be high regardless.

 <p>
  Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  developer Gearbox Software, has released a financial report for its second fiscal quarter of 2025. Due to the way fiscal years are calculated, this period ended on September 30, 2024. Within the report, Take-Two notes that
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  will arrive during the company's fiscal 2026 year. This would put its launch somewhere between April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2026. Narrowing this down with the
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  teaser trailer's promise of 2025, that means players shouldn't expect
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  anytime before April 2025, but no later than December.

  Will Borderlands 4 Be Delayed?
 </h2>
 <p>
  At this point, it's difficult to say if
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  will launch in the first half of 2025. Take-Two Interactive likely doesn't want any of its own games to hit the market in the same general window as
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , which is also slated to release in 2025.
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  will almost certainly take over the lives and time of millions of gamers all over the world, which could hurt
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  sales if released too close together. However, industry insiders have speculated that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could be delayed to as late as 2026, which would give
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  a wider window to release under while still meeting its 2025 promise.

  For now, the wisest course of action for fans is to not expect
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  before April 2025. With any luck, the time between then and now is sufficient for Gearbox to release a polished and fun looter shooter experience. Gamers are already intrigued by
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's new villain, new planet, and the promised return of some "familiar faces," so the game is off to a good start in terms of hype. Whether it can deliver will become clear in time.

  Each week, the Siren Isle will cycle through one of three themes: Vrykul, Pirate, and Naga. These modifiers change the enemies, weekly and world quests, and two of the rare spawns found on the island. Some rares are found in the same spots every week, while others are only spawned in the instanced Tempest version of the Siren Isle, which fans can unlock by completing the elite objective each week. Once this is done, players can speak with Suzie Boltwrench to move between the normal and stormy versions of the island, allowing
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  characters to finish quests and upgrade Cyrce's Circlet, the powerful new ring associated with the Siren Isle.

  Beyond this powerful ring, other catch-up gear, and new
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  cosmetics, the Siren Isle is a great place to farm Bronze Celebration Tokens for the 20th anniversary event as well, as each of the abundant weekly quests on the island awards five of them. By completing these Siren Isle weeklies, players will be able to easily pick up the rest of the revamped Tier 2 sets and other rewards they are missing during the last three weeks of the anniversary event.

  won’t have to wait long to get them. Plunderstorm returns to

  for its second run on January 14, 2025, four weeks after the launch of Patch 11.0.7. Between the rewards earned with Flame-Blessed Iron on the Siren Isle and everything players pick up from the Plunderstore, there will be no shortage of seafaring transmog options for fans to choose from over the next couple of months.

  Just as every

  player is gently corralled into the stealth archer archetype (because cheesing certain fights with ranged stealth is the only way to win, stealth perks are drastically overpowered, and because stealth is the most effective skill for every faction), it takes a great deal of effort to avoid visiting this serene little locale at the start of a new playthrough: Riverwood.

  The three Standing Stones are on the way, and it would be a shame to miss out on those bonuses. Then there's all that loot from Helgen that needs selling off. There's also that easy dungeon nearby. And who would turn away the hospitality of a fine Nord home, given the chance? Riverwood always feels like home, thanks to its tranquil vibes and friendly faces (unless the player happens to kill one beloved chicken, in which case all Oblivion breaks loose).

  Pallet Town is the quintessential video game starter town, offering just enough to introduce players to the world of Pokemon without overwhelming them. With only a handful of buildings and a population small enough to fit on a single bus (not that any motorized vehicles could navigate the tall grass blocking the only route out), it perfectly captures the charm of "humble beginnings."

  While
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  features many memorable starter towns, Pallet Town stands out as one of the most iconic. Its name, inspired by the idea of a "blank canvas," is an auspicious portent of the color-themed towns and diverse Pokémon ahead that players are sure to encounter on their journey. The town's motto is even "Shades of your journey await," which seems suspiciously specific.

  Both games have elements of childhood wonder and weighty maturity, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Twilight Princess
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, in many ways, a grown-up version of
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  . It stars an adult Link in a similar starting location as
  <em>
   Ocarina
  </em>
  , with both serving as a safe zone to learn the game.

  However, unlike Kokiri Village, which successfully emulates the nostalgic and surreal experience of coming back home after years away only to realize that nobody there grew up and that everything feels small, Ordon Village feels lived in, rustic, and somewhat more dynamic than the play area of unaging fairy children. This might be, in part, thanks to Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto's last-minute change to the opening, in which three days of tutorial content were added to help ease players in, including more time with Ordon's memorable residents.

  The Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas is an unforgiving place at the best of times. The generosity of Goodsprings' inhabitants is what makes this town stand out in a desert of pain. A doctor mends up the Courier after they take a tumble into an early grave (for free, to boot), and everyone in the town is eager to help them get on their feet.

 <p>
  Sure, the town may be a little run down and occasionally under attack, but the town has its rustic charms, and no matter what hits Goodsprings, it always finds a way to bounce back. Plus, true to its name, it is an excellent source of fresh water, something that
  <em>
   Fallout

  players who run on Hardcore Mode will appreciate all the more.

  The
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series has many meme-worthy and memorable openings. Many Morrow-boomers will have memorized the spiel from Jub, the Imperial guards, and Socucius Ergalla at the opening of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Morrowind,
   </strong>
  </em>
  just as most Sky-babies will be able to run off the opening dialogue of
  <em>
   Skyrim.
  </em>
  Character creation ends as soon as players exit to Seyda Neen, but the town itself is where the game really begins, and it does a great job of showing players what to expect on their adventures.

  Fargoth (and his missing ring problem) helps teach players about the consequences of choice during quests, buying and selling, and the open-ended nature of decision-making in
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  . In a wonderful example of game design restraint and respect for player agency, players are never stopped and forced to engage in any of the town's drama, such as the caper of the missing tax collector and his lover, Fargoth's nightly secret, the nearby slave den, or Vodunius' dilemma, and are completely free to wander past it all, dipping in only if a story piques their interest.

  Video games, especially those with a grand adventure as their backbone, rely on giving their players a sense of progress. There might be no greater feeling of growth than that seen in Fable, one of the few games that use the novelty of growing from childhood to adulthood as a catalyst for player choice and character development.

  Of course, the tragic killing of the main character's family and community, being the inciting incident for the story, requires that their town of Oakvale be as idyllic as possible before its demise. Oakvale serves as a great tutorial area where players can complete quests for their obnoxious neighbors and learn how to play in the process.

  <strong>
   The Game Awards 2024
  </strong>
  has seen major success, gaining the biggest audience yet at one of the annual award shows. Over its ten year history, The Game Awards has come a very long way, with viewers turning out in droves to see if their favorite games won awards and what game announcements are made.

 <p>
  The Game Awards is a monumental time for game developers and fans alike. The event has been held every year, even during the COVID era, celebrating the best games of the year and granting a number of awards to members of the community, as well. The Game Awards had an impressive - but comparitively humble - start, with 1.4 million viewers, and has experienced a meteoric rise since.

 <p>
  Now, The Game Awards has revealed that 2024 was its biggest year yet, with a stunning 154 million global livestreams. 2023 was a big year for The Game Awards, setting a record of its own, but 2024 saw a 31% increase over 2023, up from 118 million livestreams. In addition to official streams from The Game Awards itself, this number has been aided by co-streams, in which streamers broadcast the show with commentary while their audiences watch. In all, nearly 16,000 co-stream broadcasts were held this year.

  The Game Awards 2024 Sets New Records
 </h2>
 <p>
  In addition to overall viewership, The Game Awards 2024 reached new records overall. Outside of platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and X, The Game Awards was also streamed worldwide, including Chinese streaming services like Bilibili and Weibo. With
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  nominated for the Best Game of the Year award, the show likely found more viewers in China than ever. Viewers were also more involved in the results than usual, with viewer voting rising to 112 million this year, up 25% from 2023.

  In addition to the awards themselves, The Game Awards draws attention every year for its live performances and game trailer debuts and reveals. This year's show saw major game announcements like
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  , and new Naughty Dog title
  <em>
   The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  with new teasers and trailers. Live performances included famous names like Snoop Dogg and Twenty One Pilots, and the returning Game Awards Orchestra. Tons of industry names made appearances and presented awards as well, including Todd Howard, Hideo Kojima, Harrison Ford, Sam Lake, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker.

  Now that E3 is officially dead, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley's other show, Summer Game Fest, have become some of the predominant shows of the gaming industry. It will be interesting to see if The Game Awards can continue the trend in 2025 and top this year's numbers and accomplishments.

  <em>
   <strong>
    CK3 AGOT
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a total conversion mod for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  , inspired by
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   A Song of Ice and Fire
  </em>
  book series. The most recent update to the colossal mod has seen the introduction of dragons, as well as new start dates, set around the time of
  <em>
   House of the Dragon
  </em>
  . A time when dragons still ruled the skies of Westeros.

  One of the best features of the
  <em>
   CK3 AGOT
  </em>
  dragon update is that players can hatch dragon eggs of various colors and patterns.
  <strong>
   How to hatch a dragon in
   <em>
    CK3 AGOT
   </em>
  </strong>
  , very much depends on if dragons exist in the current timeline. If they do, then cradling an egg as a young Targaryen is much easier than the arduous trials and tribulations of attempting to hatch an egg long turned to stone, centuries after dragons died out.

 <p>
  Before players can contemplate hatching a dragon egg, they first need to acquire one, and for many non-Targaryen characters, this can prove quite the challenge. For those lucky enough to be born into a Dragonriding House, female dragons have a
  <strong>
   random chance each year to lay one or more eggs
  </strong>
  . These eggs can then be handed out by the head of the House.

  Some characters, such as King Aegon V and Maelys the Monstrous, start the game with stone dragon eggs, making them two of the best starting rulers for
  <em>
   CK3 AGOT

  , particularly for bookmarks after dragons have died out.

  Players will even find that these two characters have special events relating to their desire to bring dragons back.
  <strong>
   Created rulers with the Dragonrider Trait can also start the game with a dragon egg

  Characters with few or no ties to dragons will first have to unlock a Diplomacy Perk, Accomplished Forger, which grants the
  <strong>
   Buy Artifact Claims interaction to be used on owners of eggs
  </strong>
  . The only problem is that it costs an obscene amount of Prestige to acquire the claim.

 <p>
  Even with a claim, players will either have to go to war for the egg or succeed in a plot to steal it. There is also an extremely low chance of finding a dragon egg when visiting Winterfell's crypts, or sending a legendary adventurer to Dragonstone. If players are looking for stone eggs long after dragons have died out, then a certain Magister Illyrio may not yet have bequeathed his to Daenerys.

  The easiest way to hatch dragon eggs in
  <em>
   CK3 AGOT
  </em>
  is for them to be cradled by members of Dragonriding Houses, such as Targaryens. This is done by
  <strong>
   right-clicking on the character's portrait and selecting Send Dragon Egg
  </strong>
  or Cradle Dragon Egg if it's the player's own character. Nothing else needs to be done apart from wait and pray. Success is not guaranteed, and it can take a few years for an egg to hatch. If it does not hatch, the egg will eventually turn to stone.

 <p>
  If players don't have enough children in their dynasty to cradle a new clutch of eggs, or if they don't want certain characters to become dragonriders, then there is an option to have eggs hatch in Dragonpits. To do so, simply
  <strong>
   find the Head Dragonkeeper and right-click on them
  </strong>
  to bring up the
  <strong>
   Send Egg to Dragonpit option
  </strong>
  . Eggs can always be retrieved in the same way.

  For those playing in the later bookmarks, after dragons have died out, there is thankfully a way to
  <strong>
   revive dragons in
   <em>
    CK3 AGOT
   </em>
  </strong>
  , although it is by no means easy and it is incredibly dangerous. If players are nevertheless intent on this goal, they will
  <strong>
   need a stone dragon egg and some Dragonblood heritage
  </strong>
  . For example, Robert Baratheon has the correct heritage thanks to his Targaryen grandmother. Before they begin the Dragon Egg Hatching activity, however, it is best to acquire Dragonlore knowledge.

  Dragonlore is essential for succeeding in a hatching ceremony and while books may be added in the future, the current way to acquire this knowledge is by traveling the world. When planning an activity that requires travel, players can
  <strong>
   customize their route to pass through Sites of Draconic Significance
  </strong>
  . Upon arriving, an event will trigger and the character will improve their Dragonlore knowledge.

  Once players have an egg, and they are satisfied with the Dragonlore they have gathered, it's time to plan a Dragon Egg Hatching activity. To do so, players will need
  <strong>
   lots of Gold, Prestige, and Piety
  </strong>
  . The first step is deciding on a
  <strong>
   Knowledge Hatching or an Esoteric Hatching
  </strong>
  . The former relies on maesters and other scholars, whereas the latter makes use of those with arcane knowledge, such as warlocks and alchemists.

 <p>
  Next, players will
  <strong>
   choose a location for the ceremony
  </strong>
  , with Dragonstone being an ideal location if available, due to the volcanic nature of the island. The rest is like any activity in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  , with players planning a route, choosing guests, and deciding how much they'd like to spend on the activity. For any real hope of hatching an egg this way, it's best to go all out on the Sacrifice and Catalyst. This requires even more gold.

  Once the activity begins, players will make a series of choices, such as which egg to use, and
  <strong>
   who will lead the ceremony
  </strong>
  . A trickier decision, especially if players opted for the more expensive and powerful sacrifice option, is exactly
  <strong>
   whose blood or even life to give
  </strong>
  . Next is the Catalyst to be chosen, and this is where holding the activity on Dragonstone comes in useful, as

      <title>Mafia: The Old Country's Setting Is Exactly What The Series Needs</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/video/mafia-the-old-country-setting-series-needs/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Almost eight years after the third game was released, Mafia: The Old Country, the fourth entry in the series, has finally been revealed. A short teaser trailer has revealed that developer Hangar 13 has decided to go in a new direction with the game's setting. Instead of continuing the series timeline by advancing into the 1970s and beyond, Mafia: The Old Country will instead be set at the turn of the 19th Century, and feature a story woven around the birth of the Mafia in Sicily. This change of pace could prove a smart move and be just what the series needs.

  broke player count records when it was released, but it has since seen a decline in active players. The game's community manager Bucky recently expressed enthusiasm for
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's success in surpassing their player count record. As Pocket Pair continues to add content and fixes with occasional updates, some players return to catch up on what they've missed. Despite this, the game still has a dedicated community that continues to collect rare Pals and build impressive structures. Among these is a massive tree house town created by one dedicated gamer.

  Reddit user HaxleyMODS recently shared a video tour of their
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  tree house town named Palethin. The clip begins with the player rising above a central portion of the town, resulting in different parts of it popping in as they go higher. Numerous angled structures then come into view, with an expansive wooden walkway connecting each one. Each path has fences on either side to prevent players from plummeting to the ground below, likely resulting in the death of their custom
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  character. There are lamp posts in the middle of most branching paths in the town, and Villagers patrol the area to make the area feel lived in. The video concludes with the player fitting their entire town into the frame, highlighting the massive scale of their tree house town.

  Other than the structures housing the working Pals and other important workstations, the town also includes carpeted areas, an Anubis statue, a bar, two hot springs, and a minimally furnished modern-style house. Given the height of this build, HaxleyMODS has an impressive view of
  <em>

  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  aesthetic, the Reddit user credited
  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  building restrictions, gamers will need to download the four packs if they wish to mimic this design.

  <strong>
   Dr Disrespect
  </strong>
  has made yet another change to his social media channels, replacing an old Twitter header that previously prompted some rampant speculation among his followers. The move appears to be part of his efforts to attempt a comeback after admitting to the circumstances surrounding his 2020 Twitch ban.

 <p>
  Back in late June 2024, Dr Disrespect admitted to sharing "inappropriate" messages with a minor via Twitch Whispers, a now-discontinued private messaging feature of Amazon's streaming service. The content creator said this had occurred in 2017, but insisted that there were no "real intentions" behind the messages. This is believed to have been the reason for him getting permanently banned from Twitch three years later.

  Dr Disrespect Removes Cryptic Social Media Header
 </h2>
 <p>
  The streamer changed his Twitter header page to that of a fishing bobber in late July 2024. Another version of this image uploaded two weeks later saw Dr Disrespect imply that his admission of having inappropriate contact with a minor was some kind of bait. This prompted a lot of speculation among his followers, convincing a number of them that there is more to the story about his Twitch exit. Another two weeks later, Dr Disrespect has now once again changed his Twitter header, replacing the cryptic graphic with a more generic image of him in his signature red vest in front of a vaporwave rendition of a beach.

  This change occurred shortly after Dr Disrespect announced he will resume streaming in the near future. "We'll be back soon," the content creator wrote in an August 14 tweet, adding that there will be "lots to talk about" once he returns. The message received a polarizing reception from social media users; while some offered words of support, others appeared exasperated by the notion of the streamer making a comeback attempt, arguing that someone who admitted to what he did should not have a platform to come back to.

 <p>
  Just before he last reiterated his intentions to return to streaming, Dr Disrespect deleted his original admission of exchanging inappropriate messages with a minor. While this particular move indicates he is trying to move past the scandal, his recent insistence that there is still "lots to talk about" suggests the opposite.

 <p>
  The content creator faces numerous roadblocks in his ambition to return to streaming, not least because the Twitch Whispers controversy prompted many of his sponsors to drop him. YouTube also demonetized Dr Disrespect's channel in the immediate aftermath of the scandal. Game Rant's review of his YouTube channel suggests that decision still stands nearly two months later, as of late August 2024. Without sponsors or the ability to have ads in his videos and broadcasts, the only feasible ways for Dr Disrespect to continue making money from streaming would be to resort to accepting donations via third-party platforms like Patreon or PayPal and double down on his merch business.

  A new report indicates that the
  <strong>
   Meta Quest Pro 2
  </strong>
  is no longer in development and that its release has been canceled. Though the parent company continues to work on other Meta Quest headsets, the follow-up to its most expensive and powerful headset to date may be no more.

  Despite its best-known product being Facebook, Meta is behind one of the best virtual reality headset lines to ever exist. The Oculus Quest, now Meta Quest, is a series of VR headsets that are completely wireless, allowing users to enjoy them without a need for sensors, cameras, or connections to a PC. When the first Oculus Quest launched, it was revolutionary for its time, and while the Meta Quest Pro has had difficulty finding a market, the standard Quest line continues to perform for the company.

 <p>
  Now, a report from The Information, via UploadVR, indicates that the Meta Quest Pro 2 has been canceled. The report alleges that Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth called for development to end during a recent product review meeting. Bosworth acknowledged the report, indicating that projects and prototypes are frequently shelved at Meta, and that it's simply part of the development process. Although he didn't confirm if the follow-up to the Meta Quest Pro has been completely shelved, it seems as though his response confirms that there's at least some legitimacy to the claims.

  Why Was the Meta Quest Pro 2 Allegedly Canceled?
 </h2>
 <p>
  While the Meta Quest Pro 2 likely would have taken the platform to new heights in terms of visual fidelity and overall performance, its apparent cancelation may be due to the performance of its predecessor. Despite price cuts, the Meta Quest Pro hasn't sold well for the company. While it has excellent specs, the Meta Quest Pro's price point of $1000+ has likely turned off average consumers, and it's not clear if businesses ever really adopted it as Meta had hoped. With its focus on business use, it's possible the Meta Quest Pro may have sold better if it released during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many workers were stuck at home and had to telecommute.

 <p>
  However, this doesn't mean the end for the virtual reality headsets. Whether the Meta Quest Pro 2 has been truly canceled or not, the standard Meta Quest line is still popular, and at a more affordable price point and a variety of pleasing apps and games like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 VR
  </em>
  for players to enjoy. Currently, it's believed that the Meta Quest 3S, a more affordable version of the standard Meta Quest 3, is in production, and that Meta Quest 4 will eventually be released, though perhaps not for years. Fans will have to wait and see what's next for Meta's vision of VR, but for now, the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro are the most powerful devices available from the company.

      Need for Speed: Most Wanted, a classic 2005 game, is still in high demand, with physical copies selling for around $60.
     </li>
     <li>
      While the original Xbox 360 version can go for $50-$70, the 2012 remaster has much lower price tags, as low as $10.
     </li>
     <li>
      GameStop, known for marking up prices, offers just over $11 for trading in the Platinum Hits version of Need for Speed: Most Wanted.

 <p>
  An unspecified video game store is selling
  <strong>
   <em>
    Need for Speed: Most Wanted
   </em>
  </strong>
  for nearly 60 bucks. The 2005 racing game was originally released for the seventh generation of consoles, i.e. the PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360 era. Developed and published by EA,
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted
  </em>
  is considered by many to be one of the best titles in the long-lived franchise, earning praise for its graphics, sound effects, maps, and cutscenes, and even bringing home several awards when it first launched.

 <p>
  Given the game’s well-earned success, combined with the recent permanent shutdown of the Xbox 360 digital marketplace, the demand for physical versions of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted
  </em>
  has likely increased in recent weeks. In some places, finding a ready supply of physical copies of various video games in good condition is becoming increasingly difficult, due to the industry’s ongoing transition to digital and the subsequent closure of brick-and-mortar gaming shops that used to be a mainstay in many strip malls.

 <p>
  The burgeoning demand for physical games and the shutdown of the 360 Marketplace may partly be the reason that Reddit user skylinefan26 recently found a used Xbox 360 copy of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted
  </em>
  at a video game store for $59.99. Granted, it’s an original release of the game and not from the “Platinum Hits” line, which usually sells for less, but that still might seem like an outrageous price for a nearly 20-year-old game.

 <p>
  However, a browse on eBay reveals that $50-$70 is actually a pretty “reasonable” price for an Xbox 360 physical copy of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted.
  </em>
  There are even copies selling in that price range with no cover. Surprisingly, the original Xbox version and the later 2012 remaster of
  <em>
   Most Wanted
  </em>
  are selling for significantly less, with price tags as low as 10 bucks. And for those who just want to play the game and aren’t necessarily collectors, it’s worth noting that the remastered version of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted
  </em>
  can currently be purchased digitally from both Steam and Epic Games Store for $2.99 thanks to a limited-time sale.

 <p>
  GameStop, which might not in fact be the store that skylinefan26 was visiting when they found the $60 copy of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted,
  </em>
  is notorious for paying pennies for traded-in games and then marking them up substantially for reselling. It’s always been a sacrifice gamers had to make if they wanted the convenience of making a quick buck for their used games. Currently, the Platinum Hits version of
  <em>
   Need for Speed: Most Wanted
  </em>
  has a GameStop trade-in price of just over $11 for non-Pro members.

      <title>Roblox: Z Piece Codes (August 2024)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As the name suggests,
  <em>
   Z Piece
  </em>
  is based on the
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  anime. In it, you have to choose a pirate or marine side and then become the strongest in all the seas. But, of course, at the beginning, you will be weak. So, to make your journey a little easier, you should use
  <em>
   Z Piece
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>

 <p>
  With these codes, players can get various useful rewards. These can be both Spins and useful boosters. But, regardless of the reward, all codes expire after a while. If you do not want to miss out on free goodies, you should use them as soon as possible.

  Most of the quests in
  <em>
   Z Piece
  </em>
  require players to fight certain enemies, giving XP and currency as a reward. But the further you progress, the more difficult the enemies will be. So, you need to spend time upgrading your stats after each new level. But, at first, it is quite difficult to earn XP quickly. In this case,
  <em>
   Z Piece
  </em>
  codes can help you.

 <p>
  Most of these codes reward players with XP boosters. And although they work temporarily, they increase the experience gained by two times. Also, it is important to note that the codes expire after a certain time after the release. So, you should use the codes as soon as possible.

  Peat and Sod are just a couple of the various crafting materials to discover in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fields of Mistria
   </strong>
  </em>
  , a charming and wholesome RPG farm sim by NPC Studio. The first time you'll probably come across Peat and Sod is when accepting Celine's
  <strong>
   Request for Gardening Materials
  </strong>
  , who wants them for her potting soil mix. Chances are you'll want to learn
  <strong>
   how to get Peat and Sod
  </strong>
  as quickly as possible so you can tick off another quest and gain increased Renown for the town. Celine also throws in a Tulip and Daffodil as a reward for your efforts, which make great gifts if you're hoping to romance one of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  's characters.

  The quickest way to get Peat in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  is to buy a shovel or use your pickaxe. Whichever option you choose, you can use your pickaxe or shovel to unearth small
  <strong>
   dig spots in
  </strong>
  <strong>
   randomized areas of the map
  </strong>
  that look like miniature hills to give you various possible finds, including Peat and Sod. This even includes the
  <strong>
   beach
  </strong>
  , where it's also possible to find Peat.

  If you've unlocked

  in

   breaking rocks
  </strong>
  there. Sometimes you'll just get stone, or ores like Copper Ore, but rocks can also drop Peat or Sod. You'll probably have to destroy several rocks before Peat or Sod spawns which can use a lot of stamina, so you might prefer to try searching for dig spots instead. It's also worth making sure you've got plenty of space to carry more stuff in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  to avoid destroying items you might prefer to keep or making the trip home early.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the newest entry in the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  franchise, released as part of this week’s 10th Anniversary Celebration event. The title marks a series of firsts for the franchise, as it boasts 2D survival horror gameplay and adapts a short story from the
  <em>
   Fazbear's Frights
  </em>
  novel canon for the screen.
  <em>
  </em>
  While not an open-world title,
  <em>
   Into the Pit
  </em>
  takes a modern approach to its survival-horror elements, with the title tasking defenseless players with navigating a series of environments, collecting items, and avoiding its wandering horrors. To accomplish this,
  <em>
   Into the Pit
  </em>
  takes open-world mechanics from another groundbreaking
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  title,
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach,
  </em>
  and adapts them to a new genre.

  Developed by Mega Cat Studios,
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit
  </em>
  tells the story of a 10-year-old boy, Oswald, who discovers an abandoned ball pit at a local eatery, Jeff's Pizza. Jumping in, he is shocked to discover that the pit can transport him back in time to 1985, when the restaurant was a thriving Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Things quickly go awry, as Oswald arrives on the day that Spring Bonnie killed six children in the past, causing him to flee the yellow rabbit. However, his nightmare is far from over, as Spring Bonnie reaches through the pit, capturing his father and replacing him in the present. With a Spring Bonnie that only he can see hunting him each night, Oswald must use anything he can find to escape his home and return to the past. Only then can he find his father and end the chain of events he started.

  <em>
   2021's Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach
  </em>
  revolutionized the classic
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  formula for a modern survival horror experience. The title
  <em>
  </em>
  took an open-world approach to its core gameplay mechanics, with players exploring the Mega Pizzaplex, while obtaining key items, hiding, and luring its animatronic cast on the way to each objective. While this groundbreaking effort included a number of technical issues, the ideas put forth by
  <em>
   Security Breach
  </em>
  shifted the series in a new direction, and paved the way for a superior DLC experience,
  <em>
   RUIN,
  </em>
  to incorporate the mechanics to great effect in 2023.
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit
  </em>
  takes these core mechanics and adapts them for a pair of semi-open spaces, Oswald's House and Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.

  Players experience five days and nights as Oswald, as he searches for ways to free his father from Spring Bonnie's grasp. Each night, players must first help Oswald escape his house, which requires him to find a route and the items required to open it. Defenseless, Oswald must avoid Spring Bonnie, lure him to different rooms, or hide, much like
  <em>
   Security Breach
  </em>
  's Gregory, before moving on to the next area. Once he escapes, players are essentially thrust into a 2D version of
  <em>
   Security Breach
  </em>
  , as Oswald uses a map to avoid Spring Bonnie and a host of retro animatronics at Freddy Fazbear's. Oswald can navigate the Pizzeria as he pleases, luring and hiding his way through its many rooms, with optional items and hidden arcade games offering enticing risks and alternative routes. After accomplishing each night's central task, Oswald must escape the Pizzeria while being chased by frenzied animatronics, before returning to the present and starting again the next day.

  While
  <em>
   Security Breach
  </em>
  is the closest the
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  franchise has gotten to an open-world experience,
  <em>
   Into the Pit
  </em>
  offers more freedom in its exploration. The Mega Pizzaplex offers players linear routes to accomplish their goals, with its major tasks enclosed in a variety of isolated areas.
  <em>
   Into the Pit
  </em>
  's map is also broken into isolated areas, but the house and Pizzeria allow Oswald to reach objectives by any route he sees fit, as long as he has the required item for the final door. In later nights, vents can be unlocked to form new routes between rooms, aiding in exploration and the avoidance of the growing number of active animatronics.
  <em>
   Into the Pit
  </em>
  also modifies animatronic encounters, offering players the chance to avoid a jumpscare by completing first-person mini-games while hiding.

  <em>
   The Time of Ninja
  </em>
  is one of the RPG titles based on the popular
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  franchise. In it, you have to become a real shinobi with unique abilities and weapons. However, your clan and elements depend on RNG, so to get the desired bonuses, you will need Spins. Luckily, they can be easily obtained with
  <em>
   The Time of Ninja
  </em>
  codes.

 <p>
  At the beginning of your journey in
  <em>
   The Time of Ninja
  </em>
  , you can create a character to your taste. And in addition to appearance, players also need to choose a Clan and Element that can give them additional buffs and unlock unique abilities. However, they can all be rolled in exchange for Spins, which are not abundant at the beginning. If you are unlucky enough to not get the desired abilities, then
  <em>
   The Time of Ninja
  </em>
  codes will help you fix this.

 <p>
  As we said, codes provide players with various rewards. But, often, they reward Spins for both Clans and Elements. Therefore, they are especially useful in the early stages of the game, when you are creating your shinobi. However, the activity period of each code is limited. Therefore, you should hurry to use them so as not to miss out on free goodies.

  As befits an RPG,
  <em>
   The Time of Ninja
  </em>
  has a fairly detailed menu. Therefore, it is a little more difficult to find the codes feature than in other
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences. But, following the steps below, you can easily cope with this task:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   First, launch
   <em>
    The Time of Ninja
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Then, spawn on the map.
  </li>
  <li>
   After that, open the menu by clicking on the M key.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, you need to select the Extra Menu. It is the rightmost button on the menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, click on the Twitter icon, enter the code, and press the Enter button.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  If you do everything correctly and the codes are still active, you will see a message about the successful use of the code.

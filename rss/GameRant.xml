  It seems more and more Xbox gamers are diving back into the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Gears of War
   </strong>
  </em>
  series, likely due to the swirling excitement surrounding The Coalition's recently revealed
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  . Xbox just had what some are calling its best games showcase ever. New gameplay footage for big Xbox titles like
  <em>
   Fable, South of Midnight, Perfect Dark,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  was revealed, as well as an epic new
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  game named
  <em>
   The Dark Ages
  </em>
  . Even with all of this considered,
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  arguably made the biggest splash of the show.

 <p>
  Many
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  fans were expecting to see a follow-up to 2019's
  <em>
   Gears 5
  </em>
  when rumors began cropping up about a Coalition appearance at Xbox's showcase. Instead, longtime fans were pleased to learn that
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  is a prequel to the main trilogy, set fourteen years before the events of the original game and focusing on Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they struggle to survive the early days of the Locust invasion. The Coalition also expressed that
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  will turn up the horror dial as it attempts to make Locust Drones, known as cannon fodder throughout the series, much more formidable and scary to face, as seen in the heavy-hitting reveal trailer.

  Not even two weeks after
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  's reveal, TrueAchievements has reported that some
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  titles have seen massive player spikes following
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  's announcement. The title enjoying the largest jump is
  <em>
   Gears of War: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  , the 2015 remaster of the original
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  game, which rose in players a whopping 323% according to TrueAchievements. This makes a ton of sense considering
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  's place in the franchise's timeline and its enticing promise to return to a more horror-heavy tone and setting akin to the earliest
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  games.

  Players aren't just jumping into
  <em>
   Gears of War: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Gears 5
  </em>
  has surprisingly seen a big player boost too, landing it on TrueAchievement's weekly top 40 chart at 34, over games like
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   FIFA 23
  </em>
  . Though not as significant as
  <em>
   Gears 5
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  's spikes,
  <em>
   Gears of War 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gears 3
  </em>
  enjoyed some extra attention as well. There's no doubt that these
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  player spikes are a direct result of The Coalition's
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  reveal, which seems to have reignited the
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  fanbase, much like the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  Amazon series did to Bethesda's
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games a few months ago.

  While it hasn't received an official release window,
  <em>

  is rumored to be looking at a 2025 release. Though, considering Xbox already has

  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  being a sequel means there are many things from the previous game that could make a potential return. One of those things is enemies and those who have encountered the Illuminate are preparing for them to threaten Super Earth yet again. While implementing the Illuminate faction could expand
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  in many ways, it also brings a question of significant importance.

 <p>
  New enemies are bound to make their way into
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , but the game has made it clear that the door is also open for old foes to reappear. Given the details provided by credible
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  leakers and the events leading to the destruction of Meridia, players may see the return of the Illuminate faction in a big way. Given the challenge they brought in the previous game, many will wonder what weapons have the potential of easily besting them upon their arrival. While
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has a multitude of equipment for dealing with a variety of enemies, figuring out which ones are effective against those with psychic abilities could eventually become a top priority.

 <p>
  The arrival of a new foe means trying to understand what works well against them. One of the major things players should know about the Illuminate faction is that they are a race that's notorious for having shields. It allows them to attack boldly and removing their protective shell of defense requires proper commitment or else they regenerate. This means weapons with a high rate of fire would be useful as they will be responsible for quickly removing the shields, exposing the enemy to kill shots. Given the current equipment in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , there are a few weapons that would make excellent candidates for Illuminate shield removal duty.

 <h3 id="the-potential-changes-to-the-illuminate-and-what-they-could-mean">
  The Potential Changes to the Illuminate and What They Could Mean
 </h3>
 <p>
  Should the Illuminate return, it is likely that they will have modified their technology. This means that strategies that worked against them in the previous game may not be as effective now. Although
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has many amazing primary weapons and support equipment, figuring out which will work well against the potential new Illuminate requires a careful understanding of the enemy. They may have evolved to be immune to energy-based weaponry, meaning armaments such as the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="641092" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   SG-8P Punisher Plasma
  </span>
  or the powerful
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="653903" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   LAS-99 Quasar Cannon
  </span>
  might do little to no damage. If that were to be the case, players who primarily use energy-based weapons would have to devise new loadouts that are best for dealing with the Illuminate's weaknesses.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1225} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  With the likelihood of their shortcomings being the same as the previous game, weapons with high rates of fire will likely become the go-to for missions involving the highly sophisticated threat. The Illuminate could even lead to new major orders in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  that, upon completion, could potentially introduce a new Warbond specifically for going against the psychic-powered enemy faction. Such an update can be useful because it gives players more options while also cluing them in on what the enemy faction is truly weak against. This allows everyone to determine which of their current equipment will be the most useful against the Illuminate without spending on potential new weapons.

 <p>
  The arrival of a black hole after Meridia's destruction would make now a perfect time to introduce a new enemy faction in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . The likelihood of it being the Illuminate is high and speculation about the enemy's potential new weaknesses will have players scrambling to figure them out. Although veterans from the previous game will have an idea of the best weapons for dealing with them, the developers can always surprise everyone by giving the Illuminate new shortcomings that nobody will expect.

      <title>Elden Ring: 16 Best Armor To Negate Lightning Damage &amp; Where To Find Them</title>

  Contrary to popular belief, lightning can strike twice in the same place, and in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it can strike much more than that, especially if the enemy is a cheating spammer like those late-game dragons. Against such enemies who are intent on turning the Tarnished into lightning rods, it helps to prepare some countermeasures, and armor stands out as the most accessible among these.

 <p>
  Not all armor in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is protective, of course. In fact, one might even be surprised to learn that armor sets with the most metal parts tend to make for terrible lightning insulation. That kind of adherence to elementary-level science in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  doesn't bode well for players who want to protect themselves against one of the most troublesome damage types in the game. Thankfully, these armor sets are good exceptions.

  <em>
   Lightning damage has always been one of the most dangerous types in Elden Ring. That's why lightning-resistant armor can be a literal life-saver, especially in late-game areas, where the game has more cruel surprises involving lightning. For instance, lightning resistance is reduced when characters are wet. Therefore, equipping the highest defense armors with good lightning resistance stats can be a crucial countermeasure in some of the game's more difficult regions. More armor with the highest lightning resistance has been added to the list to prepare players for the upcoming challenges of the
   <strong>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
   expansion.

  has a ridiculous headpiece and questionable physical defense, but all that is excused once players use it against mage enemies or dragons. The Queen of the Full Moon armor boasts one of the most consistently resistant stats in the game.

 <p>
  For that matter, it's no slouch when it comes to protecting its wearer against magic or elemental attacks. That said, players still shouldn't expect to poise through some of the toughest and heaviest lightning attacks in the game while wearing it. On the plus side, however, the armor's low weight can allow for some incredibly fast rolls.

  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657874" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Mushroom Set

  is also unique because its pieces are found separately in the game. Players will find the set's crown (or its pileus?) while exploring the Lake of Rot, on a corpse hanging off the top of a column. The rest of this unusual set can be found in Seethewater Cave in Mt. Gelmir, in a cavern with a Giant Poison Flower and multiple mushroom people.

  The Mushroom Set is one of the greatest in the game in terms of various elemental and status effect resistances and is often used in some of
  <em>

  </em>
  's most difficult areas, like the aforementioned Lake of Rot. Due to its very special looks, this armor is not too compatible with other sets in the game and is better used separately.

   Crimson Hood

  , earlier worn by Roderika, players need to complete her questline, unlocking spirit tuning in Roundtable Hold. After that, return to Stormveil Castle and search for this item atop the pile of bodies of Roderika's people, where the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="660555" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Chrysalids' Memento

  One NPC that players meet who decides to go rogue has one of the best armor sets in the game. The lucky imposing Recusant would be
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="659879" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Knight Bernahl
  </span>
  . He'll later invade players just before the final area boss arena in Crumbling Farum Azula

 <p>
  This is a rather important invasion as he'll drop a trick item to help with the boss. Along with that, he'll also drop his lovely armor set and his weapon. It's also advisable to fight Bernahl before fighting the Draconic Tree Sentinel guarding Maliketh's boss room because the

  The

   Scaled Set

  is a great choice for mid-game melee builds, offering strong Poise, solid Physical defense, and robust Lightning damage negation. With its universal corroded metal look, players can also combine parts of this set with other similar armor in the game, creating a unique knightly appearance. As with most armor in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , players can remove the armor's cape by altering the armaments at any Site of Grace.

  Such armor is also worn by one of Fia's champions, but he doesn't drop this set after the fight. With its high weight, players should expect great Poise and Physical damage negation, and
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657761" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Lionel's Set
  </span>
  doesn't disappoint. On top of that, it grants one of the best stats for lightning, fire, and magic defense, making it useful in various combat encounters.

  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657791" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Fire Prelate Set

  <em>

 <p>
  To obtain the full Fire Prelate Set, players need to hunt for

   Prelate
  </span>
  enemies in
  <em>

  </em>
  . It is recommended to boost one's Arcane stats for better results (players can use the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="658182" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Silver Tear Mask
  </span>
  that increases Arcane by +8), or use the Silver Scarab Talisman or
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="660927" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot
  </span>
  . The best farming spots for this set are Fort Laeidd in Mt. Gelmir and Guardians' Garrison in the Mountaintops of the Giants.

   Banished Knight Set

  is a gift that keeps on giving in
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  . Apart from having one of the most balanced and stylish designs in the game, it also boasts good lightning resistance, making it a well-rounded armor for all occasions. It's quite heavy, but that's a fair trade-off.

  Acquiring it is the only difficult and daunting aspect of this armor. The parts randomly drop from

  Don't want to dress like a nun? Then the good news is that one of the most stylish armor sets in the game has impeccable lightning resistance. The
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657850" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Ronin's Set
  </span>
  , which is worn by

   Bloody Finger Hunter Yura
  </span>
  (and
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="659865" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Shabriri
  </span>
  later on), is the peak of Samurai aesthetics in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . The flowy and battle-worn cloak as well as the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657986" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Iron Kasa
  </span>
  hat will surely turn heads in multiplayer.

 <p>
  Obtaining the Ronin's Set is sadly not possible during the early game. Players will have to finish Yura's questline or refrain from killing Yura themselves. Either of the two options will result in Shabriri possessing Yura and showing up later on in the Mountaintop of the Giants in the Zamor Ruins Site of Grace. Players can kill Shabriri here inconsequentially after talking to him and looting the armor from him.

  The
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657838" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Traveling Maiden Set

  is barely armor. In fact, it's just a nun's robe in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  since "maidens" are envoys of the Two Fingers. But when one is looking for a reliable way to stave off some lightning attacks, then the Traveling Maiden Set more than delivers. The cloth is probably padded with rubber.

  Too bad players can't obtain it until they're in the late game, specifically in the Mountaintop of the Giants. This armor set can be located in the Shack of the Lofty. It's near the western end of the frozen river that flows from the big frozen lake. The trek there is pretty easy, though, and outside the shack is a good place to farm Runes.

  Master Lusat has one of the most protective armor sets out of all the magic-focused apparel in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This protection trickled down to lightning, as it also has good lightning resistance on top of magic. It's mostly for Intelligence builds since

  It turns out that players don't have to look far in order to obtain a lightning-resistance armor set. The
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657908" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Astrologer Set
  </span>
  is a starting armor in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  if players pick the Astrologer class. It's light and convenient for magic or Intelligence builds due to its high magical and elemental protection. Physical protection leaves much to be desired, however.

 <p>
  For those who didn't start with the Astrologer class but still want the Astrologer Set, the armor can be bought from

   Dung Eater
  </span>
  , but one can't deny the effectiveness of his armor. It's one of the most protective sets in the game. The
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="657866" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">

  Getting it is a little troublesome, but players can have it during mid-game. There are two methods of obtaining it, and both of them involve initiating Dung Eater's questline by giving him a
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="660567" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   Seedbed Curse
  </span>
  . Players can find one of these Seedbed Curses in Leyndell, Royal Capital in an octagon tower after an elevator. One the item has been given to Dung Eater, he'll give the player the key to his prison. The prison
  <strong>
  </strong>
  can then be found in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds under Leyndell, Royal Capital. Players can kill Dung Eater right away for his armor and sword, but this will forfeit his quest. Finishing his quest by giving him five Seedbed Curses will still grant players the armor, but this approach can span up to late-game.

  Statistically, this is the best armor set in

  . It's also the heaviest, which is a fair trade-off for something so defensively whole. This armor set has the highest Poise value in the game, as well as the best physical damage mitigation. It also has the best lightning resistance out of all armor.

  </span>
  , who is located in the Ruin-Strewn Precipice (the northernmost tip of the lake in Liurnia of the Lakes). Once players have killed Makar or if they have killed Makar prior, they can simply go back to the creature's boss arena and Great Horned Tragoth's invasion sign should be visible on the floor. He'll drop the

 <p>
  With
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  confirmed to be in production for some time, it's safe to say that the development process and reception around
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is highly likely to have an impact on the studio's next major sci-fi outing. In a genre known for how the distribution of party members can set the tone for an entire experience, it might be best for
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  to take a completely different route when compared to
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  's seemingly streamlined cast.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  There are unlikely to be more concrete details arising about the next
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  for a while given the entire hype and release cycle for
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  which is brewing, with it even being possible that the studio is biding its time on
  <em>
   ME
  </em>
  . As the shift towards action and away from tactics has continued with each
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  title, the next game is set to mirror
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  more than ever by limiting the player to being accompanied by two party members who cannot be directly controlled. While this reflects an emphasis on intimacy when paired with the smaller number of characters, overall, it might be wise for
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  to diverge from this trend in one key way for the sake of its lore.

  </em>
  had four out of nine, so
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  seems to be quite predictably following this pattern of ratio. When considering the expanded Tevinter setting of
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  and the epic lore of Thedas that has been set up over the past few years, however, it's understandable that some players were instead expecting bolder representation of the world's fantasy races.

  There are multiple races who have never been featured as companions despite their relevance in the galaxy, and the post-Reaper setting of
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  could be a great environment for leaning into those more novel species options. It could be argued that
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  's tighter set of more familiar demographics allowed for more exploration of each character, but repeating the same dynamic in the studio's next big release might leave fans feeling burnt out. It's a lot harder to imagine players expressing more enthusiasm about yet another human soldier in the next
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  when the likes of Batarians, Vorcha, Volus, and even Hanar are still on the table.

  It's seen by many as the peak of the trilogy overall, and
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2
  </em>
  's massive party size has generally played a large role in that assessment. With 12 companions each featuring a unique loyalty-earning mission, their diversity shines through regardless of some being less developed. This number of characters inevitably led to some being lackluster, but attempting a similar, or even greater scale, moving forward would have the benefit of hindsight in that department and could help lay the foundation for a new era of

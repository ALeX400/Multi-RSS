 <p>
  <em>

  brought college football gaming back with some exciting new features. The CampusIQ system changes player ratings based on how they perform in real life, while the
  <em>

  Wear &amp; Tear system adds realism by simulating player fatigue and injuries over the season. With over 130 teams and real player likenesses, the game also includes popular modes like Dynasty Mode and Road to Glory. These features have made
  <em>

  a major player in sports gaming for 2024, but the developer isn’t stopping there. EA continues to keep the game updated to ensure it stays relevant.

      <title>15 Most Realistic Looking Players In EA FC 25, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  With each new iteration of
  <em>
   EA FC
  </em>
  (ever since it was called
  <em>
   FIFA
  </em>
  ), the gameplay mechanics continue to evolve and transform. Whether it's refined ball physics or more tactical depth, the boundaries of realism continue to be stretched. However, it's not just the gameplay that EA focuses on, as the graphics have also seen some remarkable improvements over the years.

 <p>
  Considering that
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  boasts a plethora of superstars, it's no surprise that EA would want them looking as close to photo-realistic as possible. Player models continue to become more detailed, as each rendition of the title enhances the authenticity of the visuals. With such realistic graphics and fluid gameplay, the in-game immersion is at an all-time high.

  Despite now playing in the Saudi Pro League, Cristiano Ronaldo remains one of the most recognizable people on the planet, and he's been the poster boy for countless
  <em>
   FIFAs
  </em>
  in the past. It's no shock then that EA ensured his player model captured his likeness with incredible precision.

  The attention to detail extends past his sharp facial features and iconic hairstyle, as the designers managed to capture his presence on the pitch too. If any
  <em>

  players play against a team with Ronaldo in it, they'll immediately recognize him as easily on the virtual pitch as they would in reality.

 <p>
  One of Arsenal's most expensive ever signings, Declan Rice is widely regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League, and perhaps even the world. A player of that caliber must've been high on EA's priority list to render well, and it's fair to say that they succeeded.

 <p>
  Rice's signature look, including his intense focus and serious expressions during matches, have all been captured. He's the standout of the Arsenal team when it comes to realistic renders, and his dominant presence on the pitch is there to match.

 <p>
  It's clear that the Saudi Pro League aims to be one of the most competitive leagues in the world, and they've been acquiring a lot of elite footballers to match their ambition. Thus, with such a large group of recognizable talent, it makes sense that EA put such effort into rendering their models so accurately, with N'Golo Kanté being one of the standouts.

 <p>
  After almost a decade in the Premier League and a wealth of trophies to show for his time there, Kante became known for his wide smile and tireless work ethic. EA's designers have managed to capture what made him stand out as a player incredibly well, as his clean-cut appearance reflects the humble and hardworking persona he became known for.

  The French forward has rocked a variety of hairstyles across the years, and EA's always made an effort to capture their likeness in his virtual rendition. In the latest entry to the franchise, Griezmann has ditched the bleached blonde and curls, but he still remains as recognizable as ever.

  Leverkusen shocked the world in the 23/24 season when they ran away with the Bundesliga title undefeated, toppling a dynasty that Bayern Munich had ruled for the past decade. One of the team's most important players to their success was Jeremie Frimpong, and he's arguably as invaluable in the game too.

 <p>
  His development to being one of the best right-backs in the world was clearly worthy of some special treatment by EA, as his facial rendering is fantastic. His distinctive appearance and coiled hair make him one of the more notable players for Bayer Leverkusen, and his in-game look matches that with ease.

  There's a strong argument to be made that Son Heung-Min is the best Asian player to ever grace world football, with his fame and status preceding him. He's a Korean icon and is regularly featured in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC
  </em>
  marketing material, so his resemblance in-game has to be strong to match that.

 <p>
  Well, he's clearly the focal point of marketing for a reason, as his model looks stunningly realistic, especially in motion on the pitch. When Sonny scores and pulls out his iconic picture celebration, it's as if players are watching him live in the Premier League.

  Barcelona have been incredibly trusting in their youth for the past few seasons, and one player who's grown to be one of the more constant and reliable members of the team is Jules Koundé. His versatility across the back line, alongside his speed and defending, make him a great pick for any player.

 <p>
  He doesn't just bring a touch of class to the team though, as his player model helps increase the immersion for anyone using him in-game. Considering he plays among some popular young stars, his photo-realistic likeness might go under the radar slightly, but he's certainly one of the best player models in the game.

 <p>
  Though he may not be classed as one of the best players the game has to offer anymore, it's indisputable that Lionel Messi is one of the best footballers to ever kick a ball. With such a high reputation and a strong history in the
  <em>
   Fifa
  </em>
  franchise, EA knew from the get-go they'd have to get his player model right.

 <p>
  Unsurprisingly, they did just that, as Messi's ability to glide across the pitch has been rendered to near perfection. His face scan is unquestionably iconic, and any player who uses him in-game is bound to be swept up in nostalgia for his domination in titles past.

  Even though the Real Madrid team is packed full of superstars, if there's one player that is a must for any starting 11 it's Mbappé. His electric pace and unreal shooting make him the highest-rated player in the game, and with such prestige comes an excellent face scan to boot.

 <p>
  Anyone playing Ultimate Team dreams of having him in their team, and for those that have him in their lineup, he's immediately the stand-out star. Even though he'll be a priority for high-quality rendering for years to come, it's unclear how EA can begin to improve for future iterations when he already looks almost picture-perfect.

 <p>
  There are few players out there with a passing range like Trent Alexander-Arnold, and ever since he came through the Liverpool academy he's been a staple in the first team. Not only that, but he's a well-sought-after player in Ultimate Team too, so EA always ensures that his player model is up to scratch.

 <p>
  This year is no different, and Trent's model is by far one of the most recognizable the game has to offer. All players need to do is look at the player, and they'll know a killer pass is coming their way.

  As if being in the typical starting 11 for Liverpool FC wasn't enough, Diogo Jota also felt the need to be an excellent gamer. Back in 2021, Jota was ranked as the world's number 1
  <em>
   Fifa 21
  </em>
  player, and ever since then, he's regularly seen grinding Champs on the weekend just like any other
  <em>
   EA FC
  </em>
  player would.

  Luckily for him, if he were to ever select himself for his Ultimate Team, he might mistake the screen for looking in a mirror. EA has done a superb job at recreating his likeness, with the additional blemishes and freckles only adding to the realism.

  Haaland's taken the Premier League by storm and he's easily one of the best strikers in the world, with many fans claiming he's a robot due to his remarkable athletic capabilities. However, despite the jokes, he is in fact human and EA worked hard to get his resemblance in the game just right.

 <p>
  It's not just his chiseled face and scrunched-up hair that they managed to replicate, as the developers have even simulated his colossal build and powerful running style. If there's a striker running at a player's defense, they'll know immediately that it's the Norwegian powerhouse.

  Any Liverpool fan will tell you that Van Dijk's been the key to their recent success, and it'd be hard to disagree. He's still arguably one of the best center-backs in the world and an icon of world football.

 <p>
  EA has always made a special effort to reflect his imposing figure in-game, and this year they smashed it. He's a titan to come across on the pitch, and his towering figure paired with his defined facial features make him one of the most realistic depictions of a player put to screen.

  Every angle of his face has been carefully mapped, and the way he plays in-game only adds to the realism that his player exudes. His model is a testament to the visual strength that

  Sometimes they may need to use one of their many Swim Morphs to cross a large body of water, and sometimes they’ll make use of a Glide Morph to soar through the air. However, the largest portion of their time will be spent on foot and in a Dash Morph form.

  's Absolute Doom has easily been the most content-heavy season of Chapter 5. The season has brought players a plethora of Marvel collaborations, mythic items, the Day of Doom LTM, and a quest storyline that will soon culminate with an in-game event on Saturday, October 5 at 2 PM ET. Though the ongoing Marvel season won't technically end until November 2,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  will start shifting its focus away from Doctor Doom this month as the game unleashes its annual Fortnitemares celebration.

  Fortnitemares is
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's yearly Halloween update and brings with it new gameplay items, seasonal map decorations, the Horde Rush mode, and spooky crossover cosmetics. Previous Fortnitemares events have seen characters like Frankenstein's Monster, Ash Williams, and Jack Skellington board the battle bus. While Epic has yet to officially confirm the contents of this October's update, a recent leak showcased some surprising collaborations, a revamped location for Battle Royale, and more.

  A new update on October 1 added several files to the game in preparation for Fortnitemares. Leakers investigated as soon as the update launched and quickly revealed the files' contents. The most noticeable leak came in the form of a new piece of key art via iFireMonkey on X. The art shows off seven unreleased skins, including three new crossover skins.

  Every New Fortnite Crossover Skin
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the past, Fortnite has added plenty of skins from R-rated franchises like the Xenomorph, the Predator, and the Terminator. However, last year's Fortnitemares saw the game add its first serial killer skin with Michael Myers from the
  <em>
   Halloween
  </em>
  series. Evidently, that skin did well, as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  will supposedly collaborate with
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  next.

  Leaks claim both franchises will have at least one skin in the new update: Billy the Puppet for
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  and Leatherface for
  <em>
   The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  . The characters' inclusions are quite a shock given

  's family-friendly image — Leatherface is literally wearing the skin of one of his victims, after all — but it's exciting news for horror fans nonetheless. Leatherface also looks to have a harvesting tool in the form of his iconic chainsaw, but it's unknown if this can be purchased separately or only in a bundle with Leatherface himself. Outside the realm of horror, a new Halloween-themed Marshmello skin can be seen in the leaked key art too. Given the popularity of the original Marshmello

  Three other crossover skins will likely appear in Fortnite this October. According to several posts from iFireMonkey, a second batch of
  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  skins is coming and will include Sally and a Pumpkin King variant of Jack Skellington. A new Marvel skin for Mephisto should also be coming soon. In addition to leaks, this fiendish villain has been teased by Epic through the recent Ghost Ri-Durrr skin's loading screen and in the forge at Castle Doom.

  This year's Fortnitemares still has some spooky takes on the game's original skins for players uninterested in the aforementioned collaborations. Knightmare, Pumpkin Knight, Phantom Guff, and what looks to be a witch version of the Princess Lexa Fortnite Crew skin are all shown off in the key art. Other skins like Shadow Monks and Dark Ruby were found in the game's files as well.

  Besides purchasable cosmetics, the Battle Royale map will be getting its usual Halloween makeover. As can be seen in the leaked key art, Mount Olympus will soon be overtaken by vines and massive pumpkins. Mount Olympus felt bland to many after the Zeus mythics and NPC were removed at the end of Chapter 5 Season 2, so this refresh could incentivize players to explore the Northeast quarter of the island.

  When it comes to the loot pool, the wood stake shotgun, pumpkin launcher, and witch broom are all returning this year. The leaker HYPEX stated in a post on X that a
  <em>
   Saw
  </em>
  -based mythic can also be obtained by players. The item is called "Boom Billy" and will be a deployable version of Billy the Puppet on his iconic tricycle. The puppet will follow an enemy player, ask them if they "want to play a game," and then explode when within a certain vicinity of the enemy.

  Even if these leaks have uncovered all that there is to know about the upcoming Fortnitemares, it looks like players will have plenty to check out in the game this October. Many fans complained about 2023's Fortnitemares update due to its focus on cosmetics rather than playable content. While this year will still be adding quite a few items to the in-game store, the return of Horde Rush in conjunction with the Battle Royale changes should hopefully make this Fortnitemares an improvement over last year's event. Fortnitemares will begin on October 15 according to leakers.

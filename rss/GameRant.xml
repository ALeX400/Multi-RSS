  One of the most often-asked questions about animal companions in video games is if players can pet them.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  illustrates that this remains true, even when that animal companion is a deity like the adorable foxlike Enki.

  When talking with
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  ’s lead narrative designer Daniel Baider, Game Rant, of course, had to ask if players could pet the cute divine companion that joins Nor Vanek on her journey. Teasingly, Baider’s answer was more than a simple yes or no.

  Can You Pet the God?

 <p>
  Enki has become a fairly popular character even before the game’s release. He’s taken Twitter by storm, and he’s been jokingly called the game’s actual protagonist by his growing legions of fans. No small part of this is the character’s rich personality packed into a cute fox companion for
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  protagonist Nor Vanek. And Enki is very important to Nor’s journey. He enables her magic and traversal mechanics, as well as being her guide to the various gods she will encounter on her journey. While he's cute and offers all of this, Enki at his core is very much a divine being. As Baider explained, that means that he has a very strong opinion on whether or not he should get pets.

 <p>
  Ultimately, it does seem like a fair position for a god. While getting pets is a form of praise, gods in general tend to prefer their praise to be more of the reverent worship kind, after all. Enki has a strong sympathy for humankind, so he may not be demanding worship (which may be willingly given by some). Still, he is a god and a dedicated pet button could feel diminishing to him. However, Baider left the door open for another option.

  He did say Enki wouldn’t willingly subject himself to such indignity–not that he doesn’t suffer such indignity. Baider doesn't say that it never happens in
  <em>

  </em>
  's story, meaning somewhere among its runtime, fans may still see some pets. Baider didn’t rule out this possibility, but he didn’t confirm it either:

 <p>
  Despite their reputation, Soulslike/Souls-lite games can be rather funny from time to time, and it certainly would be funny to see the furry god have to endure fawning pets from Nor or others on occasion in the story. After all, the relationship between Enki and Nor is the beating heart of the game, so enriching it with humor would do a lot to endear that companionship to players if executed well. In fact, from that perspective, a dedicated pet button would somewhat cheapen the significance of such a moment.

   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an open-world survival game that grants players the freedom to build their own territory, explore the open world, and take on terrifying bosses to progress through the game's story. This free-to-play game gives players quite a lot to dive into, and although players will never be alone when joining a public server for their first playthrough, they can also match up with friends and survive together.

  . From here, players will be presented with the channel settings, each of which can be toggled to control what messages show up in the
  <strong>
   <em>

  text chat. These settings are as follows:

 <p>
  For players who want to disable all in-game chatter altogether,
  <strong>
   setting each channel to Off is the best option

  . However, if players still want to receive messages from individuals who are part of their team, Hive, or Warband, they can keep those channels open and disable only the System, Regional, and World channels.

   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3

  developer Larian Studios has shared that the game's streak of consecutive industry wins started to affect development, pushing the studio to opt for a certain strategy when attending award ceremonies. Over the past year,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  Larian Studios released
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  in August 2023 and was instantly met with waves of positive reviews, mirroring the game's highly successful early access period in 2020. The

  -inspired RPG received a perfect score from multiple critics, selling millions of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  copies in the process. In the following months, the game was showered with countless accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards. While this attention helped the studio's popularity, it also introduced some tough challenges.

  In an interview with Edge (via GamesRadar), Larian Studios CEO and
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  director Swen Vincke expressed his appreciation for the studio being bestowed with various awards, but explained that the sheer number of award ceremonies to be attended "affects development." Upon sensing that the scintillating success of the fantasy RPG would mean getting awards at several different events, he said that the studio devised a strategy of "rotating teams" according to which "different people went to different award shows."

  Discussing how Larian devs often had to quickly prepare to receive another award at a different ceremony as soon as they had finished at another, Vincke said that the magnitude of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's success came close to being "too much." The game director further revealed that he would prefer a one-and-done event instead, explaining that it "would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time" as he views the current format as something that is "surprisingly draining on the soul." Moreover, Vincke stated how the continued popularity of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  has made Larian devs "more emotional" as they are unable to find closure, which he states is a desirable thing at the end of such a major project.

  Game development is a long and complex endeavor, which sometimes sees devs bending over backwards to meet tight deadlines and engaging in 'crunch' as release windows approach. It's understandable how frequent award ceremony appearances could start becoming an impediment to a studio's day-to-day business. However, the
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  team's balancing act seems to be working, as the studio's workers continues to travel to award shows while teasing fans about the state of forthcoming Larian Studios games.

  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  , legendary weapons belong to a special class of armaments that often
  <strong>
   feature unique designs and skills
  </strong>
  . Sometimes, these weapons also include unique lore that helps players piece together the game's mysterious plot. While the base game includes nine unique legendary weapons, the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC introduces four more.

   Ancient Meteoric Ore Greatsword
  </span>
  can be obtained from the furnace in the Ancient Ruins of Starfall Past. The ruins are located
  <strong>
   southwest of the Moorth Ruins Site of Grace
  </strong>
  . The legendary greatsword scales well with Strength and Dexterity.

  Besides the incredible raw damage output, the weapon's unique skill,

   White Light Charge, also deals magic damage

  without requiring Intelligence or Faith. Since the weapon can be found relatively early in the game, you can rely on it for the majority of the DLC after upgrading it to +10.

   Sword of Darkness

  is a
  <strong>
   legendary straight sword
  </strong>
  that you can acquire after finding the Stone Sheathed Sword in one of the three unique altars in the Shadow Realm. You can find these three altars in the following locations:

   : Behind the temple blocked by an inactive Furnace Golem.

  Once you have the Stone Sheathed Sword in your inventory, you can
  <strong>
   visit the second altar to transform the weapon into the Sword of Darkness
  </strong>
  . Activating the weapon's unique skill causes the Tarnished to raise the weapon in the air, releasing a gust of darkness that swivels around,
  <strong>
   dealing holy damage to all enemies caught in it, while negating holy damage to self
  </strong>
  .

  The weapon comes equipped with a unique skill called Light. When executing the skill, the Tarnished raises the weapon in the air, following which,
  <strong>
   rays of blinding light emanate from the weapon
  </strong>
  . Using the weapon skill also temporarily boosts the Tarnished's holy attacks.

  The Euporia Twinblade deals holy damage, and when it strikes enemies, the blades emit a radiant glow, boosting its holy damage output. Its unique skill, Euporia Vortex, enables the Tarnished to spin the blades in front of them,

  At a convention panel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  producer and director Naoki Yoshida stated his interest in bringing 24-player Savage raids to
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  as part of new exploration zone content. While no further information was given, the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  lead stated that the planning portion of the new adventuring foray had wrapped up, and the programming phase was underway.

 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail
  </em>
  , the fifth expansion for Square Enix's critically acclaimed MMORPG, brought the game's first major graphical update and a slew of new content for players to participate in. Between leveling the new Viper and Pictomancer combat Jobs, and taking on two new Extreme Trials at level 100,
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  has been praised by players for its challenging combat and encounter design. Players looking for more fights to take on will not have long to wait, as Patch 7.01 will see the first four rounds of the Arcadion 8-player raid series released on Normal difficulty, alongside Job balance updates. On July 30, Patch 7.05 will allow players to challenge the first Arcadion Savage raid tier.

  With the upcoming Savage raid tier right around the corner, Yoshida took time to give raid-focused players a glimpse into future content. During an interview with the French-language website Millenium.org, Yoshida teased that a 24-player Savage raid in the game's upcoming exploration zone was among the things he expressed interest in bringing to the table. While further details about the Shades' Triangle exploration zone remained light, Yoshida confirmed that the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  development team looked at things from the previous adventuring forays, Bozja and Eureka, and took the best of both to implement in Shades' Triangle. Yoshida said that the new exploration zone would be available in increments, starting in the Patch 7.2 update series.

  During the Bozja adventuring forays, a raid called Delubrum Reginae was released in Patch 5.45, with both Normal and Savage difficulty options. The Savage version allows for 24 to 48 players to join in, and a Cerberus mount is the reward for players who complete it. During the same interview session with French media, Yoshida discussed the ways he wants to keep
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  character progression interesting in future expansions. With
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  's launch, the level cap was raised to 100.

 <p>
  Yoshida said that the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  development team is looking into seeing if additional Job complexity or an entirely new skill system can be added in future releases. Between requests for additional player and NPC interactions and the confirmed combat-focused updates, only time will tell what Square Enix will do to keep players engaged.

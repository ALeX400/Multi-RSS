  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has recently devised an amazing Kalosian variant for Meganium. This fan art celebrates the upcoming release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , which is set in Lumiose City, located in Kalos, and has been exciting fans of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise after more information about the title was revealed recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Grass-type Meganium is the last evolution of Chikorita, which evolves into Bayleef starting at Level 16, and finally into its ultimate form at Level 32 or more. These critters were originally introduced as one of the three starters in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  and are set to return in the next game of the franchise. A few weeks ago, the starters of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  were revealed, marking the comeback of the Gen 2 Chikorita and Totodile as well as the Gen 5 Tepig as the initial picks in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan called Fast-Sliggoo shared a Kalosian variant for Meganium. In this new Grass/Dark-type form, the critter is depicted with darker colors and a black head. Also, instead of having a huge pink flower around its neck, the Kalosian Meganium seems to be covered in withered leaves. The new take on the creature was appreciated by other fans, which gave Fast-Sliggoo over 1,700 upvotes.

  Fan Creates Kalosian Meganium to Celebrate the Upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A
 </h2>
 <p>
  Due to its prominence in the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  , Meganium has been fairly popular in fan art during the last few weeks. For example, one fan recently created another regional variant for Meganium, imagining a flying version of the dinosaur-like critter, which had its flower become butterfly-like wings.

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  In another unique artwork, another fan created an Alolan variant for Meganium, which had the Grass/Poison type. In this original design, the Alolan Meganium had pale yellow skin and the plant around its neck was an anthurium flower, which is known for being toxic to animals such as cats, dogs, and horses in real life.
 </p>
 <p>
  While multiple fans have already designed regional variants for Meganium, others have picked different concepts instead. One example was shared with the community a few weeks ago: a Mega Evolution for Meganium. This new form reimagined the critter as a huge yellow dinosaur-like creature with a bright flower around its neck and huge brown spikes, as well as sharp claws. Hopefully, these artworks and the upcoming release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will inspire even more fans to come up with unique designs for other popular monsters and share them with the community.

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  Main Storyline might drive mad players due to its strange Objective system that has players running around completing secondary quests and switching between Naoe and Yasuke. And
  <em>
   <strong>
    Lady of Whispers
   </strong>
  </em>
  , can be particularly confusing since players will need to switch to Yasuke to be able to start it.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Finding Lady Nene can also be tricky. So, in this guide, players will find the exact location of Lady Nene in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows,
  </em>
  as well as other information important to finish this quest and progress along Yasuke's path.

  After completing

  , players will receive a series of objectives for both Naoe and Yasuke as part of the content players need to unlock before progressing down the Main Storyline.
 </p>
 <p>
  One such quest is Lady Of Whispers, which will send Yasuke on a mission to find Lady Nene, Lord Hideyoshi's wife and a potential ally. So the next step to complete this mission will be to meet her at the designated location.

  Most mission objectives in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  are purposely hidden to force players to use the Scout mechanic. Still, before wasting Scout charges like crazy, it is always good to pay attention to the general description of how to find the objective. To find Lady Nene, players are given three clues:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   She is in Omi
  </li>
  <li>
   She is at the castle in Azuchi
  </li>
  <li>
   She lives in the Hideyoshi residence
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, open the map and draw a straight line from Sakamoto (Left of Lake Biwa, the biggest lake in the game, where the Cat Island is) to the opposite shore to find Azuchi. Then, scout the zone to pinpoint the Quest location marker.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, grab a horse or a boat and cross to the other side of the lake. If players have already unlocked Okishima's fast travel, they will be able to find a boat there, which will reduce the travel time considerably.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that for this quest, players must have Yasuke as the active character, otherwise, they won't be able to complete it. Follow the direction of the Quest Marker to find a servant lady surrounded by enemy Samurai. It's time to do some cleanup, then, after the battle, talk to the servant to receive another Quest Marker for the actual meeting spot to encounter Lady Nene.
 </p>
 <p>
  By traveling to this point on the map, players will also be able to find another quest marker that they can trigger later to continue another of Yasuke's personal missions. After the long cutscene, players will talk to Lady Nene in the present and arrange for a new series of tasks that Yasuke needs to complete to progress further in his adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important to mention that if players have the Canon Mode activated, some of the choices in this quest will be automatically picked. Except those involving romance options, which are always up to the player's choice.

Naoe watches her father die at the hands of a small army of masked warriors that she eventually learns are part of a secret organization called the Shinbakufu. Alongside the samurai-turned-ronin Yasuke, Naoe hunts down the Shinbakufu members one by one, claiming revenge with each kill and searching for the missing artifact that her father asked her to keep safe.

  The obvious benefit of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' flashbacks is that they do a great job of fleshing out the game's setting, character relationships, and character backstories. These flashbacks often contain some really touching moments between Naoe and her loved ones, and give key pieces of lore that fans won't want to miss.

  Assassin's Creed Shadows' Flashbacks Can Be a Jarring Break in Pace
 </h3>
 <p>
  But while the material inside
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' flashbacks is generally worthwhile, their actual placement during the game's story leaves a lot to be desired. Some of
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  ' most jarring flashbacks are those that reference story moments that players first witnessed only a few minutes ago. These sequences – no matter how brief – often feel as though the game is needlessly retreading old ground, which can become quite frustrating given
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' lengthy runtime.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' flashbacks also lack consistency in their placement in the timeline. During
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  ' opening hours, players will jump rapidly through time, seeing events that occurred several months, and then several years before the main events of the story. These frequent and sudden shifts can also be very jarring, and can feel like an unnecessary break in the game's pacing.
 </p>
 <h3 id="many-of-assassin-39-s-creed-shadows-39-flashbacks-feel-like-they-39-re-in-the-wrong-place">
  Many of Assassin's Creed Shadows' Flashbacks Feel Like They're in the Wrong Place
 </h3>
 <p>
  Along with being a roadblock during
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' story, many of the game's flashback sequences feel as though they would have benefited the overarching narrative much more if they were just presented chronologically. The backstories of both protagonists are the best examples of this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naoe's backstory is a fairly interesting one, with her flashback sequences revolving around her shinobi training at the hands of her father, Nagato, and the real-world ninjutsu mentor, Momochi Sandayu. The problem is that these flashback sequences are tied to optional open-world activities, and if players don't engage in all of them before certain main story missions, then some key moments aren't going to have as much of an emotional impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, if players don't complete all of Naoe's Kuji-kiri activities by the time she meets Yasuke, the revelation that he was the one who killed her mentor Momochi won't hit players nearly as hard, as they've only seen the character once before that point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yasuke's flashback sequences are similarly problematic. Ubisoft made the decision to withhold Yasuke's backstory until the final few missions of the game, and given the lack of any major revelation, the decision feels rather odd. If Yasuke's backstory was presented to players at the start of the game, it would make his fascination with the Assassins much more understandable, and make his quest for revenge feel more earned.

Nintendo's beloved "Direct" broadcasts have become some of the most highly-anticipated events in gaming, with the developer sharing tons of new information about new and upcoming games. Directs have hosted some of Nintendo's biggest reveals ever, including the first showcases of games like
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . Now, the most recent broadcast has set a new record for the gaming juggernaut.
 </p>
 <p>
  The March 2025 Nintendo Direct was filled with plenty of exciting announcements about upcoming Switch games, including multiple major Nintendo properties. The presentation featured some of the first gameplay reveals for the highly-anticipated
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4 Beyond
  </em>
  , showing off the new
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  's stunning graphics and Samus' newfound psychic powers. Nintendo also showcased several brand-new titles, including the exciting return of the
  <em>
   Tomodachi Life
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rhythm Heaven
  </em>
  franchises later this year. A new report now reveals that Nintendo's recent Direct was one of its biggest yet.
 </p>
 <p>
  As reported by StreamsCharts, Nintendo's March 2025 Direct set a new record for the Japanese developer while also being one of its biggest showcases yet. Nintendo's March Direct officially broke the record for "most concurrent viewers" on Nintendo's official Japanese YouTube channel, with more than 1.1 million viewers simultaneously watching at its peak. The Nintendo Direct also made history as one of Nintendo's most-viewed Directs of all-time, finishing in third-place among Direct broadcasts with a peak of over 2.7 million viewers.

  The March 2025 Direct's impressive performance rocketed the official Nintendo broadcast ahead of several of its peers. Nintendo's March 2025 Direct currently stands as the most-viewed gaming showcase throughout the first three months of 2025, topping both the "Pokemon Day" livestream and Sony's February 2025 "State of Play" broadcast among others. The Nintendo Direct's third-place finish falls just behind the Nintendo's E3 2021 Direct, which first revealed
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom,
  </em>
  and the June 2024 Direct, which revealed both
  <em>

  and
  <em>

  With all the excitement surrounding the March 2025 Direct, Nintendo is far from done with its major new reveals. Nintendo already has its next Direct on the way next week, with an April 2 broadcast focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 as the developer's next console. Nintendo is expected to not only give more details about the hardware for its upcoming new console, but also showcase some of the first games set to debut on the Switch 2. Nintendo fans look to have even more exciting updates on the way as Nintendo prepares to pull back the curtain on its next home console.

  Alex Mercer was never an outright good guy per se, taking on the role of the anti-hero in the first
  <em>
   Prototype
  </em>
  game. However, by the time the second game came out, his faith in humanity had been completely extinguished.
 </p>
 <p>
  This turned him into
  <em>
   Prototype 2
  </em>
  's villain, who wanted to release the Blacklight virus on all of humanity and force them to evolve. However, this would come at a drastic cost given the near 100% fatality rate of this virus, which is why the protagonist, James Heller, must stop Alex's diabolical plan from being carried out by any means necessary.

  Blizzard is a company known for its amazing character writing, and this can be witnessed from the very first
  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  game. Sarah Kerrigan was a powerful Ghost who was thrown to the wolves by her commander, causing her to be captured and infected by the Zerg.
 </p>
 <p>
  This forces a heel turn upon her as she becomes the leader of the Zerg and strives for galactic domination. Her compelling story has turned Kerrigan into one of the most iconic video game characters of all time.

  Tommy Vercetti is a go-getter who makes an empire of his own in
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  after being released from prison. His partner, Lance Vance, is a fun character to hang out with, but he barely does anything to help build up this empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  After complaining that he isn't getting his due credit from Tommy despite doing little to nothing to help expand the business, he decides to side with Sonny and betrays Tommy in a shocking moment near the tail end of
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  . This prompts a firefight between the duo that ends with Lance's death.

  After the diabolical events of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 10
  </em>
  , Raiden decides to take strict and preventive action against any possible threats to Earthrealm. While this sentiment came from a good place, his attempts to reverse the corruption of the Jinsei caused him to walk down a path of evil in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  It didn't help that he started relying on Shinnok's powerful yet evil amulet to get his way, making most of Earthrealm's heroes question his actions. Thankfully, he sees the light sooner rather than later and reverts to the good side in the nick of time.

  Cortana is one of the most iconic characters in video game history, with this AI helping Master Chief time and time again during his adventures. Players assumed that her story had ended after she sacrificed herself in
  <em>
   Halo 4
  </em>
  , only for her to make a return in the sequel.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, she appears as a corrupted villain this time who wants to rule the galaxy by any means necessary. While her decision to become evil was met with mixed reception by the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  faithful, there's no denying that fighting against Cortana herself makes for a tantalizing setup to the plot of
  <em>
   Halo 5: Guardians
  </em>
  .

  There was a time when Arthas Menethil was a paladin everyone looked up to, who served the side of good and tried to stop the threat of the Scourge by any means necessary. However, in his desperation, he tried to use a forbidden and evil power for his own good and succumbed to the darkness inside him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking on the power of the blade, Frostmourne cemented his fate after his soul was stolen by this cursed weapon. He eventually became the Lich King himself, turning into one of the most legendary antagonists in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  that players banded to defeat in the
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  expansion.

  Sephiroth is one of the most diabolical and entertaining video game villains of all time, but there was a time when he could've been classified as the good guy. However, after entering Nibelheim and finding Professor Hojo's secret experiments, the SOLDIER uncovers the truth of his existence as the perfect being manufactured with the use of Jenova's cells.
 </p>
 <p>
  This revelation broke his mind and caused him to raze Nibelheim to the ground before merging into the Lifestream with Jenova. It's a chilling origin story for a villain who wants to raze the Planet with Meteor and become a god in the process.

  Re-joining the Grove Street Families and helping this gang establish its dominance in the early going makes for a great introduction to the story of
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  , but fans have no idea what's in store for them. After CJ decides to humor Cesar and participate in a stakeout with him, he finds out that both Big Smoke and Ryder have been working in close capacity with C.R.A.S.H.
 </p>
 <p>
  This shocking revelation makes for one of the biggest betrayals in video game history, culminating in Sweet's arrest and CJ essentially being evicted from Los Santos. It's not until he travels the rest of San Andreas and gathers some valuable allies that he manages to return to the city and take his revenge on the people who made his life a living hell.

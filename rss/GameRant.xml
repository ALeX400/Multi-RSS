  When thinking about characters from the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic the Hedgehog
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise, most people will go straight to either the humans or the anthropomorphic animals. However, over the course of this long-running series, several robots have also become fully-fledged characters rather than just being one of the many Egg-Bots that appear as little more than lowly grunts of Eggman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering these machines are built to obey and carry out orders rather than have their own personal ambitions or motives, it can lead to some pretty interesting character arcs. On the other hand, a robot also needs to have a cool and unique design to become memorable, and thankfully, there are many that suit the description across the
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  series. This is how the robots of
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  match up when taking into account their relevance to the wider story, development, and design.

  Considering the first version of Mecha Sonic hasn't been seen since the second game in the series, he's not exactly a fan favorite, but still a fairly memorable boss nonetheless. Before the bots' appearances would get all flashy with colors and extra details, Mecha Sonic kept it simple with a silver metallic design that is fairly stripped back and traditional, but still eye-catching.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mecha Sonic's very existence would also give fans a glimpse into Eggman's attempts to create his own version of Sonic, way before Metal Sonic was even introduced to the series. Overall, an interesting robot that maybe could have been a little higher with a more intriguing design and story.

  Cubot and Orbot are an odd duo who seemed as though they were a random addition to
  <em>
   Sonic Colors
  </em>
  , but to many people's surprise, they've become mainstays in the series. These two clumsy robots can always be seen by Eggman's side, willing to carry out any of his demands, no matter how outlandish they may be. Since the two aren't fighters, it means Cubot and Orbot are largely treated like comic relief in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  While they don't receive much of any development, they do help to lighten the mood now and again. Most recently, in
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , they task Shadow with collecting special parts across the map to fuel their rocket, only to reveal that, once all the parts have been acquired, the rocket is little more than a coo-coo clock. These two little guys are extremely entertaining whenever they show up, though they usually only receive a small cameo here and there.

  Emerl is a mysterious character who would first debut in
  <em>
   Sonic Battle
  </em>
  . Though he initially seemed like a quirky robot, once his backstory starts becoming revealed, it's clear that this single Gizmoid is incredibly important to the lore. Emerl was created by the ones only known as the "Fourth Great Civilization," who turned him into the ultimate combat machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Emerl himself is already fascinating in both backstory and design, an alternate version of the bot named Gemerl would show up later in
  <em>
   Sonic Advance 3
  </em>
  after being born out of Emerl's combat data, thanks to Eggman. While Emerl is a fairly niche character, his introduction to the story adds a lot to the wider universe of the franchise.

  After Sonic and Tails managed to deal with the first Mecha Sonic, they eventually stumble into a bigger, spikier, and overall more dangerous iteration of the bot during the third game. Mecha Sonic Mk 2 has a downright stunning design, with the long hair talons and a single visor making him look like a genuinely evil version of the series' protagonist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mecha Sonic Mk 2 demands the player's attention any time he shows up on the screen, and when he finally unleashes his Super form, it makes for a terrifying moment that every longtime player will remember. While Mecha Sonic Mk 2 doesn't get quite as much love from Sonic Team as some of the other bots and is fairly light on the development of backstory, it's hard not to still admire him for the design alone.

  When E-123 Omega first shows up at the beginning of Team Dark's campaign in
  <em>
   Sonic Heroes
  </em>
  , he is awakened for the first time in many years after being locked away by Eggman. Because Eggman restricted Omega from entering the battlefield, making him a guardian to Shadow instead, Omega feels betrayed and ultimately becomes obsessed with seeking revenge on his master.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the course of the games, Omega has become less serious and more of a humorous character whose unique dialect and lack of emotions have led to plenty of hilarious conversations between him and Shadow. He also has one of the most unique robot designs in the series, which manages to look intimidating without appearing overly scary. While Omega has become more of a background character, he's still extremely lovable and a very welcome addition to the cast.

  By far the most recognizable robot in the entire series, and also the strongest, is Metal Sonic, the supposed "perfect" replica of the Blue Blur himself. As has been proven numerous times though, Metal Sonic just can't seem to keep up with his inspiration, as he's been defeated numerous times, though his battles are always a ton of fun to be a part of. Metal Sonic would become so popular after
  <em>
   Sonic CD
  </em>
  that it earned him a spot as the final villain of
  <em>
   Sonic Heroes
  </em>
  , where he would put his underlying powers on full display.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, his losses have also weighed heavily on Metal Sonic, whose character shows signs of being self-aware now and again. The comics, especially, have explored Metal Sonic's deep contemplation of his purpose in great depth, but the games have also managed to add plenty of intrigue to his character too, due to how frequently he shows up. This isn't even mentioning his appearance, which has become iconic for how effortlessly cool and menacing it is. It'll be interesting to see how this legendary antagonist is handled in the fourth
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  movie, but one thing is for sure, seeing him make his big-screen debut will be a real treat for all longtime fans of the series.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a big name in the PC gaming world. Much like
  <em>
   Sid Meier's Civilization
  </em>
  or the
  <em>
   Command and Conquer
  </em>
  franchises,
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  stands as a pillar of the strategy genre. It has been running for two full decades now. In that time, there have been no fewer than 16 core releases, as well as several spinoff games. Naturally, there's a lot of talk in the community about which game best represents the series and which is the
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    Total War
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of which
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  game players get into for the first time, there's no denying that these titles just have something special going for them that really resonates with fans when things just click. From the turn-based empire simulation to the real-time wars that require the best tactics possible for players to succeed, it's easy to see why the
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    Total War
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  have such a dedicated and passionate fanbase who aren't afraid to speak their minds.

   One of the greatest things about titles in this genre is that players frequently get the chance to explore expansions that bring in new characters, factions, and other interesting elements that keep complementing the gaming experience throughout the years. Turn-based strategy games might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who love them, there are plenty of choices in the Total War universe for them to satisfy the tactician within them. Moreover, the possibility of exploring several periods of history and using the different factions that fought each other at the time is very interesting and makes for an enjoyable experience.

  It was only a matter of time before the rampant popularity of the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series led the developers to try and cash in on a mobile spin-off featuring a condensed version of this gameplay loop. This led to the rise of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War Battles: Shogun
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which let players enjoy a simplified version of this title.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this gameplay loop worked on mobile, the PC port was far from successful. The game simply wasn't made for anything other than touchscreens and suffers as a result. Still, fans who want to check out a simpler, stripped-down version of what
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  is all about will find this game to be right up their alley.

  Trying to emulate the grand scale of battles in the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series to work in a real-time action format would always be a huge challenge. Despite
  <em>
   <strong>
    Spartan: Total Warrior
   </strong>
  </em>
  missing the mark in some ways, fans were still impressed to see the scale of the game's battles and how multiple enemies could be decimated with a single attack if players timed their moves properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The button-mashing gameplay never evolved all that much, which made the game feel rather mindless at times. Still, it's a fun action-oriented spin-off that fans of
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  can enjoy if they don't mind the simplistic gameplay. The power fantasy fans can enjoy with this title more than makes it worth the price of admission. As it happens with similar titles, the game first pits players against insurmountable odds by only giving them a sword, a shield, and a basic bow. However, as the story progresses, they'll be able to unlock new, more powerful weapons that can make decimating enemies and cutting them down much simpler.

  The most recent entry in the series sees Creative Assembly heading to Ancient Egypt, crafting a campaign revolving around three factions that each have a few select leaders. In some ways,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War: Pharaoh
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the franchise's more stripped-down projects in terms of units and options, which comes courtesy of the time period. Conversely, it is also among the most polished and accessible, with the game demonstrating why the IP has remained popular for decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  At its heart,
  <em>
   Pharaoh
  </em>
  is a prototypical
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  release, albeit one that has just enough novel ideas to justify its existence. Some changes are quality-of-life improvements, while others are designed to take advantage of the era's unique potential. However, the poor interface and lack of features meant that fans were less than enthused about this release.

  Most
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  games are epic sagas that last generations, letting players enjoy how things develop as the sands of time keep flowing. This grand strategy approach has worked quite well for the series time and time again, but some players didn't mind checking out a version of
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  that focused on a solitary period in history instead of trying to be as epic as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  This led to the rise of the
  <em>
   Total War Saga
  </em>
  series, which decided to reign in the series' scope to make for a more personalized, engaging, and informative experience.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War Saga: TROY
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place during the Trojan War and is a fascinating retelling of events, with the gameplay being fresh and engaging even for fans who are already well-versed in what the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series is all about.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Total War: Rome 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  narrowly lands above the joint-bottom position, though it is by far the most disappointing entry into the franchise. Following on from one of the most critically acclaimed and beloved strategy games of all time in
  <em>
   Rome: Total War
  </em>
  was never going to be easy, though not many expected to be as underwhelmed as they were.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being released nearly ten years after
  <em>
   Rome: Total War,
  </em>
  the second game suffered from numerous rudimentary issues, such as frequent technical problems and a poor camera. It was a shame, since the legacy of the first game in the series was massive, and fans were ultimately disappointed with a sequel that never lived up to the hype. That said, the game did have a somewhat decent diplomacy system, which has been revamped with a new form of artificial intelligence to make the experience more challenging in a few ways. The same goes for this title's political system, which was mostly well-developed to include various factions of Rome and Carthage in their endless struggle for power.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Empire: Total War
   </em>
  </strong>
  had a troubled launch. Players had issues with major bugs, crashes, and even install errors. Once some of those issues were patched out, though, the game's core managed to shine through.
  <em>
   Empire: Total War
  </em>
  marked a slight departure from the series formula. Since the game starts in the 18th century, players have access to a large array of artillery, cavalry units, and rifling squads. Dedicated melee units are few and far between, with each serving a specialized purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Empire
  </em>
  has a mixed reputation that has mostly stuck around, even if it is nowadays considered an OK option with heavy mod support. The base game received enough updates to be playable, but it still has underwhelming AI and a pretty unsatisfying campaign that does not compare favorably with most of the franchise's other releases. Still,
  <em>
   Empire
  </em>
  had impressive scale for its era, and for all of its historical issues, it is still worth a playthrough.

  Released in 2015,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Total War: Attila
   </strong>
  </em>
  begins in 395 AD, nine years before the birth of Attila the Hun. The game was an extremely important entry into the franchise, as it was the first release after the aforementioned
  <em>
   Total War: Rome 2.
  </em>
  Following the disappointment of the second
  <em>
   Rome
  </em>
  game put a weight of expectations on
  <em>
   Attila
  </em>
  's shoulders, as a poor release could have seen an end to the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Total War: Attila
  </em>
  was heavily praised upon release for providing one of the franchise's best overworlds, as well as offering exciting playstyle varieties with its new factions. The game had its fair share of criticism, though, particularly with its interface and technical performance. Still,
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  fans had a lot of fun with this period in history, even if the game itself could've benefited from a few months in the oven.

  As the name suggests,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Napoleon: Total War
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes place between the 18th and 19th centuries and has three campaigns following the military career of the former King of Italy and Emporer of the French, as well as a campaign allowing players to attempt to defeat Napoleon. It was a fun period in history that the game does a lot of justice to in the eyes of most fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Napoleon: Total War
  </em>
  was praised for its improved emphasis on historical accuracy and immersion, but it was also criticized for its lackluster A.I. While perhaps not a must-play in this day and age, the 2010 entry's campaign holds up well and is still pretty ambitious even all these years later. While not one of the absolute
  <strong>
   best

  ,
  <em>
   Napoleon

   <em>
    Total War: Three Kingdoms
   </em>
  </strong>
  is Creative Assembly's take on
  <em>
   a Total War
  </em>
  game set during this rich period in China's history. While it's widely considered to be
  <em>
   good
  </em>
  , many fans and critics hoped for more from the title — especially after the over-the-top
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, the
  <em>
   Mandate of Heaven
  </em>
  DLC does an excellent job of rounding out the game's core features and even adds legendary characters similar to the legendary lords from
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  . Despite falling towards the lower end of ratings for a
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  is definitely worth checking out, especially with the improvements this title received over time that addressed most major complaints.

   <em>
    Total War: Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a standalone expansion for
  <em>
   Shogun 2
  </em>
  . It added six new warring clans and three foreign imperial powers (Britain, France, and the United States) and greatly expanded the scope of
  <em>
   Shogun 2
  </em>
  's campaign map. Suffice it to say, the sheer amount of content added to this title makes it clear why some people consider it to be an excellent addition to the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series instead of a minor extension.
 </p>
 <p>
  These changes, plus the new rifling and cannon units, generally made for a more interesting campaign. Still, the game drew criticism for its lackluster ocean battles, which became more important with the addition of naval bombardment. Regardless, for a standalone expansion,
  <em>
   Fall of the Samurai
  </em>
  is one of the most impressive titles on this list.

  Following the success of the previous two
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  games, Creative Assembly and Sega teamed up once again to combine the real-time and turn-based strategy gameplay of the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series with Games Workshop's
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  universe. It may be the weakest entry in the trilogy, but that's a pretty high bar to reach for three games that pushed the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series in new and interesting directions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the gameplay in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is similar to the game's predecessors, the 2022 release makes a plethora of quality-of-life improvements that make for a more seamless playing experience while also adding an impressive range of new units that add further depth to the gameplay. The campaign takes place in the Realm of Chaos and boasts a significantly larger map than the previous
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer 3
  </em>
  was released on day one on the PC version of Game Pass, letting subscribers of Microsoft's gaming service play the new release at no extra cost.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Shogun: Total War
   </em>
  </strong>
  set the stage for the series back in 2000. At the time of its release, there just weren't that many strategy games that were as large-scale or ambitious as
  <em>
   Shogun
  </em>
  . The game's turn-based map layer and real-time strategy battles drew heavily from the likes of
  <em>
   Risk
  </em>
  and tabletop wargames.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2001, The
  <em>
   Warlord Edition
  </em>
  was released, which included
  <em>
   The Mongol Invasion
  </em>
  expansion with the base game. These updates brought with them new factions and units and a new campaign mode. For a debut title.
  <em>
   Shogun: Total War
  </em>
  did a lot of things right and set the foundation for a series that is still going strong to this day.
  <em>
   Shogun: Total War - Collection
  </em>
  is readily available nowadays, for those who want to experience this all-time classic.

     Historically,
     <em>
      Shogun: Total War
     </em>
     is among the most important entries in Sega's franchise; however, nowadays, there is little reason to play this game over, for example,

  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  seem like a match made in heaven. One is a series about tactics and war on an epic scale and the spectacle of large-scale combat. The other is pretty much the same, which combined to give fans one of the best and most imaginative Total War games to come out in quite some time. Players who were worried that the shift from actual history to fantasy wasn't going to be executed silently were happy that their worries didn't come to pass when this title was released.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War: Warhammer
   </em>
  </strong>
  's biggest strengths lies in the diversity of its factions. For instance, the Dwarf Realms field heavily armored infantry and siege engines, while the Vampire Counts rely on a mix of undead fodder units, monstrous creatures, and potent spellcasters. Because of this, every army poses unique tactical challenges; players have to consider their strengths and their enemy's advantages before engaging in battle.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Medieval 2: Total War
   </strong>
  </em>
  was the first full-bodied sequel in the franchise. On top of that,
  <em>
   Medieval 2
  </em>
  has also been a source of memes in the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series. Most notably, fans recall cheats that added Elephant Artillery and Elephant Rocketeers to the campaign — and they're about as fun as they sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Medieval 2
  </em>
  is also a favorite game for modders. In fact,
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  is rumored to have been inspired by the full conversion mod,
  <em>
   Call of Warhammer: Beginning of the End Times
  </em>
  , which proves just how malleable this title's game engine was. Players who loved the first
  <em>
   Medieval: Total War
  </em>
  game were more than happy to see the sequel improve upon this title's mechanics while adding new features for fans to mess around with.

  is more than just a sequel to
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer

  . Both games have similar strengths and weaknesses, but
  <em>
   Warhammer 2
  </em>
  is generally considered to be more fleshed out. The game also has a ton of downloadable content. It's easy to say that
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer 2

  is the most expansive
  <em>

  game ever released.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Warhammer 2
  </em>
  is single-handedly the largest and most diverse game in the series, benefitting from all of the content from
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  and seventeen unique content packs.
  <em>
   Warhammer 2
  </em>
  also does an excellent job of expanding on features and factions from the first game through new scenarios, new tech options, and new warlords.

  Even at its time of release in 2002,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Medieval: Total War
   </em>
  </strong>
  wasn't the prettiest game, but it expanded heavily on
  <em>
   Shogun
  </em>
  's foundation. It helped that the game was a blast to play through, and players had to be ready for any curveballs in the campaign that could derail their progress quite a bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally, critics and fans praised the game's AI, which put up a good challenge on any difficulty setting. The campaign world was also larger and included numerous factions and religions, giving the game excellent replay value and turning it into a classic that many fans still remember fondly to this day.

  While a lot of games in the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series focused on expanding the play space with new factions, larger landmasses, and a broad selection of tactical units and abilities,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Total War: Shogun 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  simplified things quite a bit. Fortunately, that led to an overall tighter and more polished experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Total War: Shogun 2
  </em>
  's flagship features was the Realm Divine—a crucial step towards a victory that would cause all AI factions to declare war with players in the campaign. Players either loved it or hated it, but it was structured in a way that it could always be planned for. Overall, it helped put the idea of "total war" to the test. Overall,
  <em>
   Shogun 2
  </em>
  is one of the franchise's most completed packages, offering a detailed, addictive, and challenging campaign that will (hopefully) never grow out of fashion.

  The
  <strong>
   In Search of Lost Dreams
  </strong>
  event functions similarly to certain other ones in previous
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  seasons, such as the Strings of Time event from the Fireworks season. This event features a series of objectives for players to complete during their daily adventures, and this time around, at least most of them are focused exclusively on activities related to the
  <strong>
   Eerie Season
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The objectives are subdivided into daily allowances, and
  <strong>
   each tier contains four different objectives per day
  </strong>
  . You have the liberty to complete some or all of the objectives in a tier, but you're not required to do the latter to unlock the next tier.

    <p>
     Each tier is actually time-locked, so you simply need to wait until it unlocks after a daily server reset.

  Across four different tiers (days), there are a total of
  <strong>
   16 possible objectives
  </strong>
  that you can complete for rewards in the In Search of Lost Dreams event. They each carry different requirements that must be fulfilled in order to receive credit in the form of
  <strong>
   Dream's Turn tokens
  </strong>
  . Each objective grants 100 Dream's Turn tokens, which you can then use in exchange for several rewards.

   <strong>
    Treat the Bullquet five times
   </strong>
   - Just as before, use the Soothing Aroma Vial at the Bullquet's Habitat to "treat" the Bullquet using the appropriate Aroma Formula ingredients. The animal's coat will change color each time you do it. Once you've completed the process at least five times in total, the objective will be fulfilled.

   - To achieve this, visit the Queen's Palace Ruins at night (22:00-4:00) and make your way to the vast courtyard area. There, you can see large Illusiblooms wrapped around the second statue in the center of the courtyard. Approach it and open Photo Mode to take a picture of the flowers.

     <li>
      Lying is common in Resident Evil to hide past exploits and personal motives.

     <li>
      Characters like Luis, Neil, and Simmons use deception for personal gain.

  Lying is often seen as a pretty bad character trait, but in the world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  where everyone is forced to fight for themselves amidst a zombie outbreak, being untruthful can actually turn out to be pretty helpful. While there have obviously been many villains who have used their clever way with words to deceive others, even a few of the good guys seen across this immensely popular series have hidden information every now and again for their own personal reasons too.
 </p>
 <p>
  To put it simply, it can be hard to know who to trust in
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  when almost every character has their own motives and ambitions, but there are definitely a few individuals who have been exposed to be much bigger liars than others. These are the members of the cast who are known for spinning the truth whenever they get the chance.

 <p>
  For much of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , the mysterious Spaniard known as Luis Serra seems like a happy-go-lucky resident of the village who claims to have once been a cop in Madrid, before he got caught up in the whole Los Illuminados fiasco. However, despite saying this to Leon with full confidence near the beginning of the original game, it turns out much later that this was untrue, and was simply a ploy to hide his previous role as one of Saddler's top researchers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luis is ashamed of what he contributed to Saddler's experiments, especially after seeing how much chaos it has caused, and as so, he attempts to bury his past by concealing it from others through lies and riddles. Still, this doesn't necessarily make Luis a bad guy, since he does ultimately help out Leon and Ashley when they become infected, but he does have a bad habit of being untruthful.

  At the beginning of
  <em>
   Resident Evil Revelations 2
  </em>
  , Neil seems like a pretty friendly member of TerraSave, the same group that Claire Redfield belongs to. However, he has some very sinister motives in mind. Neil claims at the beginning of the game that he is "looking out for TerraSave" and all of its loyal members, but this is actually a massive lie.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire reason Claire, Moira, and several other TerraSave employees were abducted and taken to a prison was due to Neil making a deal with none other than Alex Wesker. Neil led several of his own employees into a false sense of security so he could get his hands on Uroboros, though he does eventually get what's coming to him later in the game.

  Considering Simmons is so high up the governmental ladder, he seems like a fairly ordinary law-abiding citizen to begin with, but this is because he's hiding his true ambitions from those beneath him. The biggest victim of his lies is Sherry, who is strung along for much of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6's
  </em>
  story, believing that Simmons isn't the one behind the whole C-virus outbreak, which even puts her at odds with her old friend Leon.
 </p>
 <p>
  In another sense, Simmons is also prone to lying to himself. For example, when Ada rejects him, Simmons takes it upon himself to create a 'new' Ada by birthing a clone called Carla, simply because he can't accept the truth of Ada's true feelings and wants to continue living in ignorant bliss.

  Because Ada is a spy who always keeps her cards close to her chest, it's hard to deduce whether what she says is the truth, or a lie, since she's not shy about twisting the truth if it makes her mission easier. In fact, Ada lies during her very first scene in the series, where she tries to pose as an FBI agent to earn Leon's trust, which actually ends up working.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she does eventually become a bit more honest with Leon as the two warm up to one another, being a spy means that lying is an important tool within Ada's arsenal, and one which she has deployed numerous times throughout the games. Most recently, she lied to Wesker at the end of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 Remake
  </em>
  when she praised his Uroboros plan, only to immediately change course after she got off the headset, insinuating she was far from thrilled about destroying the entire planet.

  While the Baker Family in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  are presented as being a vicious, bloodthirsty group of humans who have clearly been infected, Lucas is a little different. While he does have the same Mold infection as his parents, he has secretly been taking medicine to free him of Eveline's control, giving him more agency than the rest of his family.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the catch is that Lucas had to continue lying to Eveline to try and make her believe that he was still loyal, which is an act he kept up for a very long time, until he was finally confronted by Ethan. Lucas may look down on himself, but one thing is for sure, he's a damn good liar for being able to survive while still being around the menacing B.O.W known as Eveline.

  <em>

  . O'Brian sends Jill and Parker to the Queen Zenobia with the task of 'rescuing' Chris Redfield, but it's not long before they realize this entire plan was actually made up.
 </p>
 <p>
  O'Brians intention was to send the pair into a dangerous situation, in order to then draw out Veltro to expose them for their role in the Terragrigia Incident. Needless to say, Jill wasn't all that happy about O'Brian's lies, and it has made him a pretty morally gray character within the wider series.

  If players return back to Mendez's house with Ashley in the

  </em>
  , they can find a document which exposes just how big of a liar Saddler truly is, which ultimately ends up making him the supreme leader of an entire army. When Saddlder first appeared in the village, he convinced the villagers that they needed to be cleansed of their 'sins', while also trying to claim that the Los Illuminados are a group with good intentions at heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this is far from the truth, as Saddler's real plan was to infect Ashley and then send her back to America to instigate a national outbreak. However, his lies succeeded in managing to grant him a massive force of loyal followers who Leon would be forced to take down in his mission to save Ashley.

  It's no secret that Albert Wesker, the flagship villain of the series, is a master manipulator, and as so, he's told more than a few lies during his many appearances. In the first game, for example, he is constantly lying about the entire situation to try and mask the fact he has been hired by Umbrella. He even goes as far as to try and push suspicion onto Barry, even though Wesker is the one who blackmailed Barry to work for him in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wesker also isn't above lying to those who serve him; so long as they dedicate everything to his mission, he will tell them as many sweet little lies as it takes to make them loyal. Despite promising Excella a life together in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , for example, he injects her with Uroboros and sends her to mutate and die after he found no more use for her, making him an extremely ruthless and sadistic individual.

  Upon using the Gold Lamp to seal the powers of the sandstorms, you can speak with Jasmine again to start the Carpet Diem quest in
  <em>
   DDV
  </em>
  . There are many quests you should complete to trigger the Carpet Diem quest:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Ancient Revealed Quest

  <li>
   Brave the Storm Quest
  </li>
  <li>
   Monkey Business Quest

  <li>
   Wish Magic Quest
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After that, interact with the Magic Carpet to fly high to the top of the wind swirl with Aladdin. There, you must use every piece of information you learned in Agrabah to destroy all four crystals.

  Destroying all four crystals will make the structure collapse, forcing you to jump on the Magic Carpet to head down safely. This will save Agrabah from any further destruction, leaving players the opportunity to invite the characters back to Dreamlight Valley.

  Complete the quest by speaking with Aladdin, who reveals he doesn't mind going to the valley as long as Jasmine wishes to go. Talk with the Princess and then head back to Dreamlight Valley to build Aladdin and Jasmine's Palace. It's small considering the size of other houses, but it will cost Dreamers 20,000 Star Coins to build it.

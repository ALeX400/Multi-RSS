	<em>
	 Shinobi Battlegrounds
	</em>
	is an exciting
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Roblox
	 </em>
	</strong>
	game in the Battleground genre in which everyone can experience themselves as part of the Naruto universe. In this game, you have to fight with other players to earn RYO and spend it on rerolls of the best clans and their abilities. However, if you want better bloodlines and epic skills as fast as possible,
	<em>
	 Shinobi Battlegrounds
	</em>
	codes will help you achieve this goal.

	Unlike the original Naruto story, you are not limited to one clan's abilities and basic ninjutsu skills. Instead, by leveling up and rerolling your skills, you can experience the skill set of every character from Konoha and other iconic heroes.

	While skill timing and practice are critical to winning, leveling up and having the best abilities can be the key to your victory or defeat. Of course, you can endlessly improve your skills, win, and farm RYO for rerolls of new skills, but the developers understand that players love freebies and sometimes share free codes as rewards. However, remember that the
	<em>
	 Shinobi Battlegrounds
	</em>
	codes have a limited expiration date, so hurry up and get all the rewards.

	Like most
	<em>
	 Roblox

	games, the
	<em>
	 Shinobi Battlegrounds
	</em>
	developers occasionally update the code list in the game's description on the
	<em>
	 Roblox
	</em>
	platform. However, they do this so rarely, so this method can't be called reliable. Instead, you can check our guide periodically to find more active codes. In addition, you can subscribe to the official pages of the developers to learn about all the news and exclusive rewards before everyone else:

 <p>
	In
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	, shiny Pokemon are rare variants of a specimen with an alternative color palette, making them a fun addition for Trainers to hunt down and add to their collections, or show off to friends.

 <p>
	Many shiny Pokemon are introduced or boosted in availability through the various events that come and pass with each season of the game. For this reason, knowing how to obtain specific shinies is important, as there may be windows of opportunity to give yourself an advantage or better success rates. If
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	players are seeking shiny Jangmo-o, shiny Hakamo-o, or shiny Kommo-o, then they'll find all of the information they'll need to assist them on this hunt in the guide below.

	, Jangmo-o, and its evolutions, Hakamo-o and Kommo-o are making their shiny debut through the
	<strong>
	 2024 Pokemon GO Fest Global event
	</strong>
	. GO Fest 2024 has been broken up into four different sections, with three in-person regional events taking place first, followed by a global event in which players from all around the world can participate. Go Fest Global will kick off in-game on
	<strong>
	 July 13, 2024, at 10 AM local time

 <p>
	In general, Jangmo-o can be found as a
	<strong>
	 wild encounter
	</strong>
	or
	<strong>
	 10 KM Eggs
	</strong>
	and has previously appeared as a
	<strong>
	 1-star Raid Boss

	and through

	</strong>
	. On the other hand, both Hakamo-o and Kommo-o are only available through evolution, with a cost of
	<strong>
	 25 Candy
	</strong>
	to evolve Jangmo-o into Hakamo-o, and
	<strong>
	 100 Candy

 <p>
	When it comes to obtaining shiny Jangmo-o through the Pokemon GO Fest Global 2024 event, there will be restricted times that you can obtain this Pokemon on Day 1, known as habitats. On Day 2, you will be able to encounter Jangmo-o at any time of the day, as all habitats are released as general encounters for the remainder of the event. During Day 1, Jangmo-o will be available within the Shining Day habitat, which takes place between
	<strong>
	 11 AM - 12 PM, and 3 PM - 4 PM, local time
	</strong>
	.

 <p>
	To further increase your chances of encountering shiny Jangmo-o, players may wish to take advantage of Lures and Incense, as both of these items will increase the number of wild Pokemon spawns within proximity.

	While many of the Status effects in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Elden Ring
	 </em>
	</strong>
	focus on dealing immediate damage, some will also leave a longer effect on the player. These lasting status effects can still be cured and will immediately get rid of the debuff, otherwise, they will always be a hindrance to the player.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":285} -->

 <p>
	One of these status effects is Frostbite, which will damage a player upon being affected but also leave their defense lowered. Players will take more damage during the duration of this status effect, which can quickly spell defeat if you're already in a tight spot. Luckily, Frostbite is one of the status effects that can be cured, if it even gets past a player's resistance in the first place.

 <p>
	Frostbite can be cured once the status effect is applied or when it is building up to protect the player from feeling the initial damage of the effect. This can be done by using a
	<strong>
	 Thawfrost Boluse which is crafted using 1 Herba, 1 Cave Moss, and 1 Crag Eggs
	</strong>
	. The crafting recipe for this item can be found in the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook [16] which can be purchased by the Nomadic Merchant found in Ainsel River in the underground region. This item both cures Frostbite if it is in effect or clears out the bar of any build-up currently applied.

 <p>
	Players can also use the Incantations Bestial Constitution or Law of Regression, but the longer cast times on these options make them risky. Players can also
	<strong>
	 cure Frostbite by receiving fire damage
	</strong>
	through any possible method. While this will also damage the player, it is a unique cure for the status ailment that may come in handy on rare occasions.

	A player's resistance to Frostbite is determined by their

	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	, with many greatly helping in Robustness. Players can also equip the Stalwart Horn Charm to get a further boost if they have the Talisman slot available.

			<title>Why The Elder Scrolls 6 Should be Above The 'Starfield Treatment' For Consoles</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	More discussion is being had around
	<em>
	 <strong>
		The Elder Scrolls 6
	 </strong>
	</em>
	as the hype for
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	lulls in the wait for its Shattered Space DLC. While it is undeniable that
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	was one of the most expansive and ambitious releases that has come from Bethesda in some time, it seems inevitable that the next entry to the studio's massively popular fantasy RPG franchise will eclipse the space-faring title.

 <p>
	Fans have been waiting for
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls 6
	</em>
	for well over a decade at this point, with the expectations surrounding the title growing with every passing year. Despite being officially announced in 2018, Bethesda has been eerily silent in relation to the project ever since, but the hype around
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls 6
	</em>
	is still as high as ever. The legacy of
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls
	</em>
	and the huge fan base it has amassed over the past three decades speaks for itself, and
	<em>
	 TES6
	</em>
	should be spared from the same restrictive console availability that
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	controversially employed.

	It was no wonder that
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	attracted so much industry-wide attention in the run-up to its release, with the game marking the launch of Bethesda's first brand-new IP in over 25 years. With
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	's early marketing stressing uninhibited exploration across over 100 solar systems and 1,000 planets, it's not surprising that so many people were keen to get their hands on such an ambitious title.

 <p>
	However, many fans were shocked as more details began to release regarding
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	, particularly in regard to the news that the game would only be available on Xbox consoles and PC. Of course, this was made possible due to Microsoft's ownership of Bethesda, having acquired the popular studio through the purchase of its parent company, ZeniMax Media, in 2021 for $7.5 billion.

 <p>
	With Bethesda now falling under the Xbox Games Studio name,
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	acted as the first glimpse into a new life for the studio's most high-profile titles, with Microsoft leveraging its ownership to muscle PlayStation out of the Bethesda market. As a brand-new IP, keeping
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	's console presence limited to Xbox hardware was not as controversial as it otherwise might have been, but this same strategy should not be used for
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls 6
	</em>
	.

	The Elder Scrolls' Reputation is Too Large For Console Exclusivity
 </h3>
 <p>
	Bethesda has built up the reputation and community of
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls
	</em>
	over the past 30 years across a wide range of platforms, with its more recent releases having strong communities across most console names. If
	<em>

	to finally release.

	While it is only logical that Microsoft would use console exclusivity tactics to get a return on its massive acquisition investments, using this strategy for a franchise as large as
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls
	</em>
	may be more harmful than lucrative. It is fair to say that
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	was not as successful as Bethesda may have hoped it would be, and this stigma may carry forward into the launch of
	<em>
	 TES6
	</em>
	, meaning non-Xbox console users may be more inclined to simply not play the game whatsoever.

 <p>
	Reducing the available platforms for
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls 6
	</em>
	may be a gamble that Bethesda and Microsoft cannot afford to make, but above all else it would be an insult to fans who have waited so long for the title. With Microsoft stressing its ethos of ensuring that gaming remains "for everyone" after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it only seems right that a title as anticipated as
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls 6
	</em>
	should involve completely different platform plans from the restricted console availability of
	<em>
	 Starfield
	</em>
	.

			<title>Pokemon: Every Generation's Worst Starter, Ranked</title>

	Starter
	<strong>
	 Pokemon
	</strong>
	are some of the most beloved Pokemon in the entire
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	franchise, and it's easy to see why since they have a whole lot of love and character infused into their designs. As the first partner Pokemon that Trainers get their hands on, they have a big role to fill as the stalwart companions over a long and arduous journey to become the very best.

	But not every starter Pokemon is as useful as the others. There's often one choice in every new
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	generation that's just not as good as its companions, whether that's in terms of its popularity or its utility in battle.

		Updated May 31, 2024, by Ewan Selmes:
	 </strong>
	 The Pokemon franchise continues to grow and innovate, updating older Pokemon with new moves, tweaks to learnsets, and even brand-new Abilities for fan-favorite Pokemon. Each new entry to the series, along with the franchise's new approach of releasing DLC and updates, gives players more opportunities to use their favorite Pokemon. Of course, these changes benefit some Pokemon more than others. Here's an updated list of the worst starter Pokemon in each generation.

	Many

	Cyndaquil has been a popular starter Pokemon since its introduction in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Gold and Silver
	</em>
	, having legions of dedicated fans. It's a great Pokemon. But in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Arceus
	</em>
	, it's just not as useful as its competitors, Rowlet and Oshawott.

 <p>
	Rowlet is great throughout the game, while Oshawott offers a strong starting position with super-effective moves against Noble Pokemon Kleavor. In contrast, Cyndaquil doesn't offer quite as many advantages, being a solid performer but without the early efficacy of Oshawott, and the later game flexibility of Hisuian Decidueye.

 <p>
	But its fantastic new design and the addition of the Ghost type has meant that Hisuian Typhlosion has many fans of its own. And thanks to the large roster of Pokemon available in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Arceus
	</em>
	, it's easy to build an effective team no matter the choice of starter Pokemon. What's more, H-Typhlosion's Signature Attack, Infernal Parade, is a real scorcher.

	A great Pokemon in its own right, Sobble is nevertheless the worst of the starter Pokemon in its trio. Introduced in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Sword and Shield
	</em>
	, Sobble has a cute design, and in its final evolution, Inteleon, is a powerful Special Attacker. Sobble is a bit of a glass cannon, and it's nowhere near as effective as Cinderace with the Libero Hidden Ability. Make no mistake, Sobble and its evolutions are fantastic Pokemon and do well in any playthrough. They just aren't quite as good as the competition.

 <p>
	When little Sobble evolves into Inteleon, it can use the powerful
	<strong>
	 Snipe Shot
	</strong>
	move. With the Gigantamax Factor, it can become Gigantamax Inteleon, which has an awesome and exclusive G-Max Move,
	<strong>
	 G-Max Hydrosnipe
	</strong>
	. This is a great move, but it's still not quite as good as what Cinderace or Rillaboom get, putting poor Sobble in last place for its generation.

	introduced players to the tropical island paradise of Alola, and with it came three new starter Pokemon. All three options were great, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, but the worst choice in this generation is Rowlet. Rowlet is a cute little bird, and its final evolution, Decidueye, is great in battle and has a fantastic design. While Rowlet is great to start with, its weaknesses become more apparent as the game goes on. On the other hand, its competitors become more useful.

	Although a fantastic Pokemon in its own right, neither it nor its evolutions can compete with the competitive efficacy or the in-game utility of Litten or Popplio. Incineroar, Litten's final evolution, is a real beast of the competitive scene, especially with its Intimidate Hidden Abilit. Meanwhile, Popplio and Primarina are beloved by fans and have nice utility in the game.

	The Grass-type starter Pokemon for
	<em>
	 Pokemon X
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Y
	</em>
	, Chespin has an adorable design. Evolving into the powerful and bulky Chesnaught, it gains the Fighting type too. But Chespin and Chesnaught don't really stand out at all in what was admittedly a tight competition. Super cute Fire-type starter Fennekin, and Water-type starter Froakie, are both much more popular and more useful options.

 <p>
	Froakie's final evolution, Greninja, was so popular it even got a special form in the game based on Ash Ketchum's Greninja from the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	anime. Such heavy competition puts Chespin squarely in last place for Kalos, despite its decent stats, nice movepool, and great theming.

 <p>
	The Grass-type starter Pokemon from
	<em>
	 Pokemon Black and White
	</em>
	, Snivy is a starter Pokemon with attitude. As a pure Grass-type Pokemon, Snivy is at a major disadvantage throughout the game. Its companions, Tepig and Oshawott, are just a bit more useful. Snivy's Hidden Ability, Contrary, can make it somewhat useful competitively. But its lack of utility in its debut generation makes it the worst choice of starter Pokemon.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":980} -->

 <p>
	Its final evolution, Serperior, has a great design theme. However, its Grass type leaves it with a weakness to many Gym Leaders, including late-game Gym Leader Brycen, an Ice-type master. Unfortunately for Snivy, Oshawott and Tepig fare better during normal gameplay.

	Grass-type starter Pokemon Turtwig has a great design that's full of character. It evolves into the brilliant Grass/Ground dual-type,Torterra. Unfortunately, Turtwig has stiff competition. The Fire-type starter of its generation, Chimchar, is one of the only viable Fire types in the Sinnoh region, making it an easy choice for many players.

 <p>
	Even worse for Turtwig, Piplup's final evolution, Empoleon, has a great dual type with the defensive Steel type, whereas Torterra has a lot of weaknesses. Turtwig slides further back thanks to Empoleon's fantastic Hidden Ability
	<strong>
	 Competitive,
	</strong>
	which boosts Sp. Atk. whenever its stats are lowered. Despite its stellar design theme, Torterra languishes in last place.

	Generation 3's
	<em>
	 Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
	</em>
	featured a host of strong and powerful Pokemon for players to catch and use in battle, and the starter trio was no exception. Fire-type starter Pokemon Torchic evolves into the powerful and super cool Blaziken, the first Fire/Fighting type starter Pokemon featured in the franchise.

 <p>
	Unfortunately, Torchic simply isn't as useful as its two companions. Grass-type Treecko has great utility against the region's many Water-type Pokemon as well as against Gym Leaders, and Swampert is a great choice all around. Blaziken fared better on the competitive scene, especially in more recent generations with its Hidden Ability
	<strong>
	 Speed Boost.
	</strong>
	But during its debut generation, Torchic made for a difficult adventure through Hoenn.

 <p>
	Although Chikorita's final evolution, Meganium, is one of the strongest Pokemon in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Gold and Silver,
	</em>
	it also takes the position as the worst starter in its generation. Chikorita, Bayleef, and Meganium all suffer from the Grass-type's relative weakness in Johto.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":990} -->

 <p>
	Chikorita and its evolutions have less-than-favorable matchups for most of Johto's Gyms, being most useful in the post-game Kanto portion of
	<em>
	 Gold and Silver
	</em>
	. Chikorita and its evolutions have shallow movepools without many options for coverage, and in Generation 2's Johto and Kanto, that's a big problem. Totodile and Cyndaquil simply offer more utility and are stronger during the usual course of gameplay.

	Cute, charming, and beloved by legions of adoring fans, Charmander is also the worst starter of its Generation. Grass-type Bulbasaur and Water-type Squirtle were both much more useful choices in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Red and Blue.
	</em>
	Bulbasaur in particular is a great choice for many of the region's Gyms, including the first two. Charmander, by contrast, is a poor choice until mid-game, being useful only for the Grass-type Pokemon Gym.

 <p>
	Charizard has great stats and a nice movepool, and is one of the best Fire type Pokemon available in Pokemon Red and Blue. It's just not as useful over the course of the game as Bulbasaur or Squirtle. Still, Charizard is one of the most popular Pokemon of all time and has had many, many appearances in the anime, spin-off games, and main series. it's even gotten two exclusive Mega Evolutions.

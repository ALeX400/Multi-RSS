  Combat is a core aspect of any RPG, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes it to the next level with its realistic, skill-based melee system. Every clash, block, and strike feels authentic, making it crucial for players to have the best gear at all times. However, weapons and armor degrade over time, losing durability and effectiveness, especially for those frequently engaging in battle. When this happens,
  <strong>
   repairing them becomes essential to maintain peak performance
  </strong>
  .

  As the quality of your armor or clothing depletes, you’ll need to repair them immediately. Thankfully, this can be done fairly early in the game. After the tutorial ends and you’re free to explore
  <strong>
   Troskovitz
  </strong>
  , head east to find
  <strong>
   Tailor Bartoshek
  </strong>
  during working hours. He’ll gladly sell you new clothes or repair your current ones if needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost of repairs depends on the clothing’s quality, but
  <strong>
   even the most expensive fixes only cost a few Groschen
  </strong>
  . This shouldn’t be an issue, especially if you’re completing early-game side quests.

  If you’ve acquired some armor and want to restore it to peak condition for combat, you’ll
  <strong>
   need to visit Blacksmith Radovan in Tachov
  </strong>
  . There’s a Fast Travel point there as well, so you can visit as much as you want in little to no time. Along with offering multiple side quests, he can repair your metal armor, ensuring it’s as good as new.

  When it comes to repairing your weapons, if you're not keen on spending your hard-earned money,
  <strong>
   you can look for a Sharpening Wheel
  </strong>
  , which is easy to find in most towns. This grindstone allows you to select a weapon and sharpen it to increase its quality. To use the Sharpening Wheel, press the
  <strong>
   Pedal key
  </strong>
  (L2/LT on your controller) repeatedly. Then, move the blade around until you see sparks fly from your sword, indicating it's sharpening.

     Be careful, though, as the process can damage your weapon and eventually destroy it. The Sharpening Wheel
     <strong>
      will start to emit smoke
     </strong>
     , serving as a warning to stop.

  If you’d rather not waste your valuable time sharpening a weapon for an extended period, you can head to Blacksmith Radovan,
  <strong>
   who can repair both your metal armor and weapons
  </strong>
  . Alternatively,
  <strong>
   you can use Repair Kits to fix your weapons
  </strong>
  , armor, and clothes. These kits can be
  <strong>
   purchased from traders and merchants
  </strong>
  , but repairing high-grade weapons will require a higher Craftsmanship skill level. There are multiple types of kits present in the game:

   : Monopoly GO’s Partner Events are collaborative challenges where you can team up with your friends and work your way to amazing prizes. A new Partner Event typically rolls out monthly, bringing fresh themes and new objectives. As you work together with your partners and build the necessary attractions on the board, you’ll win exciting prizes along the way. Think rare sticker packs, Wild Stickers, new board tokens, and a generous amount of dice — all of these can be yours if you actively play the Partner Event. Although the next Monopoly GO Partner Event hasn't been officially announced, we've updated this guide with a tentative start date.

  EA seems to be one of many companies that are currently excited for the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  , with the company's CEO recently speaking about the upcoming console. While players all over the world have been anticipating the Nintendo Switch 2's release, it seems that many developers and industry leaders have been, as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it may still seem like too long for big Nintendo fans, there isn't too much longer to wait before a major showcase for the Nintendo Switch 2. After a brief teaser revealed some basics about its appearance, Nintendo announced a Nintendo Switch 2 Direct for April, and fans have been counting the days since.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the CEO of EA, Andrew Wilson, has spoken on the Nintendo Switch 2 and what it means for his own company. During a earnings call (via NintendoLife), Wilson noted that any new console is a potential benefit for EA, giving it the ability to reach new audiences. He acknowledged that EA games tend to do well on Nintendo consoles, and EA seems to be expecting that
  <em>
   Madden
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   FC
  </em>
  games will do well on the Switch 2. Further, the EA CEO indicated that
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  series did well on the current Nintendo Switch, and that half of the players had never played an EA game before, further cementing his prior words.

  The Industry Seems Ready for the Nintendo Switch 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  EA isn't the only video game company or developer that's expressed interest and excitement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2. Former PlayStation Head Shuhei Yoshida has talked about the Switch 2's reveal. However, there's also something to be said for waiting until a company is ready to show off its new developments. Yoshida and Hideki Kamiya, the game designer behind
  <em>
   Bayonetta
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Okami
  </em>
  , have shared their displeasure regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks. Yoshida hoped that Nintendo still had some secrets to reveal for the Switch 2, while Kamiya referred to leakers as "shameful people" for taking the experience of making a surprise reveal away from the company.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things look quite bright for the follow-up to the Nintendo Switch. Notably, EA's thoughts regarding the Nintendo Switch are a far cry from the WIi U, which saw a notable lack of support from many third-party developers, including EA. The developer stopped making titles for the Wii U due to a combination of poor console sales and performance issues. However, the portability, capability, and volume of sales of the Nintendo Switch seems to have made it more than viable for EA, and with any luck, the Switch 2 will deliver.

   <em>
    Path of Exile 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's classes are all designed to function well enough solo that a good build can clear even the highest difficulty of end-game content. With that said, due to the synergies between player abilities, playing in co-op can certainly be easier even with scaled-up enemy health. There are a lot of different classes and builds that combine well for co-op play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether a team is 2 players, 3 players, or 4 players, different combinations of classes and builds can provide unique results thanks to the way player abilities, buffs, and ailments interact. Co-op play goes up to 6 players in a party, but by that point, a party can have every class covered, so this topic will focus on the best compositions for 2-player, 3-player, and 4-player parties.

  The Witch and the Warrior make a good team. While the Warrior can stand toe-to-toe with enemies, the Witch can provide support with minions, enemy debuffs, and ally buffs. A lot of the Witch support skills that affect minions are designated as "Ally" buffs, which means they also affect other players who are in a party with a Witch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other temporary and persistent buffs function like this in the game. Players who want to play with a co-op focus should look out for the term ally in skill descriptions.

  A Warrior and a Sorceress can be highly complementary, depending on their builds. Sorceress players who are focused on lightning damage can inflict shock and increase the damage enemies take, leaving them open to big melee hits. Builds focused on cold damage can freeze enemies, which helps with crowd control and damage mitigation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Warrior can pull aggro from bosses and enemies to help the Sorceress stay at range, as well as dealing high stun damage to open up bosses to big bursts of elemental damage.

  The Monk and Ranger classes have a surprising amount of synergy, given that popular options for both classes involve speccing into lightning damage, cold damage, or both. That means that with both players throwing out the same elemental effects, elemental ailments will proc much faster, giving these two classes some devastating crowd control and damage potential when combined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rangers who specialize in skill shots like Snipe can also work with the Monk class, as the Tempest Bell skill can be aimed at by other players to trigger its effect and amplify their damage.

  A Monk and a Witch working together have formidable damage output. There are two main ways to make these classes work together. Both the Monk and the Witch have the option to spec heavily into chaos damage, which can burn through enemy health bars fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the better option, though, is to focus on up-front damage with the Monk, while the Witch provides curse support, weakening enemies. The Witch can also use minions to support the Monk in melee while spreading debilitating effects from afar.

  As both these classes need to stay at range, this might seem like a counter-intuitive pairing, but the Mercenary and Sorceress can work quite well together. With a Sorceress focused on cold damage, a Mercenary using Fragmentation Rounds can do devastating damage by consuming freeze on enemies and detonating ice crystals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mercenary's Oil Grenade can give a big damage boost to a Sorceress using Flame Wall-boosted projectiles to spread ignite damage around, as it inflicts enemies with fire exposure. The crowd control effects that a Sorceress can output can also be used for easy hits with grenades and other Mercenary abilities that need enemies to stay in one place.

  The cumbersome part of playing a Mercenary, at least in the early game, comes down to reloading and switching ammo types while under pressure from enemies. Working with a Witch that uses a minion frontline can help alleviate these frustrations, as the minions will keep a lot of enemies occupied, allowing Mercenaries to do their thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players focusing on cold damage, the Witch's Skeletal Frost mages can help a lot with proccing freeze effects quickly, letting the Mercenary focus on damage output.

  Once a party gets to three players, it's fairly easy to overwhelm enemies if all players are working together. With a Witch, Sorceress, and Warrior on the team, players can cover the frontline with the Warrior supported by minions like the Skeletal Reavers, and output devastating damage from behind with the Sorceress.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, the Sorceress can focus on zoning and crowd control with ice walls and cold damage, while the Warrior finishes off CC'd enemies, and the Witch supports with more ranged elemental damage from her casting minions.

  This three-person team has incredible DPS potential. A Monk, Mercenary, and Sorceress can offer a kind of aggressive crowd control, where each player is throwing out elemental ailments, and using the ailments to trigger bigger bursts of damage. The Monk can give out both cold and lightning damage from the frontline, as well as deploy the Tempest Bell to amplify other effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mercenary and Sorceress can both output lightning, cold damage, and freeze buildup themselves and use other skills to detonate the freeze effect for even more damage. The Sorceress's Flame Wall can also boost all projectiles going through it, which the Mercenary can benefit greatly from.

  This party combo is great at making enemies weak and ineffective, keeping the threats away from the Ranger and Witch, and reducing the damage the Warrior takes at the same time. The Warrior's ability to break armor can help the Ranger deal physical damage from range, and increase the effectiveness of the Witch's melee minions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ranger can spec into effects like maim and slow on their skills, which can help keep enemies manageable, while the Witch can spread around curses to make the enemy deal less damage or take more. This can also be an effective damage over time team, as all three can make good use of poison and bleed, and the Witch can add chaos damage.

  A four-player party can cover any situation, but at this size, players do need to use some skill synergies and work together to deal damage, as enemy health pools start getting quite large. With a Warrior, Witch, Sorceress, and Ranger, players have melee damage and ranged damage, as well as the option to use crowd control abilities from the Sorceress and Ranger to keep enemies locked down.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Witch can boost everyone's effectiveness by spreading curses around the enemy, and this team has the option to cover every type of elemental damage if they want.

  During gameplay, there are exciting opportunities to amass an impressive inventory of weapons, varying between two-handed and one-handed offerings. Different classes have their own options. Make sure to choose a weapon combination that includes
  <strong>
   either the shortbow and/or the staff as a base
  </strong>
  , and that corresponding weapons are used together. For instance, the lightning tome and lightning wand will ensure a high level of resistance to lightning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, make the most of the magic weapons provided when the game begins. The complete list of two-handed magic weapons includes Fire for significant damage, Frost for strong damage in multi-attack, and Lightning, which emits a beam of light that pierces every enemy in the way.

  Players who are new to
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  will be clueless as to which class to focus upon in the beginning. There are seven separate classes once gameplay advances, but at the start there are four: Paladin, Wizard, Warrior, and Ranger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike similar games in the genre, one of the best possible tips for newcomers is to
  <strong>
   play multiple characters at the same time
  </strong>
  . This way, players will gain an instant Level 1 bonus from each of the four classes straight away. For single players, it is highly recommended to either choose Paladin or Ranger, with the former possessing additional fast recovery benefits.

  Players' main focus in
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  should be the upgrading of their buildings, in order to be a stronger force with a greater impact in the game. Different buildings afford different benefits, but by far the most useful buildings to upgrade as soon as possible are the
  <strong>
   Chapel and the Hunter's Cabin.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason for this is simple: gold. When upgrading the Hunter's Cabin, which is available on every Tier, enemies will leave behind more and more materials which the player can turn into gold when each run ends. Meanwhile, the higher the Chapel is upgraded, the greater the volume of materials players will retain if they die in the middle of a run. The more core buildings that the player unlocks, the higher the upgrade benefits from each.

  Naturally, new players will want to learn as much as humanly (or wizardly) possible from each and every stage. The best way to do this to switch on the Mini Map feature. When a game first launches, this feature is switched off. Head to the settings tab, open the 'Game' section, and turn the toggle from off to on.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Mini Map active, players will be able to navigate from one place to the other much more effectively. It is also possible to adjust the size, opacity and the set-scale of the map too, leaving the less-detailed bigger map largely redundant.

  Not only are potions essential to getting involved in the game, but they are a lifeline in the latter stages. To unlock the ability to use potions,
  <strong>
   visit the Apothecary on the second floor of the mines
  </strong>
  . Once potions are unlocked, there will be a separate indicator alongside the mana and health bars.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three different potions: The Rejuvenation Potion, the Damage Potion, and the Invincibility Potion. Invincibility cannot spawn randomly, although the other two can. The more potions collected, the better. As
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  is a particularly tricky game with the complex Shadow Curse, players should always be on the lookout for health and damage boosts.

  As in real life situations, it always pays to know everything possible about the enemy.
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  is no exception. There are five main bosses to battle in the game, and each boss battle has its own unique challenges.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Totem Pole is the first boss. It can be found after the second Dark Caves, and requires players to stay out of the waves of fire. Next is Shadow Face Boss, who appears after the second Crypt. This boss can be defeated using the Explosion Combo. Even though beginner players will not have to worry about the other three just yet, it pays to be aware of them: The Plant Boss (after Dungeon 2), The Harbringers Dread Boss (after Barracks 2) and the Serpents of Demise Boss in the last act.

 <p>
  Even within the most complex and vast maps, some games tend to get tiresome when having to trek a certain distance with no fast travel mechanisms to speak of in the vicinity. This is where shortcuts come in.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a beginner, the most important shortcut to know about is the one that automatically releases after the first boss battle, Totem Pole, is completed. Using specific elemental weapons, players defeat the boss and the pathway directly through the main goblin camp in Forest 2 appears. From then on in the game, when players need to reach Forest 3, this pathway bypasses both the Totem Pole and the Dark Caves.

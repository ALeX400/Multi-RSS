  Sony's
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus Extra
  </strong>
  subscription gives players access to games that cover most needs. The service has lengthy RPGs like
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , shorter action games like
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  , and competitive multiplayer titles like
  <em>
   Soulcalibur 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  . There should be something for just about anyone, and that includes co-op.

  Local co-op and split-screen games encourage friends to come together for a night in front of the TV, and the best examples of these releases on PS Plus are mentioned in this article. However, online co-op is also popular, and Sony's subscription service does not neglect this feature. What are the
  <strong>
   best online co-op games on PS Plus

     Games that only support online co-op will be prioritized since local co-op titles are highlighted in a separate article , but a few exceptions will be included. Also, if a game's "PS Plus Availability" is set to "N/A," that means the title was removed from the service since this article's most recent update.

  PS Plus Extra's June 2024 lineup contained a range of online co-op options (two
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Far Cry 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Anno 1800
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Police Simulator: Patrol Officers
  </em>
  ), including a headline act that is synonymous with teamwork. Sure,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  can be played and enjoyed solo for 100+ hours without much issue; however, the game pushes its co-op element, something that can be said for most entries in Capcom's franchise.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has two types of quests: Village and Hub. The former are single-player only and, in total, last about 10 hours. While a bit too easy for veterans, these quests serve as an introduction for newcomers, teaching them the basic skills they will need to stand a chance in the harder missions. Once someone gets through the Village quests or feels confident in their abilities, they should head to the Hub to try out its many hunts, which are far harder and can be played in co-op.

  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  handles its co-op brilliantly, making it as easy as possible for friends to team up while removing some of the more frustrating elements in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  . Parties can try to synergize their builds to create a well-rounded team; alternatively, they can simply go with their preferred loadout and ignore everything else. As the Hub quests can take quite a long time to complete, co-op makes them easier to digest and arguably more enjoyable.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is a fantastic action-adventure game with a robust single-player campaign. A few months following the base title's debut, Sucker Punch dropped
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  , a co-op side experience deep enough to justify a standalone release. Along with common modes like Survival,
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  also comes with a Story that guides two players through roughly 6 hours of content.

  <em>
   Legends

  has four classes: Samurai, Ronin, Assasin, and Hunter. Each one fits an archetype and has a specific role they should be fulfilling in combat scenarios. While some options like the Samurai are viable for solo or two-player runs, classes like the Ronin are designed with support in mind.
  <em>
   Legends

  might just be the

  A popular first-person action game,
  <em>
   Warhammer: Vermintide 2
  </em>
  is celebrating its five-year anniversary in 2023. Despite its growing age, Fatshark's release is still reasonably active, and it is arguably the best action-oriented
  <em>

  </em>
  game of the last decade.
  <em>
   Vermintide 2
  </em>
  pits the Heroes of Ubersreik against wave after wave of rat-themed enemies, showering them with loot if they manage to survive.

  Supermassive's
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  is an anthology series that will eventually include 8 games; at the moment, four main entries have been released along with a VR spin-off. While not quite as robust as Supermassive's other horror projects like
  <em>

  and

  Although overshadowed by the couch iteration,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  ' online co-op is a valid option in its own right. Limited to two participants, the game automatically picks who will be actively playing the campaign and decides when to switch control. This system might not be to everyone's fancy, but it does provide a unique co-op experience since one player's actions directly impact the full group.

  Housemarque knows a thing or two about co-op.
  <em>
   Dead Nation
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  all make good use of the feature, and they support both local and online connections. The developer's most recent project,
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  , did not launch with multiplayer, but an online two-player co-op option was added as part of the
  <em>
   Ascension
  </em>
  update. Thanks to this addition, players can now join forces to take on the game's roguelike challenges, and there is the option to use a public or private server.

  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is challenging, and co-op does not necessarily make the experience easier. However, it does introduce a revive option into the gameplay loop, granting players a second chance. Otherwise, co-op provides essentially the same core experience as solo runs, albeit with two Selenes rather than just one. As the base package is fantastic, the same can be said about
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  's co-op.

  They might not come around as often as they once did, but it is always an exciting day when a
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  </em>
  game launches. And, in a nice change of pace from most of the franchise's post-2000s efforts,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is also great. Looking to recapture the Turtles' beat 'em up glory days, Tribute Games basically created a game ripped right out of the '90s, albeit with enough modern touches for it to come across as a loving homage rather than just an antiquated throwback. Up to six players can join forces to take on the Foot Clan, and they are free to pick from the Turtles, Master Splinter, April, and Casey Jones. Even at face value, that is a more than solid selection for this type of game, and that is before taking into account each character's unique traits. All the playable figures bring something fresh to the table, so even solo players can enjoy replaying the campaign by switching between the characters.

  Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  sticks fairly close to the standard beat 'em up formula. The characters have a limited but satisfying moveset, and the levels pack a considerable punch. The boss fights are quite difficult and require mastery of the combat system's mechanics to overcome. The stages are overflowing with references to
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  's past, and the nods cover many of the franchise's sides rather than just its gaming history.

  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is the most famous asymmetrical multiplayer game on the market, and that seems unlikely to change anytime soon. The game pits four survivors against one killer, with many of the available characters being based on popular IPs (although there are several original creations too). While one side of the equation will not be cooperating with anyone, the survivors should try to work together since they are considerably weaker than any of the killers. That said, players are largely left to their own devices, so they can decide themselves whether they wish to prioritize communication or not.

  <em>
   Dead by Daylight

  is kind of a weird inclusion as it is primarily advertised as an online multiplayer rather than co-op experience, which makes sense since matches are PvP rather than a group of players against AI. Nevertheless, it still works well as a co-op game, and it is among the best and most popular titles on PS Plus.

  Supporting both local and online co-op,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is the latest FPS release in the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  franchise, and the spin-off should be able to scratch the same itch as the mainline entries. The game caters to solo players quite well, offering them an enjoyable campaign set in a world inspired by
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  , all the while Tiny Tina acts as Dungeon Master. While the fantasy aesthetic provides a different feel than the post-apocalyptic sci-fi tone of the numbered games,
  <em>
   Wonderlands
  </em>
  is still ultimately a
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  project at heart, which means endless loot, an aggressive sense of humor, and a decent range of classes with a few build options. The gameplay feels similar to
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , albeit with a few tweaks and novelties thrown in for good measure.

  While a single-player run is fun,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  truly comes alive when partaken in co-op, a statement that is true for nearly every game in the franchise. Considering its
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  inspiration, playing with friends is an even better fit for the spin-off than the main entries, even if the game's handling of the feature is not all that different from
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Wonderlands
  </em>
  provides a few options so that parties can craft a co-op experience that suits them, including a choice between shared or exclusive loot.

  2018's
  <em>
   Tetris Effect
  </em>
  gave the ultimate classic video game a contemporary makeover, creating a modern reimagining that stuck true to the original's blueprint while carving out a unique identity all of its own. That version was and still is fantastic, an easy recommendation for players craving a robust puzzle game designed around solo content. In 2020,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  hit the market, an upgrade that – as suggested by its subtitle – focused on multiplayer. Providing a fairly addictive PvP experience, this iteration incorporated a range of modes that complement the gameplay loop. While
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is largely associated with single-player content, the franchise is obviously a good match for competitive play, and
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  showcases as much.

  As fun as PvP is,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  is specifically named after its online co-op mode. This option allows a few players to share the screen as they work towards completing separate puzzles while taking on an AI opponent. On the surface, this might sound like a basic implementation of co-op that does not add all that much to the core experience; however,
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  has one great twist: the players' puzzles combine to create a single canvas. This development is a treat whenever it triggers during matches, and it creates a cooperative exchange that works wonders.

  <em>

  The differences between
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  's playable survivors are not skin-deep either. Each character has unique traits and default weapons, which encourages teams to craft parties consisting of survivors that bring the best out of each other. Even though it is not a masterpiece and has had a fairly short lifespan for this type of project,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  is more than good enough to keep a group of friends engaged for a few hours.

 <p>
  An April 2024 PlayStation Plus addition,
  <em>
   The Crew 2
  </em>
  might not seem like an obvious recommendation at first. For one, Ubisoft's game was not particularly well received at launch, even if it was largely considered to be an improvement over its predecessor. As a sequel,
  <em>
   The Crew Motorfest
  </em>
  , launched in 2023, the 2018 release is now old news and unlikely to attract all that many new players, especially since it has been steeply discounted over the years. Taking all these things into account,
  <em>
   The Crew 2
  </em>
  seems destined to be forgotten, just a name on an expansive list of
  <strong>
   PS Plus online co-op games
  </strong>
  ; however, as far as open-world racers are concerned, this title is far from bad, especially when played with a few other people.

 <p>
  After all these years,
  <em>
   The Crew 2
  </em>
  's community has dwindled significantly, which can be a death sentence for an online-driven project like this. Fortunately, the game is at its best when a group of friends make plans to join the same world, an option that is still available today. Along with competing in races,
  <em>
   The Crew 2
  </em>
  has quite a few team-based events that emphasize multiplayer. Consequently, co-op is required to experience everything this title has to offer.

  Team Ninja's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  prequel got a mixed reception at reveal and launch, dooming it to become something of a footnote in the franchise's long legacy. Despite only coming out in 2022, the game has been forgotten already, and it is hardly an easy project to recommend since it does not try to scratch the same itch as most
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  releases. However, if a player is specifically searching for a hack and slash title with a linear campaign and a fairly robust job system, they should find what they are looking for with
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin
  </em>
  . Unsurprisingly, the combat is fast-paced, deep, and satisfying; while not quite reaching
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden Black
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  levels, it is still high quality. The story is generally entertaining nonsense that the characters take very seriously, which just adds to the amusement.

  A less-advertised feature of
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise
  </em>
  is its co-op support, which allows three players to join forces. Outside the tutorial and a couple of missions, most of the campaign can be played in online co-op, with the guest players taking charge of Jack's comrades. Players will need to have reached an appropriate level in their playthroughs (or by playing co-op) to join in, so a beginner cannot jump into a late-game co-op session. Although prioritizing solo runs,
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise
  </em>
  implements co-op fairly well, and the feature brings a new dimension to the gameplay. It also makes replaying missions way more fun.

  Another zombie shooter akin to something like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4: Dead War
  </em>
  is for those people who prefer a third-person perspective. Even though the game does not quite have the same name recognition as either of those projects, it is a respectable entry in the subgenre. As is always the case, four players can join forces to blast their way through fairly self-contained levels filled with a colorful and grotesque assortment of flesh-eaters.

  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  shakes things up by being set after World War 2 and granting a Nazi coat of paint to its armies of the walking dead. This setting is the element that distinguishes the game the most from its peers, and the campaign makes good use of the premise.
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  guides players through an over-the-top and entertaining story that is long enough to feel substantial without overstaying its welcome. Along with a decent selection of weapons,
  <em>
   Dead War

  uses a rewarding perk system that adds some flavor to combat.

  Even though PS Plus Extra's

  loses points for being just the base game rather than the superior

  <em>
   World War Z
  </em>
  is one of those releases that is difficult to passionately recommend to solo players, even though it supports the feature. The game is intended to be experienced as part of a team, and a single-player run can become dull quickly. However, multiplayer enhances the gameplay's value, justifying a playthrough. Fans of the
  <em>

  book or movie might also enjoy jumping into the universe, although the game does not have much to do with either property.

  <em>

  has led such a strange existence. Each entry tackles a different subgenre of action-adventure games, with some even venturing into RPG territory.
  <em>
   Darksiders Genesis
  </em>
  marks the franchise's biggest departure to date, as the spin-off is a top-down hack and slash akin to something like
  <em>
   Victor Vran
  </em>
  . The game is also clearly meant to be experienced in co-op since it features two playable Horsemen: Strife and War. Solo players can swap between the two at will, which generally means they pick War when melee combat is the focus and then switch to Strife for ranged damage.

 <p>
  In local or online co-op, two players take charge of either Strife or War, allowing the powerful Horsemen to rain havoc simultaneously. Although they do not sync up all that much,
  <em>

  ' characters are both fairly deep and offer a good range of loadout options to keep things interesting throughout the campaign. Since couch co-op utilizes a restrictive split-screen, online multiplayer is the better option in this case.

  One of 2023's best co-op games,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is an addictive co-op party game that takes an annoying real-life venture and makes it aggressively entertaining. On paper, a title that revolves around moving furniture sounds tedious, and
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  wisely does not eliminate the act's inherent frustration but instead uses it as fuel for its physics-based shenanigans. Players will need to work together to carefully and safely guide each item from one home to the next, and the routes can get pretty crazy as the campaign progresses.

 <p>
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is divided into levels that are extended puzzles, and there is no attempt to adhere to reality. Compared to the original game, which is also on PS Plus Extra, the sequel goes for broke in its settings, opting to throw multidimensional travel into the mix. This decision pays off beautifully and creatively. While solo play is possible,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is 100% designed for co-op.

  Frozenbyte's
  <em>
   Trine
  </em>
  is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for co-op-driven action-platformer games. All the franchise's titles are worth seeking out, however, PS Plus subscribers will need to settle for
  <em>
   Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince
  </em>
  . Despite the number in its title, this entry can be enjoyed without prior knowledge of its predecessors, so newcomers can start here.

  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  follows three heroes (a mage, thief, and knight) as they go on an epic fantasy-laden adventure that tests their might and teamwork. While not devoid of combat, the campaign focuses on puzzles and platforming, with the former requiring creative use of the characters' abilities. In solo runs, players can switch between the characters with the click of a button; in co-op, each user takes charge of one hero.
  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  features two modes: Classic and Unlimited. The former ties three players to specific heroes, while the latter allows four users to swap to any character whenever they want.

  Ah,
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  – a game that attracted plenty of hype before its debut but faded into the shadows fairly quickly after launch. Reminiscent of AA projects of old (which can be said for most People Can Fly games), this sci-fi looter shooter is the definition of a mixed bag. The third-person gunplay is explosive, aggressive, and reasonably customizable thanks to solid weapon selection. When focusing solely on combat,
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  is generally a fun but derivative time; unfortunately, the rest of the game can be a drag. The story has some interesting ideas but does not bring them together in a way that takes full advantage of their potential, resulting in a simultaneously confusing and forgettable plot. Although improving after launch, the endgame is not particularly rewarding and falls into repetition way too quickly.
 </p>

 <p>
  While still present, those negatives become mostly minor inconveniences when
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  is played in co-op. Allowing three players to experience the campaign together, the game's class system really shines when teams create builds that complement each other, which is not that difficult to do. The visceral action benefits from the added mayhem afforded by larger firefights, alleviating an entertaining system to even higher heights. Honestly,
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  is worth a playthrough for solo players craving a decent third-person shooter; however, it is almost a must-play as a
  <strong>
   PS Plus co-op game
  </strong>
  .

  Up to four players can convene to take on the game's plethora of challenging fights, with the helpers being sent back to their universes if they die or take down a boss. It should be noted that while co-op is ongoing, two invaders can also show up to add a PvP twist to the tale, so players should always be on their toes.

  The main story will keep players engaged for a good 30 hours, and this section can be largely enjoyed solo. Alternatively, most of the campaign can be experienced in co-op, which unlocks after the story's intro is completed. In comparison, the endgame content revolves heavily around PvP and online co-op. Four players can combine to create squads and take on missions, while that number is doubled for raids.

  If there's one skin that longtime
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have been desperately hoping to make a potential comeback in the undisclosed future, this is without a doubt the iconic Pink Mercy skin. Pink Mercy was originally released in May 2018, with the profits from purchases of the cosmetic being donated to Breast Cancer Research.

 <p>
  Finally, players who missed out on the one-time chance to obtain this skin for the beloved Swiss Support Hero will have a second chance, as Pink Mercy, plus a brand new variant of the skin, Rose Gold Mercy, is being released in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2's
  </em>
  Season 11. For this reason, players will need to know exactly how they can get their hands on either one or both of these skins as they desire, which has been detailed in the guide below.

  Both the Pink Mercy and Rose Gold Mercy skins will be available to purchase during
  <em>
   Overwatch 2's
  </em>
  Season 11, with funds being donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, just as the profits from the original Pink Mercy release in 208 were. According to a news post on Overwatch's official forums, the return of this skin and new variant recolor are not only to raise money for a brilliant cause but to celebrate Overwatch 2 achieving over 100 million players.

 <p>
  The original Pink Mercy skin was priced at $14.99 USD and managed to raise a huge $12.7 million USD. With Pink Mercy making a return, players will be able to pick up this skin for the same price. Players eager to secure this skin for their collection will be able to pick up Pink Mercy from
  <strong>
   June 25, 2024
  </strong>
  , and 100% of the profits raised will be donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

 <p>
  In addition to the Pink Mercy skin, a new variant with a slightly altered color palette, Rose Gold Mercy, will also be available at the slightly increased price of $19.99 USD, as this cosmetic comes with a couple of additional items in a bundle. Much like the Pink Mercy skin, players can rest assured that 100% of their payment will be forwarded to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

 <p>
  DLC has become a staple of video games, including single-player games. While microtransactions are still very unpopular, substantial DLCs that include value have a better reputation and have come to be expected with AAA releases.
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  's expansion pack,
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  , included a home base for Geralt that can be given functional and aesthetic upgrades. While this was only included as DLC,
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  should have a home base included as a part of the base game.
 </p>

 <p>
  Home bases are a great feature of any RPG because of their customization, mechanics, and having a place to gather for important character moments. Locking a home behind DLC doesn't need to happen since
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's apartments appeared in the base game.
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  's Corvo Bianco is a great foundation for a strong home base in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  .

  Witchers roam the Continent as a part of their life on the Path, only returning to their Witcher School home base in the winter. However, Kaer Morhen isn't a replacement for an estate like Corvo Bianco, as seen in
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  . Corvo Bianco can be renovated and personalized, and it has a central location that's perfect for Geralt to return to in-between quests across the region. Kaer Mohren, as a fortress that's isolated in the mountains, requires several weeks' travel along perilous roads to get to and isn't in a position to be upgraded or maintained.

  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  could bring in a home base without needing to include it in DLC. A proper home for the player character is essential for mechanics such as storage and upgrades, but a home can also go further to be interactive and include aesthetic and functional upgrades. This can include armor, weapon, and collectible displays, decorations, and perhaps improving alchemy or weapons. Unlocking a home early in-game could mean that this feature could grow with the player character, with improvements reflecting the player's progress through the campaign.

  Improving on Corvo Bianco for The Witcher 4
 </h3>
 <p>
  A home base in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  could be based on Corvo Bianco, with some additional improvements that could be added on as the game's campaign progresses, such as a weapon's smith. Bonuses that Corvo Bianco offers when fully upgraded, such as bonus XP when killing monsters thanks to the upgraded Library, are another way to utilize a home base in ways that reward renovation. Characters from Geralt's story can visit Corvo Bianco and even remain at the estate permanently, but because
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  is a DLC, this stay is only for a short time. If the home base is there for the entirety of the campaign, allies could come and go, or perhaps even remain permanently.

      <title>6 Great Games That Feature Terraforming</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Space exploration and survival are common tropes in video games. However, there are not many games that address the problem of actually surviving on a planet other than Earth (in any way other than constructing a safe habitat such as a base). The more complex solution is to terraform an entire planet so that it can sustain life.

 <p>
  Terraforming a planet would be a huge, complex project. So, it is no surprise that game developers have not often taken on the challenge of creating a game based on changing an entire planet. However, there are a handful of terraforming games available, some of which are really very good and fun to play.

  Most games that focus on terraforming of some sort sit well within the strategy genre, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    Terraforming Earth
   </strong>
  </em>
  is different. This is a 2D, side-scrolling roguelike game. Each playthrough is completely different, as almost everything is procedurally generated in this game.

 <p>
  The Earth has suffered a catastrophe, and the player must take control of three funny little robots, guiding them through multiple platform levels and solving puzzles as they go. As the player progresses, the terraforming project moves forward. Be warned, though; this is a very hard game. Just because it has cute, almost quirky graphics, doesn’t mean it plays like a simple mobile game.
  <em>
   Terraforming Earth
  </em>
  offers a significant challenge.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Terraforming Mars

  </strong>
  , the player takes control of a corporation that is competing — economically and technically — to turn Mars into a viable, livable planet with a fully sustainable ecosystem. Basic goals include establishing a breathable atmosphere and creating oceans. As Mars becomes safer to live on, and terraforming moves forward, settlers will emigrate from Earth to the planet.

  The terraforming project is complex, and the player will need to acquire resources and set up integrated production chains to make the required materials. Cities need to be built and agricultural areas designated. Overall,

  is, at heart, an isometric colony-building game, but with a twist. In order for the player to build and expand a colony on Mars, it first needs to be terraformed. A range of tools are provided to help accomplish this task. As terraforming progresses, additional colony options open up.

  The terraforming project requires power, and the player needs to establish a reliable source of energy for this. Additionally, specific resources need to be mined and harvested. And of course, workers are needed. If the player runs out of space on the surface of Mars,

   <em>
    Terraformers
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a slick, good-looking strategy game that exploits procedural generation to ensure that no two playthroughs are the same. Once again, the player is tasked with terraforming the Red Planet, Mars. Exploration plays a significant role in this game. The player has access to certain hero units — leaders who can be sent to scout the map and uncover natural wonders.

 <p>
  This is a turn-based strategy game, and at the beginning of each turn, the player chooses from a number of randomly selected cards to decide what actions will take place during that turn. This can include constructing colony buildings, assigning orders to leaders, and deciding what resources to harvest.

  In
  <em>
   <strong>

  , Mars is, yet again, the target of a terraforming project. However, this is a game that really gets the complexity and enormity of such a project across. The goal is for the player to make Mars a viable environment to support life — and also to create a massive, interconnected infrastructure that covers the entire planet.

 <p>
  Technologies need to be researched, and materials must be located and acquired to progress with terraforming. The player is free to play either the fully scripted and voice-acted campaign, or simply enjoy a relaxed sandbox experience. A nice addition to this terraforming game is the cooperative mode for up to four players. There are several expansions available for
  <em>

  , which can help to keep gameplay fresh for quite a while.

   <em>
    Planet Crafter
   </em>
  </strong>
  deserves its place at the top of this list. It plays very much like a space survival game in first-person mode but with the goal of terraforming a whole planet. Toward this goal, the player will need to track down certain resources and find areas of the map where they can be harvested. This is easier said than done, as the rarer resources are only available in very specific, hard-to-access places.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  As the game progresses, the player will begin constructing machinery to terraform the planet. This includes special drills that relieve tectonic pressure to prevent earthquakes and huge heaters that will raise the temperature of the whole planet.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":905} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Of course, a viable atmosphere must be created, and the player will need to construct seed nurseries and biodomes to begin spreading genetically engineered seeds across the planet. The terraforming project is further complicated by parts of the planet flooding as water content rises. If the player’s base happens to be in an area that floods, well, it is time to start again somewhere else.

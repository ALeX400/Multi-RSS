  It's been almost 20 years since a mainline
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  game has hit store shelves, so it's safe to say that many fans are pretty pumped to check out
  <strong>
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
  </strong>
  once it launches on August 29, 2024. However, it's worth noting that fans can start playing the action RPG a little bit earlier than the majority. We have all the details for the
  <strong>
   release time for
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
  </strong>
  on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (Steam), so keep reading to find out more.

  Square Enix has not published a release time infographic for
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  (if they do, we'll update this post), but for now, we have a clear idea of when it'll come out.

   The $59.99 standard edition of
   <strong>
    <em>
     Visions of Mana
    </em>
    should be released on August 29, 2024, at midnight Eastern time (12 AM)
   </strong>
   .
  </span>
  This release timing is for the Xbox and PlayStation versions. However, it seems that the Steam (PC) version of
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  will probably launch around noon ET on August 29, 2024, a couple of hours after its console counterparts

  But, as we mentioned before, there is a way to
  <strong>
   play
   <em>
    Visions of Mana

   an entire day early

 <p>
  The big draw for the Deluxe package of
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  is the ability to access it 24 hours before its official launch. That means, if you're on a console, you can play
  <strong>
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
   on August 28 at midnight Eastern time
  </strong>
  . As for Steam, it should be available around noon ET on August 28, 2024.

 <p>
  The special edition also comes with the
  <strong>

  The main gameplay of
  <em>
   Anime Card Battle
  </em>
  is the constant roll of Cards with different rarities. The higher the rarity of the Card, the more difficult it is to get. However, some copies require special conditions to be met. Therefore, in this guide, we will tell you how to get the Manhwa Pack in
  <em>
   Anime Card Battle
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  When you first start your adventure in
  <em>
   Anime Card Battle
  </em>
  , you will immediately receive the Normal Pull Pack. With its help, you can get most of the Cards. However, there is also a second Pack in the game, which allows the player to roll Cards from popular Manhwa titles.
  <strong>
   So, to get the Manhwa Pack in
   <em>
    Anime Card Battle
   </em>
   , you need to roll at least 100,000 times
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  And in reality, it is as difficult as it sounds. Even with Fast Rolls activated, you will still need a large amount of time to reach the goal. Therefore, if you are a new player, then you should just progress and defeat bosses. This way, you will be able to get Potions and charms that will help speed up the progression.

 <p>
  When you finally reach the 100,000 roll mark, you need to visit the Card Packs NPC. It is located near the Potion Shop. After that, you only need to interact with it to get the coveted Manhwa Pack in

  Some of the biggest games released over the last few decades have been open-world RPGs. These addictive games drop players into huge worlds with no set path and allow them to find their own unique way. With vast maps to explore, quests to complete, and secrets to uncover, these large-scale games offer hundreds of hours of gameplay.

 <p>
  Over the years, these games have grown to incredible sizes and presented lands with rich histories and cultures. However, as with many modern games, the story doesn't always end with the base game. DLCs allow developers to expand and sometimes improve on their games. They often move into darker themes and can offer a higher level of challenge. Many DLCs even add large new maps to their games, providing players with many more hours of content.

  Plagued with technical issues from the beginning, the sprawling open-world sci-fi RPG,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  , had one of the worst video game releases in history. Since then, the game has come a long way, fixing its myriad of optimization issues and finally finding a larger audience. Much of this turnaround was in part thanks to its excellent expansion,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phantom Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The DLC acted as a relaunch of the game, showcasing the many improvements that had been added, and it also featured Hollywood star Idris Elba. The game introduced a new district to the map, called Dogtown, a new skill tree, and new weapons and vehicles. The expansion follows the main character V, a mercenary for hire, on a mission to save the President of the United States, who has crash-landed in Dogtown.

  Before the titanic successes of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  made Bethesda the AAA developer it is today,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
   </em>
  </strong>
  sat as their greatest achievement.
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  is a large open-world fantasy RPG that is beloved by its loyal fanbase. While it has its rough edges, like many Bethesda games,
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  presents a stunning fantasy world, with several towns and cities scattered throughout the map.

  While
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  is set within a magical realm, its brilliant DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Shivering Isles,
   </em>
  </strong>
  would take the game on stranger paths. Here, players are transported to the realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, where they get to explore a vibrant world filled with strange giant plants, colorful skies, and dangerous enemies. The game is set around the Greymarch, where the Forces of Order fight against Chaos.
  <em>
   The Shivering Isles
  </em>
  is a fun adventure that sits perfectly against the grand story told in the base game and is one of the best Bethesda has produced.

    Fallout 4

  is a huge open-world experience, filled with secret locations, warring factions, and mutated beasts. It takes players into the decimated nuclear remains of Boston, where the lone survivor of Vault 111, frozen for 210 years, awakens to search for their missing child, Shaun, in a strange, unfamiliar world. The game would introduce several DLCs, with most expanding on the base game’s core mechanics. However, its best overall expansion takes players to a whole new area.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Shadow over Innsmouth
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  ’s excellent DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Harbor
   </em>
  </strong>
  , is a welcome change from the base game.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  enjoys several high-quality DLCs that provide excellent new content to the game. However,
  <em>
   Far Harbor
  </em>
  stands out for its bleaker tone, strange new enemies, and a narrative that sits perfectly with the main quest of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . The game follows the player’s investigation into a missing girl, who has been taken in by a group of Synths, on the run from the Institute.
  <em>
   Far Harbor
  </em>
  is filled with new locations to explore, new quests to complete, and tough new challenges to take on.

  While their games are often imperfect, few developers have had as big an impact as Bethesda. For many, their crowning achievement is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The fifth entry in the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series takes players to a vast snowy landscape, filled with ancient ruins, mysterious caves, and mythical enemies. It introduced new magic and new mechanics to the series and was an instant classic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  ’s fantastic DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragonborn
   </em>
  </strong>
  , expanded on the lore and land of the game, taking players to the island of Solstheim, previously seen in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Morrowind
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In the expansion, players battle with the original Dragonborn, Miraak, and deal with Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of knowledge.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  ’s DLC moves quickly into cosmic horror territory, something often seen in Bethesda’s expansions.
  <em>
   Dragonborn
  </em>
  is the perfect addition to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . It provides hours of engaging content that is a welcome change from the base game but still feels like a part of the established world.

   <em>
    The Witcher 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is considered one of the best games ever made. It set a new standard for open-world RPGs with its living, breathing world. While the game’s first DLC offered a new storyline set within the established region, the second would take players to a whole new area.
  <strong>
   <em>

  Entering Toussaint, players find a sun-drenched land of noble knights, rolling vineyards, and ravenous vampires. Where the base game presents a grim, medieval feeling, with dark forests, dangerous swamps, and ravaged battlefields,
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  offers a welcome change. The game follows Geralt’s investigation into a string of murders that becomes a desperate battle with an ancient vampire.
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  is filled with dangerous enemies, new contracts, powerful weapons, and fun new characters, and it is the perfect end to a fantastic game.

  <strong>
   <em>

   </em>
  </strong>
  is the phenomenal new DLC to the modern action-rpg classic,
  <strong>

  . The DLC presents a huge new area that will test even veteran players’ resolve. On the trail of Miquella, the Tarnished ventures to the Land of Shadow to follow in the demigod’s footsteps, where tough new battles await. The game introduces many new characters, as well as new weapons, armor, and spells.

  raises the difficulty of

  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  is a worthy expansion to one of the highest-rated games in history and continues FromSoftware’s domination of the genre.

  When open-world games become the topic of conversation, games like
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  come to mind, and for good reason. Players who enjoy games with expansive worlds want an immersive experience that consoles and PCs have the storage space for.

  However, while a majority of open-world games can usually be found on consoles or PC, there are plenty of captivating worlds to explore on mobile. The mobile gaming market is one of the most underrated areas of the games industry. There are thousands of different games available for any type of gamer, from casual to competitive. There are also plenty of open-world games on mobile that, are not available on other platforms.

  Mobile gaming is now big enough that it has its own exclusive titles. Games like
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  are more popular than many triple-A games on PC or consoles while remaining exclusive to their original platform. This tradition has now grown into open-world games with some brilliant experiences available for mobile gamers.

  Before the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  series came to mobile with the remastered trilogy, the
  <em>
   Gangstar
  </em>
  franchise was the closest experience in the same genre for mobile gamers. Each installment in the series takes place in one of the cities in the United States, but none of them became as popular as
  <em>
   Gangstar: Vegas
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gangstar: New Orleans
  </em>
  .

  The latest entry in the series elevated the gameplay experience in the franchise by allowing players to buy their own private property and upgrade it over time, which turns into a luxury mansion in the end.
  <em>

  offers lots of action-packed missions in an online environment.

  <em>
   X Survive
  </em>
  is an open-world survival game that is pretty large in scope, making it quite impressive that this game works on mobile platforms. The game is a laid-back and relaxing experience, despite players having to manage their hunger, thirst, and fatigue, as is to be expected with most survival games.

  Players can scavenge for resources, craft items, and build everything from small houses to decently sized settlements. The game may not be the most polished title, but the sheer ambition present in this mobile open-world game is so impressive that most people will be floored at its sheer scope.

  puts a heavy focus on dodging, as there is a parry but it is tied to a specific spell. While most dodges will be a basic dodge to get out of the way, players can land a perfect dodge that will set you up greatly for a counterattack.

  There are many additional upgrades players can unlock to make their perfect dodges more effective, with one of them being the Vengeful Mirage upgrade. While it may take players some time to unlock this upgrade, it is well worth the effort for those who have mastered the perfect dodge.

  Vengeful Spirit leaves behind an
  <strong>
   illusion after you land a perfect dodge that will explode after a second
  </strong>
  . The mirage will be placed wherever you first start to dodge animation and will explode after about a second without any trigger necessary from the player. While the in-game description for this ability calls it an explosion, it may not be as big and spectacular as you'd think.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1024} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The explosion will detonate from the mirage, but visually it amounts to little more than a few sparks shooting out in every direction from the mirage, and
  <strong>
   sometimes won't be noticeable to the player
  </strong>
  depending on the distance and background. While it may not look amazing visually, Vengeful Mirage can deal a decent bit of dodge for a dodge upgrade, and there is no limit to how many enemies it can hit.

 <p>
  The only trick to using this skill efficiently is that you'll need to
  <strong>
   land a perfect dodge to make the mirage
  </strong>
  , and that requires a dodge at the last second before an attack hits you. You'll know you landed a perfect dodge as time will slow down for a brief moment, much like landing Evanescence. Landing a perfect dodge every time will take practice, and is easiest against large enemies with slow attack animations, and players should practice perfect dodging whenever possible.

 <p>
  Vengeful Mirage is a great skill players should unlock right away, as it can be unlocked and forgotten. Overall, players should always aim to get perfect dodges, and this upgrade only adds a bonus for when they do land. While the damage may not be a ton against a boss, landing multiple perfect dodges throughout a fight will slowly add up, and
  <strong>
   require no additional effort outside their usual play style
  </strong>
  .

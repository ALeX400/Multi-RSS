   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Fans are speculating that The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker could be coming to the Switch.
     </li>
     <li>
      Many past Zelda games were only translated into Korean when they were ported to the handheld console.
     </li>
     <li>
      Nintendo of Korea briefly listed The Wind Waker in Korean on its website, suggesting it may be coming to Nintendo Switch soon.

 <p>
  Fans think they might have spotted more evidence for a
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
   </strong>
  </em>
  Switch port. Nintendo has brought many old
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  titles to the Switch either through remasters or its virtual console feature, but Toon Link's debut has yet to see an updated version since its Wii U remaster. That hasn't stopped
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  fans from hoping, though, as rumors and speculation about an upcoming re-release are as prominent as ever.

 <p>
  Earlier in 2024, users spotted a listing for a
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  Switch version on a Russian retailer's website, sparking hope that official news of the game may not be far off. Nintendo still has not said anything about bringing the GameCube classic to the current generation, but that has not discouraged
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  players from digging for clues. One fan thinks they might have found something now.

 <p>
  The new theory comes from Redditor Dabeastmanz23, who posted a lengthy thread about clues from the game's Korean release. As they point out,
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  never got an official Korean translation, even when the Wii U remaster came out, as the Wii U was not released in South Korea. However, Nintendo has translated Wii U-era
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games into Korean as they've brought them to the Switch.
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors —
  </em>
  seen by many fans as one of the best games on the Wii U — finally got a Korean translation in its Switch port, for example. Dabeastmanz23 noticed that the Nintendo of Korea website briefly listed
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  in Korean, not English, suggesting it could be getting similar treatment.

 <p>
  The website now lists
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  in English again, as it does with all the other
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games that never got an official Korean translation. Still, the fact that it appeared in Korean for a moment could have been an instance of Nintendo accidentally revealing its hand too early. If the company was not making a Switch version of the game, it seems odd that they'd go through the trouble of translating information about it. Some fans point out that another
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  remaster would align with Nintendo's release schedule, which makes the theory sound less far-fetched.

 <p>
  Of course, the Korean listing for
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  could be a mistake. Dabeastmanz23 admits that Nintendo may have begun a translation for the Wii U remaster but never finished it, and that's where the translated title and description come from. Regardless, if Nintendo is working on an updated version of the game, it likely won't come out before the end of the year. With the upcoming Switch 2 in line for a 2025 release, it may make the most sense for Nintendo to wait until the new console is out.

  <em>
   Skateboard Legends

  is a great game where you can have fun skateboarding and performing tricks and even pass obstacle courses. Throughout the game, you can also upgrade your character, such as buying a new skateboard or other cool stuff, but of course, you'll need a lot of game currency for that.

  Fortunately, redeeming
  <em>
   Skateboard Legends
  </em>
  codes is not difficult, and a similar redemption system is often found in other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games. However, if you have no experience with redeeming codes, or do not understand how it works in
  <em>
   Skateboard Legends
  </em>
  , here is a detailed guide:

   Launch

  <li>
   Look at the top right corner of the screen. There will be a Settings button. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   In this way, you will open a menu with a bunch of options and buttons. At the top you will find the redemption option, which will contain an input field and a green Enter button next to it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now enter one of the working codes from the list above into the input field.

   Lastly, click on the green Enter button to submit your reward request.

      <title>Nintendo Switch 2's 3-Version Rumors Explained</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  As the curtain closes on 2024, Nintendo fans are still waiting for news about the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch successor
  </strong>
  . Having been announced by the company president, Shuntaro Furukawa, midway through the year, the unofficially-dubbed “Switch 2” has become one of the worst secrets of the game industry. Leaks and rumors about its appearance, its hardware specs, and even a couple of its launch games feel like they've dropped every other week, and even Nintendo has confessed on social media that the console will be backwards compatible with the first Switch. At this point, a proper announcement can't be far off.

 <p>
  When that news is coming might be the most mysterious detail about the Switch 2, but the intensity of the leaks and Nintendo’s marketing patterns suggest it's just weeks away. The Game Awards 2024 may not have included any Switch teasers in spite of a third-party advertisement leaking just before the show, but 2025 could see a Switch reveal as early as January. It's also possible that Nintendo will replace its expected February Direct with the Switch 2’s info blowout. Regardless of when it comes, a new rumor has suggested that the Switch 2’s premiere won't just show one version of the console.

  Around the middle of December 2024, an anonymous Reddit user going by NextHandheld claimed to have obtained a finalized Switch 2 unit. Having been OK-ed by r/NintendoSwitch2 moderators, NextHandheld proceeded to answer questions and corroborate existing information, with the promise of more public evidence of their find supposedly coming on Christmas day. Among their claims was that the Nintendo Switch successor could release in mid-March, considerably earlier than the recent community theory of June or July, and that there would be multiple color schemes available for the console at launch. These colors are:

 <ul>
  <li>
   A gray system with black buttons
  </li>
  <li>
   A white system
  </li>
  <li>
   A special edition Switch 2 themed after a particular game

 <p>
  Different cosmetic options are all that these takes on the Nintendo Switch successor amount to, and that makes sense. Although the current Nintendo Switch does have the Nintendo Switch Lite and the Nintendo Switch OLED as alternate models, they do not have meaningfully different features. Other eighth and ninth generation consoles released half-step “Pro” consoles and split skews, like the Xbox Series X and Series S, but Nintendo never gave the Switch the same treatment, and this may hold true for the Switch 2.

  The different colors ascribed to each Nintendo Switch successor correspond to existing Switch colors, and major ones at that. Although some fans will associate the red and blue Joy-Cons with the original 2017 launch of the Switch, there actually was a primarily gray version with black buttons available at the time. Meanwhile, a white Nintendo Switch 2 sounds like a dead ringer for the main Nintendo Switch OLED model that launched in October 2021. These aren't especially flashy colors to launch with, but they are a good baseline to set before other colors roll in.

  Speculating What The Special Edition Switch 2 Could Refer To
 </h3>
 <p>
  However, the original Nintendo Switch took several months to get themed special editions. By the sounds of it, the Nintendo Switch successor might launch with one, although what game it corresponds to and whether it’s part of a bundle haven't been specified. Current theories point towards a
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  limited edition Switch 2, though it could be just about any Nintendo game or IP. Whether or not any of this proves true remains to be seen, but this just adds another trait to hope for when the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  is finally revealed in full.

  Once the photo has been taken, players should speak with Jane and show her the picture to complete the Companion's Group Photo quest and claim the associated rewards. Those rewards are 30 Diamonds in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  and 30,000 Bling, and fans will undoubtedly be happy to earn them. In particular, players are likely to be excited about the Diamonds that they receive, as they can be used to buy the Crystals that are put toward rolling on the game's various Resonance banners.

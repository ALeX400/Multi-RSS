      <title>Every Chao Featured in Sonic X Shadow Generations Explained</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic X Shadow Generations
   </strong>
  </em>
  primarily serves to introduce fans of the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  movies to everything that makes the games special. With
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  being designed as a sort of interactive history museum for the mainline games,
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  comes in as a playable overview of Shadow the Hedgehog as a character, which was released just prior to
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog 3
  </em>
  's theatrical debut. That said,
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  is one title that die-hard fans won't want to miss out on, as though it may act as an introductory title for many new players, it resurrects long-standing series lore to create a package full of references, nostalgia, and even closure for fans of
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shadow the Hedgehog
  </em>
  .

  One of the additions made to the newly remastered
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  is the Chao Rescue feature. According to the head of Sonic Team, the Chao Rescue feature was introduced so players who knew the original
  <em>
   Generations
  </em>
  front-to-back would find new things to excite them throughout their newest playthrough. In each level, players can find three Chao that are lost and need to be guided back to White Space. Based on early press screenshots, and from previous attempts at including Chao in games like
  <em>
   Team Sonic Racing
  </em>
  , it was easy to assume that it would be the standard Neutral, Dark, and Hero Chao that were scattered in each stage. Now that the game is out, though, the variety of Chao to save is incredibly impressive.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Act 1: Neutral Chao, Hero Chao, NiGHTS Chao
  </li>
  <li>
   Act 2: Dark Chao, "Light" Chaos Chao, Swim-Fly Dark Chao
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  A key aspect of Chao that makes the critters so special is their evolution and alignment dynamics. The Neutral Chao serves as the starting form a Chao can take, while the standard Dark and Hero Chao represent the alignments respectively. Beyond these three, however, there are so many possibilities that it's hard to count them all. Few of these forms have had significant representation outside
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  , so it's rather surprising to see so many of them appear in
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  after so long.
 </p>
 <p>
  Which form a Chao takes is decided by the many choices the player makes in the
  <em>
   Adventure
  </em>
  games. The blue-and-black Chao found in Modern Sonic's Green Hill Zone level, for instance, can only be obtained by raising a Chao with a Dark character like Shadow while giving them swim-stat-boosting Chaos Drives and animals. Once the Chao evolves, players can then give their Chao fly-stat-boosting items to create the very same Swim-Fly Dark Chao for themselves. There are three specific Chao that can be raised to look like Sonic and Shadow, but one Chao has been dubbed to be the "NiGHTS" Chao by fans. This is the fully Fly Neutral Chao found in Classic Sonic's Green Hill Zone.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Act 1: Fully Swim Neutral Chao, two-tone sky-blue Chao with an egg hat on its head, fully grown base Hero Chao
  </li>
  <li>
   Act 2: Swim Dark Chao, adult Neutral-Power Chao, Swim-Power Dark Chao
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This set of Chao is where the diversity in the Rescue feature really shines, as both the characteristic expressions and optional hats Chao can wear are shown off in Chemical Plant Zone. Some fans might mistake Classic Sonic's Hero Chao for the original one, but the markings and shape of its rounded points on the top of its head are slightly different to denote its age. Another interesting thing fans may not notice is how two of the Dark Chao feature a unique expression here, when Dark Chao often have a sort of angry expression in their eyes at all times.

 <p>
  Sky Sanctuary features a solid red Chao that fans should recognize from a Black Market Chao egg. Out of all the Chao that have gone unrecognized by the series in recent years, these are one of the most excluded. The two-tone egg-wearing Chao from Chemical Plant Zone is similar in that two-tone Chao of different colors than normal can only be obtained through breeding.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Act 1: Fly-Power Hero Chao with a pot for a hat, Adult Dark-Power Chao, Neutral Power Chao
  </li>
  <li>
   Act 2: Adult Hero-Power Chao, "Devil" Dark Chaos Chao, fully grown Run Neutral Chao
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Due to the pot that's on the first Chao fans will find in Act 1, it's hard to tell exactly which Power Hero Chao it is. Out of all the Chao featured in
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , only one of the same types is shown twice, and the Fly-Power Hero Chao is the closest to its body markings. Chaos Chao, like the "Light" Chaos Chao from earlier, are special types that can only be raised when certain conditions are met. This includes giving a Chao at least one of every animal found in
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  , so getting a Chaos Chao is a rather prestigious achievement for fans. The names "Light", "Devil", and "Angel" for them are fan-made as well. It's also possible that the adult Run Neutral Chao was included to serve as a "Classic Sonic" Chao.

  <li>
   Act 2: Fully Swim Hero Chao, Sonic Chao, Swim-Run Hero Chao
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Just like the NiGHTS Chao, the Sonic Chao can be made by continuing to give run-type items to a Chao that's evolved into a Run-Neutral Chao. It'll be a gradual transformation, but one that's worth it as the Sonic Chao is s splitting image of the blue blur. Due to its likeness to the most famous hedgehog, the Sonic Chao is incredibly popular with fans.

  Out of all the character Chao fans know, the Knuckles Chao is one of three interesting cases. Unlike the Sonic, Shadow, and NiGHTS Chao, Knuckles, Tails, and Amy Chao were given away on special discs at special events in Japan and rarely at any other time. The only one that made its way to other regions officially was the Tails Chao, which could be given away through
  <em>
   Phantasy Star Online
  </em>
  Episode 1 and II. As a result, games like
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  are some of the few official chances these special character Chao get to shine.

 <p>
  Raising a Shadow Chao is very similar to how a Sonic Chao is raised; giving an evolved Chao run-type items for them to gradually become a Shadow Chao. However, the biggest and only difference is that the Shadow Chao is a Dark Chao, meaning that they need to be raised with a Dark character like Shadow himself. It takes patience, but fans of Shadow would likely enjoy raising this Chao for themselves thanks to the resemblance alone.

     Those looking to raise a Shadow Chao in

     get around the lack of Dark characters by giving their Chao Dark Fruit from the Black Market. The same goes for any Hero Chao players would like to raise.

      <title>How Does Damage Calculation Work in Monster Hunter Wilds</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Ever wondered why the attack value seen in a weapon’s details screen in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is so much bigger than the actual floating damage numbers that you see when the weapon is being actively used on a monster?

  Players new to the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise are often confused by this fact, and rightfully so. The damage numbers on the status screen and the ones in practice are entirely different, and the game doesn’t make any effort at all in explaining why. The reason for this is a background damage calculation formula that isn’t shown to the players on a status screen or in a menu, but operates in the background. Here is how it works.

  There are three values inherent to every weapon in
  <em>
   MH Wilds
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Attack:
   </strong>
   This is raw physical attack value.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Affinity:
   </strong>
   Critical Hit Chance
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Element:
   </strong>
   Elemental attack damage/Status Effect infliction.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Let’s take a Long Sword, the Iron Katana I, which has 396 Attack damage, 0% Affinity, and 0 Elemental damage as an example. The Attack value of this weapon shows as 396. However, this is a
  <strong>
   bloated number that doesn’t represent the actual DPS
  </strong>
  . The first order of business in understanding what a weapon does is to
  <strong>
   de-bloat
  </strong>
  this value and determine its real damage number. Unlike previous
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  games where players had to manually calculate and crunch numbers to determine this,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has a menu option that can be toggled on that automatically does this for them.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Open the Start Menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go to System -&gt; Options -&gt; Game Settings -&gt; Weapon Attack Power Display
  </li>
  <li>
   Change the setting to Display Without Coefficient.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Now, the weapons will show their true attack values only.

 <p>
  The Iron Katana I’s attack value is shown as 120. This number is still larger than most swings of this weapon, and players will find that, in most cases, it will deal only 30-50 damage, which is obviously a much lower number than 120. This is because of
  <strong>
   hidden modifiers
  </strong>
  that multiply with a weapon’s attack value before it hits a monster. These modifiers are applied to a weapon’s attack value, reducing this number further down.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Motion Value:
   </strong>
   Hidden multiplier unique to individual attack moves of every weapon.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sharpness:
   </strong>
   Buff/Debuff related to weapon sharpness level.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Monster Weakness/resistance:
   </strong>
   A monster’s vulnerability to certain attack types (blunt/cut/ammo).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Quest Difficulty:
   </strong>
   The harder the quest, the less damage the monster takes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Rage Status:

  Attack Damage Calculation Formula

  Combined, the formula for calculating how much attack damage a weapon will deal is as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Attack Formula:
   </strong>
   Attack Value x Motion Value x Weapon Sharpness x Monster Weakness x Quest Difficulty x Rage Status x Affinity (if present)

 <h3 id="what-is-motion-value">
  What Is Motion Value
 </h3>
 <p>
  Every combo in a weapon’s moveset has a different motion value attributed to it. A normal Long Sword swing, for example, may have a Motion Value of 0.2. This means that if you swing a weapon with a true attack value of 120, a motion value of 0.2 will be applied to it, resulting in:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   120 x 0.2 = 24
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Now, 24 is the damage being done with that weapon. But on the next swing, the motion value will be different, because every attack has a different motion value. If it is 0.35, then:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   120 x 0.35 = 42
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  And so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slow weapons like the Great Sword always have a higher motion value than comparable attacks from faster weapons. This is meant to balance things out so that over the course of a prolonged fight, the overall damage of weapons of the same tier is the same.

  . This guide is accessible from Start Menu -&gt; Info -&gt; Monster Field Guide -&gt; Large Monster Field Guide.

 <p>
  As long as a player has encountered/hunted a large monster, this guide will detail every single weakness of a monster’s individual body parts, the breakable part of its body, effective status effects, and even possible rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three types of attack damage (blunt, sever, ammo) are shown in the weaknesses chart in front of every monster body part. The more stars there are, the more effective those types of attacks will be.

  After reaching High Rank, players will find that they have to beat the same monsters they beat during Low Rank once more. But if these monsters had the same HP levels as the ones in Low-Rank, an endgame weapon would destroy them within seconds. This is why the harder quests in the game add a multiplier to a monster’s HP and resistances to avoid it being steamrolled.

  Elemental Damage is not a part of the Attack value formula because it exists separately and is layered on top of the Attack after the formula has been applied to it first. The formula for calculating Elemental damage is mostly the same as the one for Attack damage but with a few key differences. It is:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Elemental Attack Formula:
   </strong>
   Elemental Attack Value / 10 x Elemental Motion Value x Weapon Sharpness x Monster Weakness x Quest Difficulty x Rage Status
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The differences are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Elemental Motion Value is different from Attack Motion Value. It is more consistent overall and hovers around 1x for most attacks, unlike Attack MV, which can get as low as 0.1.
  </li>
  <li>
   Weapon Sharpness applies differently to Elemental attacks compared to raw physical attacks. It is more stringent with Elemental Attacks.
  </li>
  <li>
   Affinity does not apply to Elemental attacks, which means these attacks cannot be critical hits. The only exception is when using the Critical Element Skill.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_41">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The Display without Coefficient toggle does not de-bloat the Elemental Attack value, only the Attack value. However, players can easily determine the true Elemental attack value by dividing the number by 10.

  ’s Triumphant Light introduced four new Supporters, and many players consider Irida the best among them. She offers a powerful healing effect, restoring up to 160 HP across four Pokemon—each receiving 40 HP. Previously, Erika held the top spot for healing, but her effect only removed 50 damage. This makes Irida’s healing nearly 220% stronger in comparison.

  Irida’s main rival in the new miniset is Celestic Town Elder—better known as Grandma—who can revive a Basic card. However, excluding her, Irida could easily be considered the strongest new Trainer card in

  ’s Irida shares a similar healing effect with Erika but differs in two key ways: it only applies to Pokemon with Water Energy attached and heals all eligible Pokemon rather than just one. For example, if you have three damaged Pokemon on the board, each with at least one Water Energy, Irida will heal 40 damage from each.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes Irida unique is that her effect depends on the attached Energy type rather than the Pokemon’s type. This means, in theory, she can heal any Pokemon as long as it has Water Energy, making her incredibly versatile. One deck, discussed below, has already leveraged this synergy by using Irida to heal Grass-type Pokemon. And with upcoming expansions,
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  ’s metagame is likely to see even more creative strategies built around her.

 <p>
  Irida has found an unexpected home in the new Leafeon ex &amp; Celebi ex deck. At first glance, pairing her with two Grass-type Pokemon seems counterintuitive, given that her effect only applies to cards with Water Energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Leafeon ex’s Energy-generating ability, combined with Celebi ex’s synergy with Colorless Energy, creates a clever workaround. By building the deck with Water Energy and using Leafeon ex’s ability to generate the necessary Grass Energy, both Pokemon become compatible with Irida’s healing effect, significantly boosting the deck’s durability.
 </p>
 <p>
  A quick look at
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  ’s current meta confirms that this synergy has paid off, with Irid’s Leafeon ex &amp; Celebi ex deck ranking among the top three competitors in PvP.

  In
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  ’s early days, Articuno ex was a dominant force in the 18-Trainer archetype. Players quickly realized that this critter didn’t need support from other Pokemon and could win matches solo, provided it was backed by synergizing Trainer Cards. For a time, Articuno ex’s 18-Trainer deck was a top-tier PvP option, though it eventually fell out of favor due to the rise of tanky setups with snipping capabilities.

  Now, with Irida’s arrival, the 18-Trainer archetype has made a comeback, once again placing Articuno ex among the top ten meta decks. However, Irida isn’t the only factor in its resurgence—Pokemon Tools like Giant Cape and Rocky Helmet also play a crucial role. When combined with Irida’s healing, these tools make Articuno ex incredibly durable, allowing it to withstand and counter high-damage decks effectively.

  The Palkia ex &amp; Vaporeon setup is perhaps the most obvious fit for Irida. This Water-focused deck revolves around Palkia ex’s burst damage, which comes with the drawback of Energy discard after each attack, making it risky to leave in the Active Spot. Normally, this would force frequent switching, but Irida provides a perfect workaround: healing Palkia ex to keep it in play longer and allowing for multiple attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Irida’s value in this deck extends beyond just Palkia ex.
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  ’s meta still features disruptive chip-damage decks like Magnezone &amp; Darkrai ex, which can slow down Palkia ex’s setup and target Vaporeon, a key support piece. With Irida, not only can you sustain Palkia ex, but you can also keep Vaporeon healthy on the Bench, as her effect applies to all Pokemon with Water Energy.

      <title>BioWare's Best Option for an Anthem Reboot May Not Be Anthem at All</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Despite renewed interest in a revival of BioWare's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Anthem
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the game might find better odds for a potential reboot if adopted by one of the studio's more well-known and well-established IPs. Since the days of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  and its original
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy, BioWare's recent track record has arguably been hit-and-miss between the likes of
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , but none more so than its short-lived MMORPG,
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  . However, while the game may have failed to meet expectations when it first launched, some players and even former producers are interested in rebooting
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  But given that its reputation and notoriety still live on years after its release, it may be too soon for an attempted reboot of
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  as its own IP. Yet
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  's best features, such as its gameplay and world-building, are still potentially worth salvaging, which could prompt BioWare to look for alternative options if it decides to revisit the game
  <em>
  </em>
  and attempt a reboot. Therefore, in line with
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  's overall design, gameplay, and setting, BioWare could take the MMORPG's better parts and adapt them to fit its stronger, more popular
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  IP to give
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  a deserved second chance to succeed.

 <p>
  With the conclusion of
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  's original trilogy and its
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series going strong following
  <em>
   DA: Inquisition
  </em>
  earning the Game of the Year award in 2014, it arguably wasn't surprising that BioWare would begin creating new IPs as it moved forward. However, despite its best intentions with
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  , BioWare's sudden departure from single-player experiences to the MMO genre didn't see the same success as its other games, with criticism ranging from a repetitive gameplay loop to a weak storyline and endgame. Even after BioWare attempted to rework the game and release post-launch content, development on
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  ceased in early 2021.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, likely prompted by EA's comments on
  <em>
   DA: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's mixed sales that it would have performed better with live-service gameplay, attention has turned to
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  as BioWare's original attempt at such a game. Though it may have been flawed at its initial launch, players looking back on
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  have begun to recognize the game's potential with social media posts like the one below highlighting its flight and combat gameplay. Despite this, with
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  's persisting damaged reputation and EA favoring established IPs like
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  in a bid for an MMO from BioWare, a direct reboot of the game itself might not be possible.
 </p>
 <h3 id="mass-effect-adopting-anthem-could-be-the-best-compromise">
  Mass Effect Adopting Anthem Could Be The Best Compromise
 </h3>
 <p>
  While it's possible that
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  deserves a second chance to redeem itself, it might be better for players, developers, and publishers if BioWare reworked its approach to
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  and adapted its gameplay and story to fit within the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  franchise. Given that the two IPs already share similarities in terms of design and gameplay, this potential
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  reboot would only require changes to its characters, story, and setting. In doing so,
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  could still retain the positives of its core gameplay while being supported by
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  's established canon, such as with the examples below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Freelancers could be replaced by Spectres.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fort Tarsis could be replaced by the Citadel.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Anthem
   </em>
   's factions could be replaced by
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
   's alien races and factions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scars could be replaced by the Reaper forces.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="mass-effect-could-be-both-anthem-39-s-and-bioware-39-s-best-way-forward">
  Mass Effect Could Be Both Anthem's and BioWare's Best Way Forward
 </h3>
 <p>
  However, despite assurances that
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  is still going ahead, BioWare's recent layoffs hint at an uncertain future that hinges on the successful continuation of its
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  IP. Given that this could put
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  under pressure to exceed all expectations, it might be wise to repurpose
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  's reboot within the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  series to help share the burden of success. With its flight and combat gameplay already proving popular among players, BioWare could benefit from rebooting
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  alongside M
  <em>
   ass Effect 4
  </em>
  to strengthen the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  IP through single-player and MMO games to ensure the studio's future.

      <title>Why Directive 8020's Multiplayer Could Be Its Most Ambitious Narrative Device</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/directive-8020-multiplayer-story-ambitious-interesting-trick/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As Supermassive Games continues to iterate on the branching narrative formula through its
  <em>
   Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Directive 8020
   </strong>
  </em>
  promises to be its most ambitious yet. Preview footage of
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  has proven promising for its mechanics - stealth, defensive tools (returning from
  <em>
   The Devil in Me
  </em>
  ), and otherwise - though the lingering question of just how involved player choice will be in the anthology's upcoming entry remains a point of speculation. With the many permutations that branching narratives need to consider,
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  looks to be heralding player agency more than ever, though how its five-player co-op will factor into its premise will be interesting to see.
 </p>

 <p>
  Multiplayer is no new feature of
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  . Co-op has, after all, been one of the biggest selling points of its titles, from its couch co-op "pass the game off" style to its online features. In the latter's case, however, the anthology has only ever accounted for two players acting on the story concurrently, while
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  is set to accommodate up to five. With five main characters in the Cassiopeia crew, it stands to reason that each player might control one character, though this would be incredibly ambitious if they were all playing the game simultaneously. Some fans have speculated that its online co-op will function instead as an extension of couch co-op, though if the former is true and players are indeed acting concurrently with each other, then
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  's multiplayer could be the perfect conduit for its 'The Thing' premise.

 <h3 id="speculating-on-directive-8020-39-s-online-multiplayer">
  Speculating on Directive 8020's Online Multiplayer
 </h3>
 <p>
  Multiplayer in games poses inherent mechanical challenges, a feat that
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  has had to consider in its QTEs and dialogue choice structure. Couple that with branching narratives, and there is a lot to contemplate in making these plots work. It is perhaps why earlier titles like
  <em>
   Man of Medan
  </em>
  have struggled a bit in their approach. As
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  titles have employed story twists that are tantamount to their respective plots, multiplayer runs the risk of revealing these twists too early, with players naturally expected to communicate with each other throughout the course of the game. Some might argue that this is intentional, though it can lessen the impact of later decisions down the road (at least, if players are trying to keep everyone alive).
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, in
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  's case, there's a fundamental reason why players might be working to the inverse of its characters' survival. Set to embody a type of space cosmic horror with an alien that both mutates and mimics, the game will mess with players' perceptions of who they are really interacting with. If players are acting online concurrently with one another, then they could both help and hurt other players' causes; perhaps prematurely dying in the game could cause a player to swap to the alien version of their character, enabling them to go on and actively sabotage those remaining. This is, of course, speculation, though it would make sense considering that players would be left hanging if they otherwise died earlier on in the course of the game.

 <h3 id="co-op-working-to-directive-8020-39-s-narrative-premise-subverting-expectations">
  Co-op Working to Directive 8020's Narrative Premise, Subverting Expectations
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  's main narrative conceit is set to contend not just with the Cassiopeia crew's survival, but also the home they have left behind. Its game page emphasizes this: "to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth." It is an interesting point to highlight in a game set aboard a claustrophobic spaceship, where choices will reverberate beyond the main characters and onto the planet they are twelve light years away from. If this moral point is highlighted in
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  to the extent that fans should aim to have their characters all die rather than survive, then it could be an equally interesting subversion of the past
  <em>
   Dark Pictures
  </em>
  ' formula while working to the strengths of its multiplayer, should players be allowed to deceive each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of how
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  winds up structuring its multiplayer, it is clear that the title will be at
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  ' most iterative. With a release date set for later this year, it is also refreshing to see how Supermassive has given its developers more time to work with healthy pacing, accounting for the hurdles evidenced in the anthology's past. As Supermassive continues to take fan critique into account and work to adapt accordingly,
  <em>
   Directive 8020
  </em>
  is shaping up to be an intriguing start to the next of what
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  has to offer, though how much death it packs into its space horror premise could be left up to players to determine.

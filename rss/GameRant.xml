  While it may be tempting for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  players to create a class that works well in all situations, sometimes the map design or pace of a match brings out a need to get into the thick of it. As such, a more specialized firearm at close range may prove more effective than a tried-and-true all-rounder.
 </p>
 <p>
  From uniquely effective assault rifles and submachine guns to takedown-worthy melee weapons and close-combat shotguns, Black Ops 6's arsenal is varied enough to allow players of all playstyles to prosper in close-quarters firefights.

  While it obviously lacks any sort of range and is best utilized when used as either a pseudo-parkour blade or a last-ditch final resort, the knife remains arguably the best weapon at close range.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to the other melee weapons of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer, it is undoubtedly the best. While the baseball bat and power drill certainly have a more dramatic flair, the one-hit-ko potential of the knife is indisputably its best feature. However, despite its devastating lethality, its lack of any range neuters its capabilities and its best use is arguably as a supplement for the other weapons on this list.

  Although many of the weapons in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's varied arsenal can be devastating at their proven specialization, not all firearms can effectively cater to the changing needs of a
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  fan's playstyle. As such, the KSV's all-round versatility certainly makes it extremely effective at short range yet it can be outfitted to specialize its use for all sorts of engagement scenarios.
 </p>
 <p>
  A decent rate of fire and a lack of any discernable core weaknesses form this seeming reputation of the KSV as a submachine gun with great modularity. While it can work at somewhat medium to longer ranges, like many of its SMG compatriots its natural habitat is at close range - where it can produce a consistent and devastating level of damage.

  As a shotgun, the ASG-89 by design is incredibly effective in short-range gunfights and its semi-automatic firing mode is a simple counterbalance to many of its contemporaries' hindrances.
 </p>
 <p>
  While other shotguns such as the pump-action Marine SP bestow the user with excellent damage potential at close range, its inconsistent damage output hinders what can be a devastating firearm. As such, with its semi-automatic fire and tightest spread of its type, the ASG-89 is not only fatal at close range but can consistently earn kills - effectively making it arguably the best shotgun in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer arsenal as of writing.

  Although the real-life MP5 submachine gun has found its way into many video game armories,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6'
  </em>
  s MP5-inspired C9 strays from pigeonholing the SMG as a purely close-range firearm.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a relatively steady fire rate when compared to its fellow SMGs, the C9 allows its user a much greater level of accuracy and bestows a jack-of-all-trades firearm to be utilized well in most engagements. Available straight out of the gate when players are initially permitted to use the create-a-class system at level 4, as such the C9 is arguably one of the accessible weapons of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer. While certainly very capable at longer ranges, its natural placement as an SMG ensures that it decimates at close range.

  With the slowest fire rate by far when compared to any of its fellow SMGs, the Tanto .22 effectively runs counter to many of the expectations of the submachine gun class. However, with many attachments allowing for this hindrance to be countered, the Tanto .22's extremely high damage per shot ensures that it remains "a heavy hitter up close".
 </p>
 <p>
  Being unlocked at level 16, the Tanto .22 is a weapon that players will have their hands on relatively early on in their
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  multiplayer experience. As such, especially with its versatility at longer ranges and ability to counter its most glaring weakness, the Tanto .22 is arguably not only one of the most effective close-range firearms in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's arsenal but one of the title's most uniquely devastating weapons.

  Although Black Ops 6's close-range options are incredibly varied, the utilization of shotguns, SMGs, and melee weapons arguably dominate the close-quarters firefights of the 2024 FPS. As such, the overwhelming close-range effectiveness of the AS VAL - an assault rifle with a built-in suppressor - is a pleasantly surprising change of pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  With its aforementioned built-in suppressor, the AS VAL allows for greater modularity with one less thing for players to worry about when choosing between
  <em>
   Black Ops 6'
  </em>
  s tightly wound attachment system. Although it suffers from a relatively slow rate of fire and a small magazine, even when compared to its fellow assault rifles, both of these seeming weaknesses can be countered easily with attachments. As such, in incorporating a more stealth-based playstyle and utilizing the AS VAL's high damage, players can peek into corners and tactically eliminate enemies while using what "may just be the best weapon for close-quarters combat".

  Although many of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's weapons benefit from great versatility in battle, there is something to be said for a firearm that is fatally effective in certain situations. As such, when using the Jackal PDW submachine gun, it is not recommended to take on enemies at longer ranges - however, taking on close-range targets is this weapon's bread and butter.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it can be made more versatile should players wish, arguably the best use of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's varied attachments is to double-down on the Jackal PDW's effectiveness in close-quarters engagements. With hard-hitting rounds and a manageable recoil, the Jackal PDW can not only win at close ranges but decimate.

  Although it may take a while to learn how to handle, the Kompakt 92 is "a standout option" for all players of
  <em>
   Call of Duty:
  </em>
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer. With a supremely strong recoil per its highest-in-class fire rate, the Kompakt 92 SMG is arguably second to none at purely putting damage downfield.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there are a multitude of attachment options to mitigate the Kompkt 92's arduous recoil, the best use of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's attachments is arguably going to be to increase its pitiful range if players wish to utilize it at longer ranges. However, in close-range engagements, even firing from the hip can be extremely viable when paired with an increased magazine of 60 rounds and a fire rate that empties that massive magazine in seconds flat.

  Gaming is expensive. Whether someone prefers consoles or PC, they will need to invest a fair amount of cash just to set up their stations. Once the hardware is ready to go, owners will need to turn to their platform's libraries to pick up some software. Nowadays, Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus grant access to massive selections of games for monthly fees; however, most AAA titles do not debut on these subscription services. Consequently, players could find themselves regularly dropping $69.99 to experience the latest exciting projects.

   </strong>
   As the new year slowly starts to pick up steam, more free-to-play games will be revealed, showcased, and dropped. 2024 ended up being a pretty great year for the free market, and there is nothing to suggest its successor will fail to maintain that high standard.

  Hero shooters are weird. On the one hand, the genre feels overexposed and tired; conversely, there are only a small handful of viable options on the market, basically all of which fall within the free-to-play scene. New contenders do not come around often, but when they do, they rarely seem to attract all that much excitement.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  was the first hero shooter since
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  to seemingly garner any significant momentum, a movement largely driven by its recognizable roster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  looks kind of great. While its initial reveal did not garner that much enthusiasm, a fairly successful open beta managed to garner some momentum in the project's favor, hopefully setting the stage for what will prove to be a worthwhile addition to an exhausted gameplay formula. So, what sets
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  apart from its contemporaries? The main selling point is Shard Cards, which are assigned to teams for each round. These have a wide impact on matches, providing both advantages and disadvantages; more importantly, they shake up the routine to provide consistent variety. Rounds are short too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond that,
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  seems to play well, at least going by the closed beta impressions. The 12 heroes all come with unique abilities and have pretty fun designs, which is important for this type of release.

  Grinding Gear's
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  enjoyed its 10th anniversary in 2023, and the game is still among the best free-to-play options on the market. Presented as an alternative to
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , the isometric action RPG delivers stellar customization, gameplay, and a lot of content that can be enjoyed without requiring any cash investment.
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  prides itself on not being pay-to-win, and the developer has generally stuck to that commitment. Now, the sequel is on the horizon, and it is shaping up to be an exciting expansion of an already beloved hack and slash dungeon crawler.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally, when an upcoming free project vows to deliver the stars and moon, skepticism should be the natural reaction; however, Grinding Gear's words are backed by years of generally good work. Therefore, when
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  's Steam description promotes a six-act campaign and extensive endgame content in the form of 100+ maps with unique boss fights, there is a chance that the final product might actually deliver on these promises.

  An argument could be made that the best
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  game of the last five years is a freebie that was randomly dropped on Steam.
  <em>
   The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  is shockingly good and an easy recommendation for fans of the franchise, as long as they do not mind a story-driven visual novel. As that worked so well, Sega looks set to dip into the free market once again, albeit with a very different project.
  <em>
   Sonic Rumble
  </em>
  is a 32-player multiplayer party game that seems to take a few lessons from
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  , with players competing in races and other survival-themed modes. Naturally, players will have access to a plethora of characters from across the franchise, beyond just the obvious ones like Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails.
 </p>
 <p>
  While probably better to not get too excited until more information is revealed regarding its Western release, which seems set to not include gacha mechanics,
  <em>
   Sonic Rumble
  </em>
  should be a fun time.
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  might no longer be at its peak popularity, but there is really nothing wrong with its core concept and gameplay loop; furthermore, Sega has the resources and the pedigree to push this peculiar multiplayer subgenre to the next level.

  Free-to-play games tend to target as wide of an audience as possible, hoping to attract the full circle rather than just a sliver. However, that is not always the case, and projects exist that are designed with a niche audience in mind.
  <em>
   Madoka Magica Magia Exedra
  </em>
  seems to be one of those releases, with the turn-based RPG game being set within the
  <em>
   Puella Magi Madoka Magica
  </em>
  universe. While the 2011 anime is popular and has previously spawned spin-offs and cross-media productions, it is still a relatively small IP, at least compared to franchises like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Although not synonymous with video games, this franchise has explored the industry before. There are a couple of handheld
  <em>
   Madoka Magic
  </em>
  games, along with a mobile title called
  <em>
   Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Madoka Magica Magia Exedra
  </em>
  seems set to be a replacement for the latter, offering a new free-to-play option that covers the entire IP rather than a specific part of it. The upcoming game seems to use gacha mechanics, allowing players to create a team of five magical girls. The turn-based combat looks fairly typical for the genre, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

  While still popular, battle royales do kind of feel like a thing of the past. At this point, the genre is dominated by a couple of evergreen releases, and any new names seem to struggle to make a dent when they must compete against established names like
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Many developers have tried to leave their mark by going big, but maybe they should have opted to move in the opposite direction.
  <em>
   Mini Royale
  </em>
  drops 50 toy soldiers into a child's messy room and challenges them to survive. While the gameplay does not seem too far removed from the status quo, Indigoblue's game stands out due to its whimsical premise and charming map, at least going by the one that has been shown off so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  If done right,
  <em>
   Mini Royale
  </em>
  could come as a breath of fresh air in a somewhat stagnant genre. The premise should pave the way for a unique range of weapons and items that go beyond the traditional armories found in most battle royales. Beyond that, the developer has confirmed that the map will have small touches that take advantage of the core concept, including a toy train as a means of travel.

  Blending PvP and enemy fights,
  <em>
   Dungeon Stalkers
  </em>
  looks set to be an ambitious blend of multiplayer and classic single-player tropes. Action Square's game bills itself as a PvEvP dungeon crawler, which is unique since so many of these types of releases tend to be extraction shooters. While ranged weaponry appears to be part of the equation, the available footage suggests that the main focus is on melee combat, and the game will feature multiple playable characters (naturally, the eponymous "Stalkers").
 </p>
 <p>
  At the moment,
  <em>
   Dungeon Stalkers
  </em>
  ' quality is difficult to predict. The trailers and screenshots suggest potential, although they do indicate that the release could be a bit rough around the edges. Going by the description on Steam, the game is essentially an extraction RPG, with players entering dungeons to kill monsters and acquire loot as long as they make it out alive.

  Launching a beta period in May 2024,
  <em>
   Arena Breakout: Infinite
  </em>
  has been gathering momentum in recent months, hopefully paving the way for a successful early access project. An extraction shooter that shares similarities with projects like
  <em>
   Escape from Tarkov
  </em>
  , the game aims for realism in its presentation, weapon customization, and gun feedback, which tends to be the case with these sorts of titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beta version shows promise, particularly in its visuals, quality-of-life ideas, and weapon options; however, the game is fairly rough around the edges in places and does not seem to contain too many new ideas. However, betas are specifically designed to promote player feedback, so
  <em>
   Arena Breakout
  </em>
  could and should improve in the coming months.

  While Ubisoft canceled
  <em>
   Heartland
  </em>
  , a free-to-play
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  game that was fairly hyped up for a while, the publisher seems set to release a mobile game set in the same universe.
  <em>
   Resurgence
  </em>
  looks to adapt the franchise's MMO structure for Android and iOS devices, delivering similar third-person shooter gunplay, missions, exploration, and loot. Returning to New York, the setting for the first game in the series, the
  <strong>
   upcoming free game
  </strong>
  will also feature an open-world that supports both PvE and PvP content, with the latter coming courtesy of the Dark Zone. The former will include a brand-new campaign and storyline that focuses on the early days of the virus' spread, casting players as early members of the Strategic Homeland Division.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going on the beta footage released so far,
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's The Division: Resurgence
  </em>
  looks pretty promising, especially for a mobile device. While the pre-release gameplay shows some stutter, that could be ironed out by the time the final product launches; even then, the game still looks good in its current state.
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  has kind of a weird reputation. Despite not being as talked about as some other live-service projects like
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , the franchise has been largely successful, and
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  is still quite active.

  1047 Games'
  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  was and still is a fun multiplayer shooter that sets itself apart from the crowd by utilizing portals (or wormholes) as a means to get around maps quickly, along with helping combat. While not one of the biggest free options on the market, the original game has a small but dedicated fanbase that has kept it alive since its 2022 official release. Still, the announcement of a sequel came somewhat out of nowhere, especially since an Alpha went live fairly quickly (on August 21, 2024, to be exact).
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if not a lot of people had
  <em>
   Splitgate 2
  </em>
  on their bingo card for 2025, the sequel is still a fairly exciting prospect since this concept has plenty of room to grow. Assuming it hits the ground running, this project could be a worthwhile addition to many players' game cycle, particularly if they enjoy high-octane PvP shooters with a cool sci-fi twist. While the core gameplay loop should remain fairly similar to the original game,
  <em>
   Splitgate 2
  </em>
  looks set to incorporate several exciting evolutions, along with a switch to Unreal Engine 5.

  Love or hate it, AI is here to stay and will almost certainly become a major part of video game design moving forward.
  <em>
   Paradise
  </em>
  seems set to take advantage of this technology, using it to create an open-world where NPCs are more than just no-name figures with no identity beyond their set cycle. The idea is that AI will enable players to interact with NPCs in far greater detail than usual, with the latter having full lives that are automatically generated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The concept is ambitious and could pave the way to more realistic worlds than ever before, ones that could (potentially) offer endless possibilities. Beyond this selling point,
  <em>
   Paradise
  </em>
  does not appear to have much of a story, at least not one that is being highlighted at the moment. Perhaps, the developers are primarily seeking to create a slice of life-type experience where players can just go about their day, enjoying unique activities as they mess about in the world.

  Hotta Studio's
  <em>
   Neverness To Everness
  </em>
  has been quietly attracting hype, garnering interest due to its seemingly ambitious combination of action JRPG combat and a
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  -style open-world. It also includes gacha mechanics, which seem to be a requirement for these types of releases in this day and age. Honestly, on paper,
  <em>
   Neverness To Everness
  </em>
  seems almost too good to be true, especially since the developer is fairly unknown; that said, Hotta released a 13-minute gameplay showcase video that does a pretty good job of highlighting the game's world and combat. If nothing else, this free RPG at least appears to genuinely exist and seems to be developing nicely.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Neverness To Everness
  </em>
  is slated to debut on mobile devices, PC, and PS5, which is quite a diverse platform slate. Nowadays, iOS and Android devices are capable of running AAA-level games, even ones that are being created in Unreal Engine 5. Obviously, it is still way too early to predict whether this project will be a success or not, but the early signs are positive enough to warrant keeping an eye on
  <em>
   Neverness To Everness
  </em>
  . It would be cool to have another great free action JRPG that is not developed by MiHoYo.

  Debuting in 2019 on mobile devices,
  <em>
   Arknights
  </em>
  is nowadays well established as one of the industry's most famous projects. It was even successful enough to warrant an anime adaptation, and the franchise looks set to continue its expansion with a spin-off game set on a new planet. Endfield Industries has taken measures to bring civilization to Talos-II, but the world and its locals have been less than welcoming. Set following a disaster that greatly hurt this movement, players step into the shoes of PFRD operatives tasked with taming the alien planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Arknights: Endfield
  </em>
  looks set to be fairly different from the mainline entry. For one, the spin-off will utilize real-time strategy combat, although exact details on the system's mechanics have yet to be provided. It is also unclear whether the game will employ gacha mechanics, although that seems likely. More importantly,
  <em>
   Endfield
  </em>
  will be available on PC, an ecosystem that
  <em>
   Arknights
  </em>
  has yet to target specifically.

  An Eastern MMORPG that completed an Exploratory Closed Beta Test in June 2023,
  <em>
   Perfect New World
  </em>
  has a ways to go before reaching completion, but Ironcore is working on implementing a wide range of changes inspired by user feedback. Cast as Soul Tamers, players will strive to find Prime, a journey that involves exploring a seemingly fairly attractive fantasy world filled with dungeons, enemies, and NPCs. Obviously, the MMORPG will support co-op/multiplayer, and PvP is also part of the overall experience and is being tweaked following the closed beta.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Perfect New World
  </em>
  's combat system seems to lean into real-time hack and slash territory, with fast-paced action being the name of the game. As with most MMORPGs, players will be able to pick from a range of classes that come with their own skill trees. Although there is nothing too unique about these ideas, they could combine to create a fun addition to the free-to-play market.

  Dani has two successful free games under their belt:
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Crab Game
  </em>
  . Both titles focus on physics-based gameplay, and they are fairly impressive considering they largely stemmed from the mind of a single person. Dani's next project is
  <em>
   Karlson
  </em>
  , a first-person shooter that heavily incorporates parkour and speed-running. The eponymous character is a prisoner who must wall-jump and blast their way through a series of levels en route to a glass of milk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creator's resume and social media presence ensure
  <em>
   Karlson
  </em>
  would get some attention, but the game also presents a convincing case for meriting this hype. A version of the project can be downloaded for free on Itch.io, and it is quite good.

  After roughly a year of rumors and undisclosed playtests, Valve finally acknowledged that
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is a thing in August 2024. Despite having a Steam page and featuring a respectable active player count, the game is not currently available to try, with the only people playing are ones with special invitations. Furthermore, Valve has been very tight-lipped about the project, only revealing the bare minimum. Still, the available knowledge paints an exciting picture of a game that looks set to combine two popular
  <strong>
   free
  </strong>
  genres: MOBAs and hero shooters. The latter is fairly oversaturated nowadays and there is not much of a call for new representatives, but Valve certainly has the reputation and resources to craft an exception.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Valve has not revealed that
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  will be free-to-play, so this mention is based purely on market and historical evidence. Except for
  <em>
   Half-Life: Alyx
  </em>
  , Valve seems to have mostly focused on free games over the last decade, at least whenever the developer decides to create something new. More importantly, Valve's multiplayer projects tend not to be buy-to-play, and there is no reason the publisher should change course and try something different at this point. Also,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's swift termination might not encourage many publishers to go down the premium hero shooter route.

  <em>

  players would surely benefit from, especially those who have tons of cards in their decks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite positive reception and massive success,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is still not yet the finished article, and the community is helping by sharing its feedback with the game's developer. Just recently,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  players shared their dissatisfaction with premium mission rewards, pointing out that the paid offerings could be a little better. Fortunately, developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA have seemed receptive to this kind of feedback so far, so hopefully the studios continue to implement community ideas.
 </p>
 <p>
  A thread started by Redditor AtlasGrey_ has called for the addition of a quality-of-life feature that would allow players to rearrange their
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  decks. Their own reason for this is that they like to sort their decks by the color of the cards, although there are plenty more scenarios where this could be useful for other players. One user had a solution for this, pointing out that they can delete their decks and remake them in the order they want. While this technically is a one-time fix, it would become tedious doing this every single time they want to rearrange their decks.

  Other users in the thread were quick to jump on the train, pointing out the quality-of-life features
  <em>

  needs. Ideas included the possibility of building more than 15 decks, as well as favoriting a deck and actually putting it at the top of the deck list. One fan went as far as to describe the game as "a good example of good UI, bad UX." Whether any of these ideas get implemented into
  <em>

  in the future remains to be seen.

  <em>
   Ys V: Lost Kefin, Kingdom of Sand
  </em>
  stands out as one of the most distinctive entries in the
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  saga. Released for the Super Nintendo in 1995, the title remains somewhat out of reach for many in the West due to the absence of an official English version. As a result, the only way to experience Adol’s quest is through fan translations of the original edition.
 </p>
 <p>
  It offers gameplay that can be challenging for newcomers, but despite that, it delivers an entertaining adventure well worth playing. Those new to the series may want to start elsewhere, but for longtime followers, it's a fascinating choice.

  <em>
   Ys: Memories of Celceta
  </em>
  was originally published on PlayStation Vita, followed by later versions in a Kai format that brought improved quality-of-life features. It is viewed as an excellent gateway for those new to the
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  saga, built around a straightforward premise in which Adol Christin has lost his memories while investigating the region of Celceta.
 </p>
 <p>
  As he uncovers more about his past and the surrounding world, the game works as a superb introduction for those unfamiliar with the series. With accessible gameplay and concepts that would later be refined in
  <em>
   Lacrimosa of Dana
  </em>
  -one of the most praised installments -
  <em>
   Memories of Celceta
  </em>
  holds a special place in the
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  lineup.

  <em>
   Ys IX: Monstrum Nox
  </em>
  was released in 2019 for PlayStation 4 in Japan and later reached Western audiences in 2021. The game takes place in the prison city of Balduq, where Adol Christin is transformed into a Monstru - a being with supernatural powers tasked with fighting creatures from another dimension.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monstrum Nox
  </em>
  introduced several innovations to the series, including unique traversal abilities
  <em>
   tied to each Monstrum's powers
  </em>
  , allowing players to explore the city in new and dynamic ways. With its darker tone and expanded focus on world exploration, it represents a bold evolution for the franchise.

  <em>
   Ys X: Nordics
  </em>
  is the latest entry in the franchise, carrying forward the lessons and evolutions accumulated over the decades. Although it is a recent release, the game is set chronologically after the events of
  <em>
   Ys II
  </em>
  and features a young Adol Christin journeying toward the region of Celceta.
 </p>
 <p>
  The title introduces several improvements in gameplay, including the Cross Action system, which allows for the simultaneous control of both Adol and Karja. Additionally, the game incorporates elements reminiscent of
  <em>
   Lacrimosa of Dana
  </em>
  , with a design that leans toward a metroidvania-style exploration, appealing to both long-time fans and newcomers eager to delve into the series.

  <em>
   Ys Seven

  is regarded as one of the best titles in the series, with many fans highlighting its exceptional gameplay. Released in 2009, the title was widely praised for its variety of abilities and combat system, elements that became staples in subsequent entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  In earlier titles, players had to switch between elemental weapons to deal damage to monsters and bosses. While the basic concept remains the same,
  <em>
   Ys Seven
  </em>
  introduced the ability for players to alternate between party members and use different attacks, adding a layer of strategy and variety that enhanced the gameplay experience.

  The best way to start exploring the
  <em>
   Ys series
  </em>
  is by playing
  <em>
   Ys Origin
  </em>
  . Set 700 years before the events of
  <em>
   Ys I
  </em>
  , this title serves as an introduction to the franchise while retaining many of the modern mechanics that have become staples of the series and are widely praised to this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   Ys Origin
  </em>
  keeps elements from the classic games, such as boss battle design, which is reminiscent of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  style, where players must figure out how the mechanics work to progress. Unlike other entries in the series, Adol Christin is not the protagonist here, and the story focuses on new characters, making it an excellent entry point for newcomers.

 <p>
  Widely regarded as one of the best action JRPGs in existence, this chapter shines through its fluid combat system, which grows increasingly engaging as players advance. So,
  <em>
   Ys 8: Lacrimosa Of Dana
  </em>
  , stands out for its fluid combat, one of the most refined in the series, and its layers of complexity that make the gameplay increasingly engaging.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story takes place on an island after the ship
  <em>
   Lombardia
  </em>
  sinks, with Adol Christin waking up in a deserted region. The plot revolves around exploring the island, meeting other survivors from the ship, and battling local creatures, as players strive to survive and help the Castaway Village - an outpost founded by the ship’s crew - thrive.

      <title>What to Expect From Haunted Chocolatier in 2025</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/haunted-chocolatier-news-2025-trailers-gameplay/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's next new game, anticipation has been building year-on-year for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Haunted Chocolatier
   </strong>
  </em>
  since it was announced in 2021, meaning expectations could get even higher in 2025. With Barone's first game,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , joining the ranks of legendary indie hits like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  , it was no surprise that the developer's next game getting announced would capture the gaming community's attention. Yet with only one trailer and a handful of official details revealed via Barone's blog or social media, fans are left waiting to learn something more substantial about
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Fans would be wise to manage their expectations regarding news about
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier,
  </em>
  given that ConcernedApe continues to work on
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , as indicated by its large-scale 1.6 update. Given that Barone is still currently a solo developer, this could mean the future of
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  will remain just as unclear in 2025 as it was in 2024 if it has to compete with
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . With this in mind, the best hope players might have for 2025 is for Barone to confirm new
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  details, if only to reassure players who have been left waiting.

 <p>
  Based on everything revealed about
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  so far, either by a trailer or by Barone himself, while the game may share the same visual design and in-game universe, the upcoming game could be a significant departure from
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . For instance, in addition to an all-new setting and a range of new characters,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  seems more supernaturally inspired than
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , such as focusing on the game's ghosts as part of the player's chocolate-making business. In line with this, although
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  will remain within the sim genre, it will depart from the niche of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's farm sim.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another fundamental change from
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  will be
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's emphasis on combat and a darker atmosphere, with the game's trailer revealing examples of the upcoming game's enemies and bosses. From the revealed gameplay,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  appears to be a single-player game with a stronger focus on the mystery surrounding its setting and characters. Since it's not clear if the two games share a world, it's hard to say if fans can expect returning
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  characters like Grampa. Though details may be subject to change over the next year,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  is at least promising a different and even more mature experience to the likes of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .

  However, given that comparisons between Barone's first and next game are highly likely,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  has only been able to give players a small insight into the upcoming game, such as revealing new gameplay mechanics, locations, or characters. In order to put distance between it and
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's release strategy could try and be more proactive during 2025, both to reassure players awaiting its release and to reaffirm its own identity. Though an official release date is unlikely to be confirmed in 2025, Barone could switch things up from 2024 and reveal more about
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  instead of focusing on
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  as hinted at on social media.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, while
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  is ideally still in development, despite Barone's comments about the game "getting dusty on the shelf" in a recent blog post, this shouldn't stop the developer from sharing existing gameplay, concepts, and more. This could include information about previously seen characters from
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's trailer, such as Burk, Maddie, and Jett, or Barone could reveal other bosses aside from the boss fight from the same trailer. Ultimately, however, with Barone continuing to update
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , expectations for news about
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  should be managed during 2025.

  The new iteration of the
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  everyone knew and loved was a blast to experience, with Kratos trying to be a good father while doing justice to Faye's legacy. His loving Giant wife gave him a valuable gift in the form of the Leviathan Axe, which is a frost-imbued weapon that hits for serious damage.

 <p>
  This weapon takes a while to get used to but becomes an enduring facet of Kratos' arsenal in no time. It cleaves enemies with ease and freezes them to hit for major damage, with the functionality of this weapon further enhanced in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ragnarok
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Players love using this weapon along with the Blades of Chaos, causing devastating damage and leaving enemies floundering to survive in no time.

  The Gravity Gun was pretty much a flex from Valve who wanted to show just how ahead of its time
  <strong>
   <em>
    Half-Life 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was when this amazing FPS launched. The physics present in this title was amazing to behold and still blows many minds to this day. To make sure that players realized just how amazing this system was, they were allowed to toy around with a weapon that let them manipulate objects in the environment for both combat and puzzles.

 <p>
  With an iconic design coupled with some fun gameplay implementations, it's easy to see why the Gravity Gun made such a strong impression in the minds of most fans. Even after all the innovations that have happened in the gaming industry since then, the sheer joy players experience while using this iconic weapon is unmatched.

  This nuclear device is a treat for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout
   </strong>
  </em>
  fans who love what this series brings to the table. Ever since the first entry, the ludicrous nature of the post-apocalypse coupled with a gritty aesthetic is a huge reason why players love this franchise to bits. With the

  </em>
  TV adaptation making waves, it's easy to see why interest in this IP is higher than ever before.

  When players get their hands on the iconic Fat Man, they have no idea what's in store for them. This weapon uses the rare mini-nuke ammunition to unleash small atomic blasts that obliterate everything in sight, including the player if they happen to be within the general radius of said explosion. It's a ridiculous weapon that has become iconic in the eyes of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans, and for good reason.

  Sora's Kingdom Key, the most recognized Keyblade, was the first to appear in the series and intricately linked to his character. Beyond its combat functionality, the weapon's role in unlocking and locking the Keyholes of different worlds adds depth to the game's narrative and gameplay mechanics. This ability allows Sora and his friends to access new worlds while preventing the heartless from gaining access to the heart of those worlds.

  The weapon is a fusion of Disney's lightheartedness and Square Enix's extravagant style, showcasing the perfect blend of elements that define the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. It serves as an effective melee weapon and a tool for unlocking worlds but also channels magic, making it a jack of all trades and master of everything it does. Its unique and absurd appearance perfectly encapsulates the whimsical and imaginative nature of the game itself. Despite its seemingly ridiculous concept, the Keyblade works flawlessly in execution, making it a beloved and popular video game weapon.

  The Mega Buster is an iconic and versatile weapon in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mega Man
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. It has been a part of Mega Man's left hand since the first game and has evolved in power over time. Originally only capable of shooting tiny pellets, it later became the Super Mega Buster, allowing for charged shots and increased firepower. The Mega Buster serves as a base shell for modification, enabling Mega Man to acquire and utilize various weapon types from defeated robot masters. This evolution from a humble, lemon-shooting sentient to an almighty arsenal-wielding robot overlord is crucial to the gameplay experience.

 <p>
  The Mega Buster's ability to expand in power with items like the metal blade or fire wave makes it an unstoppable killing machine capable of attacking enemies in multiple directions. This versatility provides for tactical platforming, setting the
  <em>
   Mega Ma
  </em>
  n series apart from other games. The Mega Buster's significance lies in its central role as the foundation of Mega Man's weaponry and the diverse gameplay experiences it enables. As a result, it has earned its place as one of the greatest video game weapons of all time.

  The Soul Edge is an iconic weapon in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soulcalibur
   </em>
  </strong>
  series, known as "The Evil Sword," and a driving force behind the entire franchise. Possessing seemingly unlimited power, the blade gains strength by consuming the souls of the fallen. Among the many who have wielded it, Nightmare, the Azure Knight, stands out as the most prominent user, with the sword taking the form of a giant blade with a menacing eyeball.

 <p>
  The weapon's malevolence is so profound that even its spirit, Inferno, becomes a separate entity, seeking to destroy Soul Calibur and the world. The Soul Edge's dark and powerful presence has made it an enduring symbol of evil within the series and an Iconic weapon in the video game industry.

  The Buster Sword is easily the most iconic weapon in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , a series known for having over-the-top weapons. Cloud Strife wields this blade after being given the same by Zack Fair in an emotional scene that is expanded upon in
  <em>
   Crisis Core
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  This weapon is further enhanced in
  <em>
   Advent Children
  </em>
  , where the blade splits apart into smaller swords. This makes the final Omnislash against Sephiroth look even more dazzling and further cements the Buster Sword's legacy as one of the greatest video game blades of all time.

  The Vampire Killer whip, an iconic weapon in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castlevania
   </strong>
  </em>
  series, is the heirloom of the Belmont clan, bestowed with power and destiny to smite the incarnation of evil, Dracula. Despite being overshadowed by other weapons in the series' evolution, it remains an essential symbol of the heroic legacy of the Belmonts. Super
  <em>
   Castlevania IV
  </em>
  enhanced its appeal with versatile attacks in eight directions, adding to the fun of wielding it.

 <p>
  Despite the challenging platformer gameplay, mastering the whip with precision and skill brings immense satisfaction. As players traverse the castle, the Vampire Killer becomes a timeless representation of the struggle between good and evil in the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  series.

  There's no denying that Squall's Gunblade is an impractical weapon, but players who love this game don't care. Striking a critical hit by pressing the trigger button at the right time never ceases to be satisfying as Squall slices and shoots the enemy at the same time.

 <p>
  Players unlock bigger and better weapons as the game progresses, but nothing comes close to the ludicrousness of Squall's base weapon. It's a testament to the brilliance of the designers to make sure that every

  game looks and feels unique.

  It's often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, in which case, the developers of
  <em>
   Death Ball
  </em>
  must really like
  <em>
   Blade Ball
  </em>
  . The two games are incredibly similar, although many
  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox
   </strong>
  </em>
  players now seem to prefer the former, finding its gameplay to be a lot more exciting than what's on offer in the original.

 <p>
  As is the case in
  <em>
   Blade Ball
  </em>
  , there are plenty of
  <em>
   Death Ball
  </em>
  codes that players can redeem for free Gems and other great rewards.
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players should be sure to redeem these codes as soon as possible though, as the game is updated often, which can lead to codes expiring at a moment's notice.

    Updated June 8, 2024, by Tom Bowen:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   As a result of the game's lead dev working hard on another project (Anime Defenders), Death Ball hasn't received any meaningful new content as of late. Unfortunately, this extends to Death Ball codes, with none having been released since the beginning of the year. Thankfully, however, there are still two working codes for Death Ball, which new players can redeem to get their hands on 8,000 free Gems. Players who've already redeemed codes jiro and xmas should be sure to check back here soon, as we'll continue to search for new Death Ball codes and will update this guide as soon as we find some.

  The process for redeeming
  <em>
   Death Ball
  </em>
  codes is relatively straightforward and not too dissimilar from redeeming codes in other
  <em>

  Where to Find More Death Ball Codes
 </h2>
 <p>
  Players can find new codes for
  <em>
   Death Ball
  </em>
  in a few different places. For starters, it's a good idea to join the game's official Discord server, both for new codes and information about the game. Players should also follow Sub on Twitter, as they sometimes tweet about the game. However, the best place to find new
  <em>
   Death Ball
  </em>
  codes is arguably right here, as this guide will be updated regularly as and when new codes become available. As such, it's a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here often so as to avoid missing out on future freebies.

  There are plenty of great
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  games that are inspired by manga and anime, but few, if any, are quite as good as
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  . As its name suggests, it's based on Tite Kubo's
  <em>
   Bleach
  </em>
  and offers players an incredibly enjoyable combat experience that Ichigo himself would be proud of. As in most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, that experience can become even better with the help of
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

  Players can redeem
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes to claim a ridiculous amount of free Product Essences, which they can then take to Kisuke in The City to get rerolls on every individual path. Product Essences can also be used to acquire cosmetic items, which is why fans of the game are always on the lookout for all of the latest
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

  </strong>
  <em>
   New Peroxide codes used to be added to the game all the time. Sadly, however, that's no longer the case. It's been weeks now since the last new code, much to the dismay of many players. Thankfully, there are still plenty of working codes for Peroxide, meaning that new players can get a pretty decent amount of Product Essences right from the get-go. After redeeming these codes, it's a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here often, as we'll be adding new Peroxide codes to the list below as soon as we find them.

  As with similar

  games, the process of redeeming codes in

 <ul>
  <li>
   First, it is necessary to launch
   <em>
    Peroxide
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Then, if players are entering the game for the first time, they'll need to go through the tutorial.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once the tutorial has been completed, in the upper left part of the screen, players should find and select the start button. It is located to the right of the chat button.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the resulting menu, players should type or paste any of the active
   <em>
    Peroxide
   </em>
   codes listed above and then press Enter.
  </li>
 </ul>

  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  (formerly
  <em>
   Demon Piece
  </em>
  ) is another
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game inspired by the popular anime
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  . Compared to most of the others though, it is much better designed and more enjoyable. In this RPG adventure, your goal is to become the best among other players, and the path to the objective is very difficult and thorny.

  Hundreds of enemies and bosses will stand in your way, and if you are not well-leveled, it is unlikely that you can confront them. However, by redeeming
  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  codes, you can provide yourself with a decent amount of currency and boosters that will help you progress through the game much faster.

   <em>
    Updated June 8, 2024, by Tom Bowen:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   New Fruit Seas codes have been a little hard to come by lately, despite the game hitting the most recent likes goal set by the lead dev. With Update 2 now looming large on the horizon, though, one suspects that some new codes will be added fairly soon. Players should be sure to check back here often so as to avoid missing out once they are, as many of the redeem codes for Fruit Seas expire after just a couple of days. In the meantime, there are still some working Fruit Seas codes that new players can enjoy.

  Redeeming
  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  codes is not a difficult process. Fortunately, there are no restrictions or tutorials in the game, so you'll have access to this option as soon as you launch the title. So, if you're a beginner and have never redeemed codes in a
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game before, or if you just forgot how to do it, below is a detailed guide:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Fruit Seas
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the left side of the screen. There will be a white button with black dashes on the icon above your HP and stamina, and you should click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   After doing so, you will open a side menu with several more buttons. Among them, find and interact with the settings button with a gear on the icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the settings menu, in the lower section, you will see an input field. Here you need to enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the active codes listed above.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you've done that, press Enter to submit your reward request. If you have done everything correctly, REDEEMED! will be highlighted in green in the input field, and the rewards will be added to your inventory or balance.

  There are plenty of great
  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox
   </strong>
  </em>
  games inspired by
  <em>
   Jujutsu Kaisen
  </em>
  , but few have made quite as big an impression as
  <em>
   Jujutsu Shenanigans
  </em>
  . Featuring several
  <em>
   JJK
  </em>
  characters and a plethora of powers and abilities from the anime, this combat-focused battlegrounds game has taken the community by storm and continues to grow at an impressive pace.

  Given the game's immense and ever-growing popularity, it should come as no surprise to learn that there is also a huge demand for
  <em>
   Jujutsu Shenanigans
  </em>
  codes.
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players can redeem codes for
  <em>
   Jujutsu Shenanigans
  </em>
  by visiting the Rewards section of the shop menu, though before they can do that, they'll first need to find them, which they can do just by scrolling down the page.

  <em>
   Despite the game being played by hundreds of thousands of people every week, new Jujutsu Shenanigans codes are incredibly hard to come by, making them a whole lot more meaningful when they do eventually show up. Sadly, there hasn't been a new one for quite some time now, but with the game fast approaching a quarter of a billion visits, there's a pretty good chance of that changing fairly soon. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here from time to time, as we'll be sure to add new codes for Jujutsu Shenanigans whenever we find them.

  Redeeming codes in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Shenanigans
  </em>
  is fairly straightforward when compared to some other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games. Players will simply need to press a few buttons and then type or paste in the code that they want to use. Most should be able to figure it all out for themselves, but for those having trouble, the following step-by-step instructions should help:

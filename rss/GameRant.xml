  The Dorms map in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ready or Not's
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   Home Invasion
  </em>
  DLC offers a unique challenge — it has both close and long-ranged sightlines, and there are plenty of sneaky angles where players can get shot from. It's a tricky level to complete, but with enough patience and know-how, players will be able to get a perfect rating for it nonetheless.

  While this mission is definitely one of the harder ones in
  <em>
   Ready or Not
  </em>
  , completing it with a high rating is far from impossible. The following guide covers all the important bits of the Dorms map, including all soft and hard objectives as well as some general tips on how to make your run a little bit easier.

  The Dorms map is similar to
  <em>
   RoN's

  Twisted Nerve mission in a lot of ways. Both levels are set in a rundown building full of junkies, and drugs are involved one way or another.

  As far as objectives go, Dorms resembles your typical police raid — go in, control the situation, pacify all threats, and secure all civilians. However, the objectives aren't the problem, it's the map layout.

 <p>
  The building is
  <strong>
   full of dark areas and wall holes
  </strong>
  that armed suspects can hide and fire from. All those little murder holes in the walls in particular can be a huge problem, since they diminish the effectiveness of tactical grenades. For this mission,
  <strong>
   we recommend bringing a shield and/or CS gas
  </strong>
  — have your pointman block incoming bullets, and if there are any armed suspects in a room, chuck some tear gas inside. Gas should bypass broken walls and affect anyone hiding behind them.

  Thankfully, there's only one soft objective in Dorms, and that's to
  <strong>
   secure some drug equipment
  </strong>
  somewhere in the building. To find it, start at the south entrance, then head up the first set of stairs in the long hallway. You should be able to see a shrine of sorts after a short search. Head to the lectern to find a bong along with packets of drugs.

   <strong>
    Wear heavy armor

  <li>
   <strong>
    Bring flashlights
   </strong>
   . This map isn't dark enough for night vision, but dim enough to obscure your vision.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Go for non-lethal hits
   </strong>
   . If you aren't using a beanbag shotgun or pepperball launcher, aim for the shoulders or stomach. Remember: you must arrest five suspects.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Use hollow-point ammo
   </strong>
   . Suspects here are mostly unarmored and are easily stopped by HP ammo. Might lead to a higher fatality rate, though.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Bring tasers and pepper spray
   </strong>
   . The majority of civilians and suspects here are non-compliant.

  In a surprise announcement, Marvel and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout
   </em>
  </strong>
  debuted a trailer showcasing a new crossover with
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  . The zany party title has a long-running reputation for collaborating with high-profile properties as characters of all shapes and sizes are transformed into the game's iconic beans. Initially announced at E3 2019 and later released on August 4, 2020,
  <em>
   Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout
  </em>
  was an immediate hit with players of all ages.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  was originally released by Tonic Games Group, but the company was acquired by Epic Games in 2021. Since then, the title has been pulled into more and more collaborations with other games, like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , developed by Epic. In fact, there was a period of time in September 2024 when
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players could play
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  in a battle royale match. In February 2024, Disney bought a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games with the intent of introducing larger crossovers that include Marvel, Disney, Pixar,
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  , and more.

  <em>

  will now be able to run around as Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. The iconic Guardians appear to be modeled after their movie variants instead of their traditional comic book outfits.

  <em>
   Fall Guys

  has collaborated with Marvel

  and it likely won't be the last. Earlier in 2024, Spider-Man fans were treated to a crossover with Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and Gwen Stacy in their iconic outfits. Collaborations like these have become more and more frequent as the relationship between Epic Games and Disney deepens.

  Epic Games and Disney appear to have a strategy when it comes to collaboration within their most popular titles. The companies have been able to combine their efforts to great effect by bringing massive properties under the same umbrella for the first time. The fact that gamers can run around as characters from both
  <em>
   Encanto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Avengers
  </em>
  is a feat few other games could hope to accomplish. In addition to popular crossovers, the developer has ensured that titles like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  feature full crossplay and cross-progression. All of these features feel like wins for both the company and the consumer.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  website has confirmed that developers are investigating a problem with the spin wheel. The
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  spin wheel is a mini-game that allows players to earn more rewards, but some players have spotted an issue with it.

  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  was released in 2023, and it has earned over $3 billion since then, with developer Scopely continuing to update the game. Since it was released, the game has raised the bar for Scopely, w/hich has developed games like
  <em>
   Stumble Guys
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   WWE Champions
  </em>
  , and more. With this success,
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  regularly runs events like Amazing Partners, Stealthy Soar, and Railroad Rush that incentivize players to return. Beyond the regular in-game offerings, some players can join the Tycoon Club, which offers many benefits. Some gamers have discovered that Wheel Spins, which are offered in various ways, are acting strangely and Scopely is looking for a resolution.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  website has an alert message detailing a spinning issue that has been highlighted by many community members. According to the website, Scopely is aware of issues with the
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  Amazing Partners event wheel spins, and it's working on a fix. Players have experienced an issue in which the spin wheel slows down nearly to a stop before speeding up suddenly. This may result in some gamers thinking that they were meant to get one reward before the wheel continues to spin and gives them a different one. Some rewards that players can unlock from a wheel spin include free dice rolls, cash, sticker packs, and more. The developer has apologized for the inconvenience, but according to some players, its customer service department isn't offering compensation for players who have encountered the issue.

  For players to unlock
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  spins, they must complete a Color Set which requires that they collect and upgrade every property that matches. There are also Special Events like the current Amazing Partners one and Wheel Boost that allow players to gain more spins. The
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  Tycoon Club also offers a daily wheel spin as part of its incentive for players to join. This wheel spin issue seems to be related to its animation as the rewards for these randomizers are often decided when a gamer activates the mini-game. As the game has offered freebies in the past, this issue affecting some players could result in Scopely sending the community free items for compensation.

 <p>
  As Scopely continues to update
  <em>

  , and it confirmed that it's working on the wheel spin, the problem could be resolved soon. Because the wheel spin worked differently in the past, an unrelated code change on the back end could've caused the issue.

 <p>
  In its mid-Season 13 content update,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  added new Energy Javelins to all of Orisa’s old Legendary skins from the original game. Players who have any of these near-dozen Orisa skins in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  can enjoy these matching Energy Javelins in game right now.

 <p>
  On November 12,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  rolled out its mid-Season 13 content update. This new patch implemented some balance adjustments for a dozen heroes, but also marked the start of Overwatch: Classic – a limited-time game mode that takes the FPS back to where it all began in 2016.

 <p>
  However, it seems this content update added a special detail to Orisa that wasn’t mentioned anywhere in the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  mid-Season 13 patch notes. As of this update, 11 old Legendary Orisa skins from
  <em>
   Overwatch 1
  </em>
  now have matching Energy Javelin skins. These skins previously used the default green javelin, but now, each of them has a unique appearance that matches their respective Legendary skins.

 <p>
  Because the Energy Javelin used in the eponymous skill and Javelin Spin are both new to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , skins implemented before the sequel never received custom textures. Legendary and Mythic skins released in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , such as GR-IFFON, Star Sheep, and Grand Beast Orisa, had special Energy Javelins – and now, every Orisa skin of Legendary or higher quality has one. Unfortunately, this does not include most Epic skins, which still use the normal Energy Javelin, save Carved Orisa and a few of her competitive recolors.

  Hilariously, Forest Spirit Orisa briefly had a custom Energy Javelin in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  before it was removed. That said, the in-game model was unfinished, lacking the textures of the new, completed version the skin has now. According to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  concept artist CitricWitch, these Energy Javelins were a pet project of theirs, so this unfinished version was probably one of the first in-progress models for the Orisa Energy Javelin skins.

  Needless to say, Orisa fans were delighted to discover these incredible new Energy Javelin skins in the game. They applauded CitricWitch for their hard work, complimenting the accuracy of the 3D models compared to their initial designs. The lack of unique Energy Javelins had been a pain point for many Orisa players, as the bright green default weapon clashed significantly with some of her more unique skins. Though it took
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  two years to finally implement them, Orisa fans can rest easy knowing their favorite Legendary skins will have Energy Javelins that match from now on.

  Once someone's HP reaches zero in
  <em>
   <strong>

   </strong>
  </em>
  , they will be killed. When killed in combat, that party member will stay dead even after you finish the battle and return to the overworld, as death isn't naturally undone.

  Especially during the early sections of the game, the death of a party member will usually spell the end of an adventure, with your new goal to bring that party member back to life. XP is not shared with the dead, and fighting one party member down is already reason enough to quite progress to another difficult fight. For those dark times when a party member does die; here's how to revive them.

 <p>
  For the most part, the best way to bring someone back from the dead is through
  <strong>
   resurrection at a nearby church
  </strong>
  , so it's best to always have Chimera wings to fast travel back to a town anytime. Churches are made with the trident-like icon on the map, and while they are sometimes a building, some smaller cities will just have a Priest or Priestess on the side of the road who can still perform all the same duties.

  At the church or priest, the third option from the top will be Resurrection. Resurrection from the church has a
  <strong>
   100% chance of working
  </strong>
  , though it will cost a fair price depending on who is being resurrected. The factors that affect the price are:

 <p>
  While church prices will continue to increase in regards to Resurrection, players can do it themselves with the spell Zing.
  <strong>
   Priests learn the spell Zing at level 10
  </strong>
  , and this spell only has a chance of bringing back a dead party member. There is a stronger version of this skill that is learned later on and has a 100% chance at resurrection, through early on in the game you'll have to choose between the church or trying to cast Zing a few times.

 <p>
  If you have a Priest who can cast Zing, you can use a nearby Inn to greatly cut the cost of Resurrection. Simply cast Zing as many times as needed and
  <strong>
   rest at the Inn the restore the Priest and parties' MP back to full
  </strong>
  , making the total cost of Resurrection only be a dozen gold or so at most depending on the town you are in.

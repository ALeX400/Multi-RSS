  As
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues to grow with new content, so too does its playerbase. While
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  may have had a downward trend a couple of years ago, the Worldsoul Saga is seemingly righting the ship and once more cementing
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  as the king of the MMO genre. However, even with the massive improvements Blizzard has been steadily introducing, there is still one hurdle that faces new players: the game's unfriendly and dated UI.

 <p>
  For years,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  players have been complaining about the game's UI. Oftentimes, players have found it to be unintuitive and ugly looking. Even with the improvements that came with Dragonflight, there still seems to be a need for UI add-ons to make the experience far more approachable. If Blizzard wants to continue to attract new players to its expansive world, then it needs to tackle this issue head-on.

  WoW's Base UI Can Be Aggravating at Times
 </h3>
 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's inception back in 2004, the game has mostly stuck with the same exact UI. Blizzard has changed a couple of things over the years, but instead of overhauling the experience, it has just made the entire thing more cluttered. Players have little control over its layout, things are buried in multiple menus, and it often takes players a decent amount of time to find what they are looking for. As a result, many veteran players have turned to UI add-ons to fix these issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the release of Dragonflight, Blizzard finally overhauled
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  's base UI. This was the first major overhaul in 18 years, finally giving the UI a more modern facelift. Players were given the ability to customize it more, everything was given a cleaner and more compact look, and it all works a lot better. During The War Within, the studio has updated it even more, with changes to the map, quest log, and the spellbook. However, even with these changes, some players have found that nothing beats those UI add-ons.
 </p>
 <h3 id="wow-needs-to-improve-things-for-new-players">
  WoW Needs to Improve Things For New Players
 </h3>
 <p>
  If players want the best
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  UI possible, then they often have to turn to UI add-ons to get that. While veteran players will likely have no problem finding those, new players may not have the same experience. Many just want to jump into the world of Azeroth and explore everything that it has to offer, and downloading all sorts of add-ons arguably wastes time better spent playing. There are countless options to sort through and many guides debating about which ones are actually worth the download, making the entire process a bit overwhelming. Plus, the more add-ons that players have, the longer it takes to log in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hopefully, Blizzard has more plans to improve the UI over the next couple of updates and expansion packs. The studio has already overhauled some of the worst aspects of the UI, so now it just has to take it a step further. While players should always have the option to shake things up with
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  add-ons, they should not feel like they need to. The base UI should fill all the most important aspects, and the add-ons should simply be there for those that want to take it to the next level.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the day, the way the UI looks and feels does come down to personal preference.
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's base UI may be clunky and in need of some more upgrades, but it is still very much useable, and some new players may not even notice its issues. That being said, it does still lack some functionality and usability that add-ons have fixed, and Blizzard really needs to catch up with that.

  has to offer. Gray's Last Hunt side quest is no different, during which players get a chance to go toe-to-toe with a unique mutant boss called the Hornhead. It's a really tough mutant to beat, given how the bullets just bounce off the parts of its body that are covered in armored scales. However, there's a way to take it down quickly; let's discuss how.

  Players can start Gray's Last Hunt side mission right
  <strong>
   after completing the Dark Times
  </strong>
  main mission in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . You'll need to head back to the Pile Driver POI in the Red Forest region and talk to Arkhyp Lichen about Gray's job. He'll share how Freedom stashed some loot in a boar cave, but another mutant arrived at the location and chased everyone out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mission is to track the mysterious mutant and get a huge reward for it. Once the dialog is over, you'll need to head west to the objective marker to track down the mutant. Once you arrive at the open field, Hornhead will appear, leading to a fight with the mutant.

  Hornhead is an
  <strong>
   armored mutant
  </strong>
  that resembles a moose but with a disfigured body. It's got sharp horns and armor scales on its body that will ricochet bullets while inflicting insignificant damage to it. During the fight with the Hornhead, boars, rodents, and blind dogs will also spawn in the area, making the fight a lot trickier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hornhead will use the following attacks on the players.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Horn Charge
   </strong>
   : The mutant will frequently lower its head and charge at the players with horns pointed at them. If hit, the attack will stagger players and make them fall to the ground.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Roar
   </strong>
   : It's a rarer attack than the horn charge, during which the mutant will get on its hind legs and unleash a powerful roar that can disorient players as well as (potentially) summon more mutants to guard it.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The best weapon to use against the Hornhead is a
  <strong>
   shotgun
  </strong>
  , most preferably a Saiga D-12. It's best to target the beast on the neck or either on the head, right under its big horns. Landing enough shots will bring the Hornhead mutant down. Once it's down, make sure to loot the stashes in a cave nearby for some additional loot.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you're leaving the area, Arkhyp will radio Skif and reward him with
  <strong>
   18000 coupons as a reward
  </strong>
  . This will mark Gray's Last Hunt side quest in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  as complete.

  The small forward is a position that is often not talked about enough in the NBA, and this applies to its place in
  <strong>
   <em>
    NBA 2K25
   </em>
  </strong>
  as well. While everyone can discuss the point guards and fawn over the centers effectively, it's probably going to take some time to find a person who can aptly name the small forwards of the league. However,
  <strong>
   this doesn't mean that the small forward is any less important
  </strong>
  to a team's chemistry in a game. Much like the power forward, the small forward is a nice compromise between the center and the guards, offering greater strength than a guard with quicker speed than a center.
 </p>
 <p>
  This blending of the two means that
  <strong>
   a small forward can often be a great option
  </strong>
  for players looking to break into the MyCareer mode of the game with their built character. It takes off the pressure of having to run the offense as a point guard and push your way through the paint as a big man. Plus, being able to excel at any location on the court cannot be understated. Now, not every team is going to be looking for a small forward when a player enters the league, which means there are only a few that are going to be your best bet.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated January 18, 2025 by Shane Black:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   As the NBA season enters its halfway mark, more teams have emerged in need of help at the small forward position. Because of this, this list was updated to provide further context to the teams already on the list but also add teams who have shown to be in need. It also received more in-text links to other guides to help players even more and give them the best possible chance to dominate the league.

  The Brooklyn Nets are not a good team, to be blunt. As such,
  <strong>
   they need a lot of help
  </strong>
  and have a ton of openings for players to become starters. Though they have Bojan Bogdanovic, he is not lighting the score sheet up by any means, and a new player who can score with efficiency can easily overtake him in the line-up.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there won't be immediate success with the Nets,
  <strong>
   they do have a future through their current rebuild
  </strong>
  . Getting in on the ground floor can be a great benefit for the player.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Lavine is constantly in trade talks
  </li>
  <li>
   In desperate need of depth at the position
  </li>
  <li>
   Could see some success coming their way
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Bulls is a weird team to recommend, but there is logic to it: their starting small forward, Zach Lavine, has been the face of the team for a long time, but
  <strong>
   his name has been tossed around in trade talks for quite some time as well
  </strong>
  . When a player's name appears so often when discussing trades, it usually signifies some real possibility of that trade happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  But even if that trade doesn't happen,
  <strong>
   being a bench player on this team wouldn't be a bad thing
  </strong>
  as there would still be a ton of playing time. The team has some flaws, but they have enough talent to make something happen with the right moves. Getting a new small forward who can back Lavine, or take over for him once he's traded, could be just what they need to have some relevance come back to the storied franchise.

   Andrew Wiggins can easily be overcome on the depth chart

   Curry's presence means easier defenses to go against

  <li>
   A good mix of young and experienced vets to make a playoff run
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite his prominent role in the Warriors' 2022 championship run, Andrew Wiggins has returned to earth. While far from a true detriment on the court, Wiggins has
  <strong>
   certainly opened the door for another player to come to the team
  </strong>
  and take that starting role from him. With the team struggling overall to score and keep a lead, a new small forward that can be productive would do a lot for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   It won't be an immediate starting position
  </strong>
  , but with the right play, it won't last very long at all. If players can fulfill their roles effectively, providing the defense and shooting abilities that Wiggins showed flashes of, then they will see their roles elevated in no time.

   Dillon Brooks is fallible and can be benched

 <p>
  The Houston Rockets are in a different kind of situation because Dillon Brooks is their starting small forward, and he has shown to be a solid option at that position.
  <strong>
   His calling card is his defense
  </strong>
  and ability to get into the head of his opponent, while he can also provide some offense sporadically.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
  <strong>
   his offensive production is not nearly enough to solidify him as a permanent fixture
  </strong>
  in that starting line. If a player can come in and match his defense while also providing more consistent offense than him, then a starting role will open up. Plus, the Rockets are on an upward trajectory and a player can get in on the ground floor here to see success for the future.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Lebron can always generate playmaking
  </li>
  <li>
   Besides AD, the Lakers need consistent scoring
  </li>
  <li>
   A fringe playoff team
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Lakers have once again found themselves in a weird situation: they are not awful, but they are also not great. Because of this, the team is sitting in a place where they will be in the Play-In games come the NBA playoffs. To get themselves out of that spot,
  <strong>
   they could use a small forward
  </strong>
  to elevate their scoring.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lebron is technically the small forward, but he really doesn't belong to one position. So having him on the court, along with AD
  <strong>
   and a new small forward
  </strong>
  , could be a potent combination to bring the team to a more consistent place.

 <ul>
  <li>
   A guaranteed second-string role
  </li>
  <li>
   Wolves are rising as a top team in the league
  </li>
  <li>
   A starting role isn't too far away
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Timberwolves are showing that they are here to stay in the NBA after their run to the Western Conference Finals last season. When it comes to small forwards, as well,
  <strong>
   there is certainly a need for depth
  </strong>
  . While Jayden McDaniels is their starter and will stay that way for the foreseeable future, their second-string small forward is Joe Ingles. Ingles has been a staple of the league for a while and is getting older. McDaniels has not been quite as effective as fans were hoping for, meaning that should a younger, quicker player come to the team, he could see his role moved to the second string and Ingle made irrelevant.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   McDaniels is going to be the starter for a while
  </strong>
  , but not forever. If a player can have patience and give it a season or two, they could see a starting spot open up sooner rather than later.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Franz Wagner hasn't taken the starting role for himself
  </li>
  <li>
   Lots of young talent on the team
  </li>
  <li>
   A bench spot is guaranteed
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Orlando Magic have been knocking at the door of success for a couple of years now, and they just haven't been able to break through. This could easily change with the addition of a strong small forward that can
  <strong>
   elevate the team around them
  </strong>
  . Right now, Franz Wagner has the starting spot for this role and has not done a ton to cement his status there. While he has had flashes of excellence, he just hasn't been consistent enough to make fans say he is the unanimous choice to have there. And with his injury causing him to miss extended time, the door is open for another player.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means a new small forward
  <strong>
   has a real shot of taking that starting spot from Wagner
  </strong>
  , provided they can do what he does and even more. This isn't too difficult and could see the Magic becoming a solid team that can make some noise come playoff time.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Scottie Barnes has the starting spot, but the team needs depth
  </li>
  <li>
   Bruce Brown hasn't reached his Nuggets level
  </li>
  <li>
   A young team that can develop
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Toronto Raptors have their starting small forward, which may turn some players off. However, t
  <strong>
   he bench spot is certainly up for grabs
  </strong>
  and will bring solid minutes. Bruce Brown is currently on the bench as a small forward, but he has yet to reach the levels he did when he helped the Nuggets win a championship two years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Being a consistent bench player is nothing to scoff at
  </strong>
  , and with the young talent on the roster, the players could quickly see the team become far more potent in the East.
